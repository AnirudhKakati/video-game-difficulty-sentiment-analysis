            <h3>Overview of Video Game Difficulty and Player Sentiment</h3>
            <p>
                Video games are an artform, and just like any other form of art they exhibit a wide range of styles and genres which cater to diverse tastes among different gaming enthusiasts. 
                While some players thrive on challenging gameplay, finding satisfaction in overcoming tough obstacles, others may experience frustration or even abandon a game if it becomes too difficult. 
                This makes difficulty levels a fundamental aspect of game design that significantly influences player experience and engagement. 
                Finding the right balance in difficulty is crucial as it directly impacts player sentiment, i.e. how players feel about the game overall.  
                Player sentiment can range from excitement and satisfaction to frustration and disappointment, and these emotions are often influenced by how well the game's difficulty aligns with the player's skill level and expectations. 
                Understanding this relationship between game difficulty and player sentiment is essential for game developers aiming to create experiences that are both challenging and enjoyable.

            <h3>Importance of understanding player sentiment</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding player sentiment is vital for developers because it directly affects the success of a game. 
                Video games are a product that developers create and the players are customers for that product. 
                Positive sentiment often translates into higher player retention, more word-of-mouth referrals, and better reviews, all of which contribute to a game's commercial success. 
                Conversely, negative sentiment can lead to decreased player engagement, poor reviews, and ultimately, a decline in sales. 
                By analyzing player sentiment, developers can identify areas where a game might be too challenging or not challenging enough and make adjustments to improve the overall player experience. 
                This understanding can also inform future game designs, helping developers strike the right balance between difficulty and enjoyment. 
                From a financial perspective, all of this helps the developers, the companies behind them, or any other stakeholders involved, in maximizing profit.

            <h3>Who is affected by game difficulty?</h3>
            <p>
                Game difficulty affects a wide range of players, from casual gamers who play for relaxation to hardcore gamers who seek out extreme challenges. 
                Each player demographic has different expectations and tolerances for difficulty, making it a complex aspect to manage. 
                Casual gamers might prefer a more relaxed experience with easier progression, while hardcore gamers may enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes with overcoming difficult challenges. 
                Additionally, game difficulty can also impact community sentiment, where groups of players discuss and share their experiences, influencing the broader perception of the game. 
                Adversely, game difficulty also affects the people and the institutions involved in making them, both in terms of reputation as well as financial success.

            <h3>The Evolution of Game Difficulty and Its Relevance Today</h3>
            <p>
                Game difficulty has evolved significantly over the years, from the brutally challenging arcade games of the 1980s designed to keep players spending money, to the more balanced, story-driven experiences of today. 
                Early video games often relied on difficulty to maintain engagement, as replayability was a key factor in their design. 
                However, modern games now offer a variety of difficulty options, allowing players to customize their experience. 
                Titles like <i>Dark Souls</i> and <i>Elden Ring</i> are known for their unforgiving gameplay, gaining a dedicated following of players who seek out challenging experiences. 
                On the other hand, games like <i>Animal Crossing</i> or <i>Stardew Valley</i> cater to a more relaxed audience, offering low-pressure gameplay. 
                This shift in the landscape reflects the growing importance of player choice and accessibility in game design. 
                Today, difficulty settings are not just about adjusting enemy health or damageâ€”they also address cognitive challenges, puzzles, and story decisions, ensuring broader appeal. 
                This diversity in gameplay difficulty highlights the need for developers to understand how different difficulty modes affect player sentiment across genres, which is precisely what this project aims to explore. 
                By analyzing sentiment across a range of games, we hope to provide insights that can help future games balance challenge with enjoyment, contributing to a richer and more inclusive gaming experience.

            <h3>Current state of research and gaps in current understanding </h3>
            <p>
                Research in the field of video game difficulty and player sentiment has made strides, but significant gaps remain, particularly in the role of player-generated feedback. 
                While many studies have explored how difficulty influences player engagement, less attention has been paid to how players express difficulty perceptions in written reviews. 
                Existing research often overlooks the value of review meta-data, such as sentiment scores and review length, and how these features correlate with mentions of difficulty. 
                Additionally, the relationship between a game's genre and difficulty perceptions remains underexplored. 
                This project aims to address these gaps by analyzing review content, meta-data, and genre-specific trends to understand how difficulty is perceived and expressed by players. 
                By doing so, we hope to provide actionable insights for developers seeking to create more tailored and satisfying gameplay experiences.
