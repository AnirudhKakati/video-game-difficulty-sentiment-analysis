The puzzles are smart and gradually get trickier, keeping you on your toes.\nThe story is told without a lot of dialogue, but it’s still powerful and makes you think. With its simple but striking art style, Inside offers a unique and unforgettable experience. It’s definitely a must-play for anyone who loves indie games!",

I wasted a good amount of time just making the character turn around, hop, run, etc... just because it was so fun to watch. Scratched my brain very nicely. I also just cannot say enough about the storytelling and worldbuilding; it's intriguing and mysterious and so well made in the way it just unfolds throughout the play. I went into this without reading anything about the game (bought as a bundle on a pretty big discount) and was just stunned.\n\nThe only downside is, really, that because I played this first, I couldn't enjoy Limbo. At all. It just seemed like the clunky, awkward brother of Inside that tags along to hangouts and sours the mood. Every time I jump or interact with objects in Limbo I can't help but think \"This would feel so much better in Inside.\" So there's that. If you have the choice, play Limbo first. Otherwise, Inside will probably ruin that experience :')",

My advice is get the secrete ending after the normal ending for better experience.\r\n\r\nPOSITIVES:\r\n1. The game has a good gamplay and a less game-hour\r\n2. The game has has a very good ending (secret ending). Literally it was MINDBLOWING.\r\n3. Optimisation is good, in my gameplay I faced no glitches and bugs.\r\n4. The game is too dark and for those people who love Dark and gritty game, they'll love this game.\r\n5. The lore is so dark and so heavy.\r\n\r\nNEGATIVES:\r\n1. Some people like to play colourfull and light game, for them this isn't the one.\r\n2. The story of the is not linear, means you have to unlock or know the secret ending to get the true story.\r\n3. Only the Lore is the game is explained well, the players should grasp their own story (in normal ending).",

        "review": "[h1][b] TLDR: \"We have Little Nightmares at home\" vibe. A good and creepy setting, but LN1 and 2 are leagues better. [/b] [/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]PROS: [/h1]\r\n✅Dark and unsettling atmosphere\r\n✅Generally good logical puzzles\r\n\r\n[h1]CONS: [/h1]\r\n➖All achievements are missable \r\n➖Some occasional backtracking slog\r\n➖Entirely new puzzle elements at the very end throw out everything you’ve learned so far\r\n➖Unclear plot\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOOKTOBER REVIEW #1\r\n[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative/Length) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nGame World: Inside’s game world is dark, unsettling, and just plain creepy. The developer also made Limbo, which is similar to Inside, but I would say that Inside is also very similar to Little Nightmares (LN). Like LN, Inside is a side-scrolling dark/horror themed game with a subtle plot and no speaking parts. In Inside you play as a nameless boy who must evade captors to go….somewhere.\r\n\r\nNarrative: LN at the very least had a more concrete direction in which the game shepherded the player. In Inside, everything is pretty much left up to interpretation. You have no real idea what is happening and even the ending(s) don’t do much to help. \r\nOverall, I wasn’t a fan of how the game left me with more questions than answers and despite the well-made world itself, the lack of a narrative or at the very least an explanation kind of made the experience not worth it. \r\n\r\nLength: This is a short game and can be completed in 3.5 hours, assuming you don’t go for the 2nd ending. \r\n\r\n[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nMechanics: The only mechanics that Inside has are puzzle-oriented. Your control scheme is pretty much jump and grab/interact. I found the puzzles to be generally creative and utilizing the game world well. \r\nPuzzles generally consist of moving objects to gain a higher ground, timing oriented jumps/object interaction, evading enemies by either hiding or using the environment creatively, and interacting with the environment. There wasn’t much platforming here and while you can fail and will die (probably a lot), I found the checkpoint system forgiving enough. \r\nAs the boy you spend about 3 hours learning various aspects of how puzzles interact with the world, then the last 30 minutes everything you learned is thrown out because you control a new character. I felt that this kind of took away from the “Escape” setting that you were in because while you’re trying to escape the zone, you are also fumbling around re-learning concepts all over again. It just makes a really strange setting even stranger but for the wrong reasons. \r\n\r\nDifficulty: Throughout the game there were about 2 or 3 puzzles that really made me stuck, but overall as far as the difficulty it's kind of like Portal where if you look around enough, you’ll probably start to piece together what you need to do. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Performance) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nQuality: Inside has some great graphics and physics. I especially loved the part where you smash an NPC and are covered in viscera until you go in the water. Very nice touches and also good physics. \r\n\r\nPerformance: From a pure technical side, there is really only the option to do resolution and brightness. I would have at the very least wanted a frame limiter as there is no reason for me to run the game at a constant 250 FPS. Regardless, Inside lacks that and that’s what I ran the game at. No stuttering or bugs of any kind. \r\ni9-13900KF | RTX 4090 | 64GB RAM | 1440p @ 240hz | installed on SSD\r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Audio (Sound Effects/Music) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nSound Effects: Well done, fits perfectly within the setting of being unsettling. There is no voice acting in this game other than NPC grunts and other sounds of exertion. The best part of the sound effects is bringing the game world to life with the sound of rain, footsteps, and metallic chain clinkings. \r\n\r\nMusic: Inside didn’t really have a noticeable soundtrack. There were parts where some slight musical notes occurred, but nothing worth noting here. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [3/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nThe only reason to replay this is to get the alternate ending and for all (missable) achievements. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nIf you like Little Nightmares, you should play Inside. I personally found LN 1 and 2 to be better than Inside from every aspect. I think the biggest reason why I prefer LN over Inside is that I have no idea what is happening in Inside. While at the ending of LN, especially #2, my mind was blown. I’m all for subtle endings that leave the meaning up to player interpretation, but I didn’t feel a strong enough connection to anything that really happened throughout the game. \r\nStill, Inside is worth giving a shot if you enjoy these types of creepy side-scrolling games. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Recommend?

Very nice game, pretty creepy and weird, still didn't catch the all point of the facility. But very nice. Many things to do. \r\n\r\nI kinda regret not playing it with the sound on, as I discoverd towards the end that this game has got a fabulous sound design. Well done. \r\n\r\nI totally recommend playing it. Plus it doesn't require lots of gaming skills, since you can play it with only one hand, and two fingers.",

There are sections that are calm while others are hard and have obstacles to get throughout the game. There are dogs, people, and ither things in this game that will try to kill you. For the game you can beat it in under 4 hours if you know what your doing. I give this game a 9 out of 10. Have a good day.",

There are so many unique ideas and creative elements woven throughout the game, which makes it stand out from a lot of others. Sure, there are some hard challenges that can get frustrating at times, but that’s part of what makes it so satisfying when you finally beat them. The atmosphere, the sound design, and the puzzle mechanics all come together beautifully, making the game as enjoyable as it is thought-provoking.",

        "review": "This review should be treated as a sort of sequel to my review of the developer's previous game, Limbo, which I reviewed negatively. I actually bought this because I wanted it, instead of Limbo which ended up in my library ~10 years ago via an old school Humble Bundle. If you're not old enough to remember those, you'd get 7-8 indie games for whatever you wanted to pay, even 0.01. Most of the games on offer were trashy and well past their prime time for sales, but they'd sometimes contain gems.\n\nInside fixes the main problem that Limbo has - that it doesn't do anything of note with the mood that it creates. In contrast, Inside has something to say that, at least by 2016 standards, isn't the standard indie platformer regurgitation of Psychology/Sociology 101. It does scare you, it contains plenty of dark humour, the puzzles make more sense and it tones down the abstraction just enough.\n\nI am particularly impressed by the animations, which give me strong Prince of Persia vibes. Inside has loads of cool platformer gimmicks that could, in a way, define it as a tech (design?) demo - there is so much potential here for similar mechanics in a larger, perhaps less minimalistic game. As a game, the puzzles are mostly process of elimination stuff, rather than anything to get your brain turning. As a piece of art, it's amazing. \n\nBut that's the thing. While I enjoy Inside FAR more than Limbo, like most indies of that era, it lingers on \"the message\" far too much at the expense of the gameplay. Having said that, it's incredibly satisfying to play and a nice quiet break from the Doom binge I've been on recently.\n\nAnyway, please can someone look at what PC platformers were doing in the mid-late 90s and... well do that but with the puzzles and \"message\" seen here in Inside. There's a HUGE gap in the market for that. Jazz Jackrabbit 2, from 1998, feels more modern than most if not all platformers released today, even in 2024. (Outside of Nintendo of course)\n\n...**** it, maybe I'll make that game. Famous last words: How hard can it be?",

Just that for MY personal taste, I like Limbo more because of the looks and the puzzles but I still enjoyed INSIDE - specially the ending part of this game had my mouth open! \n\nLittle Spoiler: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope you like wrecking balls",

You can complete the whole game in one play and forget about the time. The only regret (very small) is that the story still has some unreasonable and quite forced places.\n[b]Anyway, you must play this game.[/b]",

The environment’s art style is great and gives out a sense of grandeur in decay, of depressing human degradation. Supported by excellent sound effects and animations, it’s creepy in many alternating and surprising ways. There are some easy, yet interesting puzzles, but mostly you’ll just move, jump and grab your way through unchallenged. I was disappointed by its sort duration (about 6 hours being thorough) and its story's ending, which will leave you confused as hell. Some of the 14 secrets are hard to find, so search for them online if you don’t have the patience, for they reward you with a secret ending to mess you up even more.",

While the gameplay is solid—offering clever puzzles and tight platforming—the true gem lies in its disturbingly atmospheric world and unsettling narrative. From the moment you step into its shadowy landscape, you're enveloped in a sense of dread and curiosity that keeps you engaged.\r\n\r\nThe visuals are striking, with a minimalist aesthetic that complements the grim setting perfectly. Each environment tells its own story, filled with eerie details that invite exploration yet leave you feeling vulnerable. The sound design further enhances this experience, with ambient noises that evoke a constant sense of unease.\r\n\r\nAs for the plot, it’s a mind-bending journey that defies conventional storytelling. Without giving too much away, the narrative is filled with surreal twists that provoke thought long after the credits roll. It’s one of those stories that makes you question everything you’ve experienced and leaves you pondering the deeper themes of control and conformity.\r\n\r\nOverall, Inside is a solid 8/10. It masterfully combines gameplay and atmosphere into a gripping, immersive experience. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge your mind and unsettle your spirit, this is a must-play.",

        "review": "I press 'X' and a small, childlike, faceless silhouetted avatar tumbles down a cliff-edge and lands on a mysterious, barren 2D landscape. No foreshadowing, no context, nothing.\n\nI move the left analog stick to the right and he starts to walk. His tiny feet splash through murky puddles as he attempts to navigate his way through a seemingly uninhabited forest, before encountering two ominous characters, after exiting a large truck, slightly off the beaten path. They seem to be looking for something. Their flashlights are the only things that light up the surrounding darkness. I'm not sure why, but it's probably for the best that they don't know I'm here. I keep moving, stealthily taking cover behind anything I pass; trees, boulders, abandoned RVs, anything I can find, as I descend downwards alongside an apparent country road. It's not long before my footprints are discovered by their canine companions, and a chase ensues. I have no idea what's happening, but my instinct is to run.\n\nI run for miles. It turns out there's many more of these figures, and they all have vehicles, so I must utilize everything in my immediate vicinity to remain hidden. I jump fences, climb foothills and power through water-drenched crevices as I avoid my mysterious pursuers' line-of-sight, before landing at the door of a dilapidated warehouse located on the outskirts of an abandoned industrial estate.\n\nAs I progress through the interconnected rooms of this gigantic warehouse, I'm faced with incredibly unusual, yet creatively original puzzles, like telepathically manipulating the movements of strangely deformed looking citizens, by standing on top of a dead pig and placing my head into a helmet-like device. Or by playing some sort of elaborate game of musical chairs, as I attempt to blend into the foreground with other slave-like remnants under the preying eye of tyrannical overseeers, as we shuffle in formation down an assembly line of a manufacturing plant, eerily similar to those seen in 'Another Brick in the Wall', or even Nazi Germany concentration camps.\n\nOnce I break out into the exterior of the manufacturing plant, and continue my journey through a seemingly fallen society, traversing derelict, abbatoir-like farms, and swimming in leech-infested waters, I'm captivated by Inside's minimalistic storytelling, and how it conveys its narrative through incredible animations and theatrical physics. \n\nThe further I progress, the more I get the recurring feeling that I'm exploring a world completely and utterly void of life in the traditional sense. A distant monochromatic eeriness tells the story of something that was once here but hasn't been for a very long time.\nDue to the fact the entirety of the game takes place over the course of one night, as dawn starts to rise, and after a few more exaggerated gruesome deaths, and genuinely unsettling clutch chase scenes, resulting in death only ever feeling like a hair's breath away, I finally encounter a gigantic blob of human flesh, functioning as a network, hidden in the depths of a secret underground facility, surrounded by a large group of fascinated scientists who had been conducting experiments on the game's population. It's now my duty to integrate myself into the human blob, assume the role of the now self-aware network, escape the facility by any means necessary, and seek potential freedom from the oppressive overseers.    \n\nDue to the vagueness of the game's narrative, as all in-game conciousness; such as farm-life, citizens, and even the player character, slowly gravitates towards this network hive-mind near the games end, in its attempts to become sentient, led many to believe the player character is under the control of an unseen force like the aforementioned hive-mind. Some believe the unseen force is the game player themselves. Some have even gone as far as to speculate the player character being an anomoly in the corrupt facility's network and therefore a possible representation of free will. \n\nMy personal opinion is the beauty in its narrative or lack thereof lies in its ambiguity, and having a fixed plotline could go so far as to tarnish what may seem like simply a sequel to Playground Games' 2008 2D side-scroller Limbo.\nHowever, if you dig a little deeper, you can uncover multiple layers of staggering storytelling complexity that many games in this genre haven't before touched on. Inside is a game that can never be fully appreciated unless played completely blind in the first playthrough, with no prior research. It's also far more than what it appears on the surface, although its surface is still incredibly beautiful.   \n\nBaby we were born to run.",

There is no dialogue in the game, and it is the graphics of the game that took responsibility for attracting the player's attention. I shouldn't spoil the story, but unfortunately, the last scenes of the game were not pleasant, so I don't recommend them for those with a delicate and sensitive spirit.\nBecause of the discount on the game and the rich story, I recommend it.

If you enjoy 2D platformer games like Little Nightmares and Limbo this one does not disappoint",

Dog chase scenes get super tedious super fast.\n2. b: After the sewers I kind of got fed up with the game and it seems the dogs are generally hated in the game too.\n3. Light-avoiding puzzles at a point felt too game-y and forced. They were fine like the first time only.\n4. Overdoing the same exact puzzles just too many times.\n5. Many puzzles are like this: You have to do exactly a certain thing or else you insta-fail.\n6. There's barely any story telling. The visual story elements don't tell enough.\n7. At a point, there is this explosion area which was never explained.\n8. trying to avoid certain killshots or deaths were also really terrible and honestly could've been left out.\n9. Only the start was interesting but after 20 minutes I kept hoping it to end.\n10. Certain puzzles require so much running back and forward and it almost made be quit.\n\nPros:\n1. Beautiful visuals.\n2. Interesting lore which wasn't really explained. I'm sure the creators know what the game is truly about but not the player.\n3. Audio design.\n4. Music.\n\nSo yeah, this game wasn't even close to as good as I thought. It was just freaking weird for the sake of being weird and didn't bother to explain itself enough. It did explain some but honestly not enough to satisfy.\n\nThis game is dark. Like really DARK. I don't mean just the visuals but... you'll see.\n\nI hope this studio keeps cooking these game up because this had such potential. I'm sorry to say this, but this would've been pretty much perfect if it was a 3D 1st person game and allowed the player to look their surroundings. And took out the insta-fail puzzles. I get why it was made as it is. But... Oh well.",

The gameplay isn't bad, and the puzzles are fun, but don't expect this game to wow you or really blow your socks off with visuals. The storytelling is good, but the ending really doesn't answer any questions. Overall it's probably a good game, but if you've played Limbo, you've played this game. Get it on a discount. If steam let me leave a neutral review, I would do that. I'm not disappointed that I spent just shy of 3 hours playing it, and doing it with a bit of inebriation does up the level of fun, but there's nothing new here really. \n\nIf you are a huge fan of limbo or little nightmares, this is the type of game for you. If you're like me and came away from Limbo thinking that it was enough, pick this up on a discount like I did, or just move on. I'd give the game a solid 6/10.",

If you get stuck sleep on it and come back. Don't look up a guide, you'll get it. And DO NOT just watch someone else play on twitch or youtube. This game NEEDS to be played, figured out, and experienced completely first hand.\r\n\r\nIt's extremely special.",

This brings the game closer to a Freudian dream, subtly weaving together the fears of a small (or perhaps not so small) child.\n\nA solid adventure worth replaying in five years or so. A significant milestone for 2.5-D games, one that helped define an entire genre.",

Highly recommended, genuinely think that everyone should experience this game (although it is a little spooky / gory so not advised for small children) - a left / right puzzle scroller with only two actions possible (jump or pick-up / move) so not over complicated but with amazingly well thought out game play which is well weighted and moves along well with plenty of jumping off points for when it's time to quit until next time. So many different sections to it and different challenges to overcome and at the full 2024 price of £17 it's amazing value (although i did get it in the sale so stick it in your Wishlist now in case it comes back round!)",

        "review": "This game is fantastic and a massive improvement on Limbo. Limbo was a charming game with very evident flaws. While Inside is not flawless, it has greatly improved on its predecessor. Inside is a game that will make you think for hours after completing it. The story of Inside is perfection, I did not find the story confusing in the slightest and thought that both the regular and secret endings were fantastic. The puzzles for the most part are brilliant and improved greatly from Limbo's. \n\nMy only knock on the game would be more of a personal preference but I don't think this is the type of game that should have trial-and-error puzzles found in the section with that mermaid thing, and more rely on the brain-wracking but still fair puzzles seen through most of the game.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a good 6 hours of phenomenal storytelling. However, if you need a game to be fast-paced the whole time I might pass on this one. \n\n100%ing this game is astronomically better than Limbo's as it doesn't require you to beat the game with five deaths or less.\n\nI would give this game a 9/10 and would highly recommend.",

When I started playing this, movement animation is the first thing that impress me. Dang it! That red shirt kid has such smooth move. Sound design fits its atmosphere. Story-telling is like Limbo's thing. It tells you nothing. Don't worry if you feel so confused after finishing it. You are not the only one. Game-play is fun although the puzzles are easier than Limbo. Personally, it's much easier than I thought. This game is not that challenging. Completing 100% achievement is not that hard. Overall 8/10 I don't guarantee you like it. Try it yourself.",

The minimalist design, coupled with the haunting soundscape, creates a sense of unease that feels similar to Little Nightmares, while still maintaining its own unique identity. The puzzles are well-crafted and blend seamlessly with the storytelling, keeping you engaged without breaking the flow of the game. I also really liked the reactions of the NPCs walking in the background, as they responded to what was happening in front of them, adding depth to the world.",

It's a dark and weird 2.5D puzzley adventure with an amazing art direction and cool ideas.\r\n\r\nIt's short, sure, but it doesn't waste time; most of it is puzzles or action or something cool going on. It's a nice 1-2 day game that feels satisfying and I 100%ed it.",

        "review": "I purchased LIMBO on sale for $2, tried it, and hated it. It was one of the most boring games I’ve ever played. So, when INSIDE was recommended to me as a better game I thought “What the heck? $5 on sale, it can't get much worse”. It can. And it did.\r\n\r\nVisuals 6/10\r\nThe colors were better than LIMBO, but still lacked diversity.\r\n- The constant grays made the whole game feel dull. I would have loved a slight color shift for each of the different building sections (1, 2, 3, 4) to make each part distinct\r\n- The backgrounds were more detailed and interesting compared to LIMBO\r\n- I would have loved little pops of red to tie in the boy you play as to the world. The yellow wires and pink bars did a great job of grabbing attention, I would have loved to see more of that\r\n\r\nAudio 3/10\r\nThere was nothing that stood out about the audio/atmosphere. It just felt like generic and empty space.\r\n- The dogs were loud AF. There is audio control but it is master volume, not specific to ambience vs sound effects\r\n- The ambience wasn’t obviously different depending on the space. It would have been cooler if there was specific sound triggers to differentiate the sections\r\n\r\nGameplay 4/10\r\nThere was potential for a lot of innovative and interesting mechanics, but nothing was fleshed out.\r\n- Similar to LIMBO, there was a lot of box pushing, which gets old after 5 min--let alone 3 hours\r\n- The mind control was one of the best mechanics that was very unique to INSIDE and provided information about the world\r\n- Some of the most compelling mechanics were only used once and then never seen again. For example: The pig with the leech, the chicks in the barn, walking in line with other victims and the security robots with spotlight eyes that are LITERALLY in the banner for the game\r\n\r\nHorror 3/10\r\nThis was not a horror game. Anything that was remotely horrific was underwhelming, and it made INSIDE feel like more of a puzzle game than anything else.\r\n- These were the scariest aspects of the game:\r\nThe banging door you needed 20 people to open. I was horrified by the loud sounds but the moment I entered the room and realized it was just a shockwave mechanism I was no longer scared.\r\nThe underwater scenes. I was worried there would be a giant fish/shark creature attacking me, but instead it was a small siren creature. Once I realized there was nothing else in the water, it wasn’t scary at all.\r\nThe dogs. This fear came from the fact that their audio is SO FUCKING LOUD, and they get very close to the character right before you make your escape.\r\n- Most of these “scary” aspects really just come from the fear of the unknown, which makes this game much less enjoyable during a replay due to the fact you know what/where everything is\r\n\r\nStory 0/10\r\nThere are many games in existence with an open-ended story that is up to interpretation of the viewers. This is not one of those games. \r\n- The game began very similarly to LIMBO with a boy awakening in a forest area. This opening feels uninspired and lacking. It would have been much more interesting to see the character run away from home and travel through his hometown, rather than in a random forest with no meaning in the plot\r\n- The main part of the game takes place in flooded and machine filled laboratories. This can be interesting for a bit, but after spending hours in it, it no longer has intrigue. The game should include a variety of environments, like expanding on the farmland with infested animals or even--I don’t know--THE FOREST\r\n-INSIDE and LIMBO share the honor of having an abrupt and questionable ending, both including smashing through a wall to emerge in the forest and having no further movement until the credits roll\r\n\r\nSummary 3/10\r\nAgain Playdead comes through with another boring, box-pushing “horror” game. Stripped to its bones it is practically a carbon copy of LIMBO and is definitely not worth $20. Thank you for your time, and to all a goodnight.\r\n",

        "review": "WORTH EVERY EURO\n(got it from sale).\nThis game is probably one of the best examples that graphic does not always matter and how sound design and even the simplest models can change your whole view on something in a game. I personally love puzzle games, I always loved them, and I just have to say that the overall experience is just insanely good. The puzzles are not too hard but not too easy as well (Prepare yourself getting stuck on solving some of them [or maybe don't, I at least did]). The entire stories behind it is not very clear, but that's just a small critique. If you take some time to experience and appreciate at our surroundings while exploring, you will be able to create your own story and thoughts about the situation the protagonist struggles to active success.\nJust to wrap it up: A very fun game and immersive experience",

There no cheap happy or sad moments (or any moments of that type at all), there not any line of dialogue, it's the most muted color palette you can think without being grey scale.  There no faces to express feelings on the characters. Music is almost beat-less. THIS IS THE MOST MINIMALIST GAME YOU CAN PLAY. And still delivers a top-notch experience from beginning to end.  it' intrigue you enough that you can play it easy on one sitting. \n\nWhen you study filming, you found out there tools to tell stories and these tools where implemented because there weren't too many resources to tell a Story (mostly old movies). PLAYDEAD STUDIOS implement this cinematic language so well, Like Bresson avoid to used emotional manipulative language to tell a story, or Tarkovsky weight of atmosphere on scene.  This game is so well done that they give you the whole short experience and you feel that there not a moment wasted on the whole game. i'm impressed too that there horror in the game and they don't add a  jump scare that feel intentional or forced. everything come at certain moment that i still debatable that if they are jump scares or not, but there moments that feels like jump scares. \n\nThere things i don't like for matter of taste like [spoiler] that one puzzle of the hook, the sirens and using your feet to attracted his/her position [/spoiler] or [spoiler] the ambiguous ending [/spoiler] but these decision goes perfect with the experience even if they are not my taste. \n\n\nI see games like this, Outer Wilds and Subnautica as the future of storytelling. INSIDE take what games like Another World, Flashback or Oddworld and make the perfect game for the genre. i can't imagine the people who are waiting for a sequel or another game from the studio since 2016.\n\n\nPLEASE PLAY THIS GAME ON A MONITOR OR TELEVISION. I play it on the switch for the first time 2 years ago and i just play it for half of the game and forget about it. i dont find it bad but tin this occasion i found that appreciate it the details on a bigger screen make the diference.",

It does not have \"challenging puzzles.\"  It's not \"narrative-driven.\"  Nothing in it remotely qualifies as \"intense action.\"\n\nThe puzzles would be fun enough if the pace of the game were a bit faster.  As it is now, solving the puzzles in your head is much faster than actually implementing them in the game.  Several involve repetitive tasks where failing puts you back to the beginning.\n\nThere's no narrative; there's just a lot of loosely connected abstract horror that ultimately doesn't amount to anything.",

        "review": "This is quite simply one of the most hauntingly beautiful puzzle-platformers I've ever played. INSIDE is devoid of dialogue, let alone definitive answers, but its tight, thought-provoking gameplay will keep you pushing forward at every turn. What are you running from? Why are you in danger? Who even are you? Honestly, when the game is this good, does it even matter?\r\n\r\nEven across its 3-5-hour span of standard gameplay, you're not prepared for how this all comes together as well. The shocking ending is bound to stick with you, leaving you simultaneously triumphant and disturbed. Playdead are quite simply the best in the business when it comes to this genre, and INSIDE demands to be played by anyone that's not afraid to leave a few scars on their psyche.",

It is not the best game I've ever played in this genre (which is by far), this could be the best game I've ever played, didn't have the time to compare what I've experienced and how it made me feel playing this for the first time vs other master pieces in my life.\n\nI had Limbo in my library for over a year I think and yesterday after finishing Machinarium (another great game 7/10) I remembered not ever playing Limbo, of which I had very high expectation. So I finished Limbo and found it to be a good game, which lacked in the story telling department quite a bit, but the graphics and the atmosphere made it good - 7.5/10.\n\nThen I saw that Playdead did another game that I have never heard of before. I knew about Limbo, but not about Inside. Luckily it had a demo and I thought let's give it a chance. After playing 30 minutes of the demo which I liked quite a bit, I bought the on sale and continued playing it.\n\nI played all night long to finish it cause I just couldn't stop till I knew how the story ends. The story telling is pure brilliance, how can you tell such an amazing story with no words? It is just mind blowing how other devs write so many characters with tons of dialogue and still can't make you feel something and Playdead managed this level of story telling without a line...  \n\nThis might be the best game I've ever played and it was 2$ on Steam. I already finished it again today which I almost never do. By the way, I don't think I've played 10 2D/2.5D platformers in my life and now a game from this genre might just be the best game I've ever played in my life. This is for sure 10/10 for me, thank you Playdead, hope you are working on your next 10/10 game, can't wait to play it!",

That means beer, wine, cocktails, snacks, etc. are all a welcomed accompaniment. While that may be a turn-off for those looking for a more tactile-m&k skill based experience, that is not the point of this game. You're thrown into a strange, eerie, and melancholy world as a defenseless yet clever young boy, with danger lurking around every corner. You have nothing but wit and problem solving as your tools of advancing through to the next stages of the game. The puzzles were challenging enough, without taking too long to solve. The sounds in this game are simple awesome, creating the right amount of tension, peacefulness, & awareness for each given scenario. There's only been a handful of simple games like this that I've played that were able to convey so much in such a short amount of time, Outer Wilds is similar one that comes to mind. It was a fairly shorter play through, taking me about 5 hours to complete in 3 sittings. One of the cooler aspects of this game is the world it's set in posses many questions, and the ending... leaves you with even more. 10/10",

It's short and it feels like an experience. It is a good recommendation. Inside is a game that's hard to forget. It doesn't just entertain but also makes you think. It's perfect for those who appreciate deep, atmospheric stories where what's left unsaid is more important than what's explicitly shown.\n ",

You feel for the character you control and for everyone else around him that has shared in basically the same fate. It's from the creator of LIMBO and it really shows. If you loved LIMBO, or even just liked it, I strongly recommend playing this. It's definitely an experience!",

Sometimes the simplest puzzles will take you about 10-15 minutes to figure out if you're not focused. Finishing the puzzles and finding secrets is a really pleasant and rewarding experience.\r\n\r\n10/10 will definitely play again sometime",

It is not scary at all and it has a great storyline. It took me about 3.5 to 4 hours to play thought it. Would recommend buying it on sale, but wouldn't spend 20 bucks on it. Amazing indie game though if you are able to obtain it for fairly cheap :)",

        "review": "I really enjoyed watching this game when I was younger so when I saw it was on sale I thought it was an excellent chance to finally play it myself, especially since I forgot most of it when i watched it. for the first hour I was very engaged and tense a lot of the time. It was fun to sneak and try not to get caught. But as the game wore on I got less and less excited for each puzzle. Now I do like puzzles games, but this game just felt so lifeless and all the time walking around to solve it bored me. The visuals and sound design in this game is very beautiful but I wish it had more horror to break up the long time walking or swimming place to place, after the first hour I never felt tense again. I also couldn't bring myself to care about the story or the faceless character. In the end I simply got tired of the puzzles and realized I wasnt having fun playing anymore and should move on and not waste my limited time to play games. I really wish I liked this game since I love platformers and I'm interested in horror but it just wasent it for me....and for 20 dollars and a average run time of 5 hours max I cant recommend it. Get it on sale if your interested but in my ophinon your not missing much. Glad I got it on sale lol.",

It's more than just a platformer; it's an interactive experience that immerses you in a bleak, alienated world where every step induces anxiety and makes you feel genuine danger.\n\nThe story is told without words, and this is one of those cases where less is more. No dialogues, no explanations—just you, the boy, and this world that seems to be crafted from the darkest corners of human imagination. You quickly realize that in this world, you are just a small part of something much bigger, sinister, and incomprehensible.\n\nThe gameplay in Inside is simple but expertly designed. The puzzles are well-integrated into the gameplay, and none of them feel artificial. They make the game feel rich, and each solution brings a sense of relief, but also a new wave of fear—what's next?\n\nThe game's visual design is a masterpiece on its own. Each scene is a painting where shadows play the leading role. Just a few colors, but they are used so masterfully that they convey more emotions than dozens of details. The atmosphere is created not only through graphics but also through sound design. Silence, punctuated by eerie sounds and rare musical accents, creates a sense of complete isolation.\n\nThe game's ending is a story in itself. It leaves more questions than answers, making you ponder what you've just experienced. It's the kind of ending that makes you want to discuss it with others, searching for meaning and clues.\n\nInside is a game that's hard to forget. It doesn't just entertain but also makes you think. It's perfect for those who appreciate deep, atmospheric stories where what's left unsaid is more important than what's explicitly shown.",

Puzzles aren't really too difficult but there isn't any story or explanation for what is happening and the ending is abrupt and no questions are answered, the credits just roll and that's it. Got it at 90% discount and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. No replay value other than maybe the collectables and a secret ending that doesn't explain anything either. So I would recommend this game, but not at the full price.",

At its core, the game is very simplistic with its minimal controls and game settings, but that does not detract from the extraordinary experience the game has to offer.\r\n\r\nWith its fantastic visuals and sound design, Inside is atmospheric, immersive, and captivating. The attention to detail is simply incredible.\r\n\r\nThe puzzles are great and do not hinder the flow and tempo of the game. I put that down to the animations and controls, which are 100% on point.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that both endings leave a lot to be desired, but personally, I found them to be very intriguing and eerie, which encapsulates the dark, atmospheric world that has been created.\r\n\r\nThe game doesn't take long to finish, but the experience is definitely worth it.\r\n\r\nVerdict: 9/10. A masterpiece!",

While i had suspicions that the game might not be worth playing, the game had very unique puzzles, they weren't hard but took some time figuring out how you're supposed to advance to the next stage and it was very satisfying doing so. I wouldn't recommend spending 20$ on it but it's definitely worth buying when it's on discount. Cheers.",

You play as a kid(?) who is trying to escape some kidnappers, scientist, dogs and [spoiler]shadow creatures[/spoiler]. The game takes you through forests, laboratories, farms and has a wide variety of vastly different environments. It's a lot better than it's counterpart, LIMBO.",

        "review": "Inside, from the creators of Limbo, has always held a special place in my gaming history. Playing it when I was younger left a lasting impression, and revisiting it now only deepens my appreciation for its artistry and storytelling. The game remains a testament to how a minimalist approach can result in an incredibly profound experience.\n\nGameplay and Atmosphere:\nInside is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling and environmental design. From the very start, the game draws you into a dystopian world with its hauntingly silent and oppressive ambiance. The gameplay is straightforward yet deeply engaging, with a focus on puzzle-platforming and exploration. Each segment of the game introduces new mechanics and challenges that keep the experience fresh and compelling, all while maintaining a seamless flow.\n\nThe controls are intuitive, allowing you to focus on the atmospheric immersion rather than struggling with clunky mechanics. The puzzles are cleverly designed, requiring a mix of logic and timing, and the sense of tension is ever-present. The minimalist design of the game ensures that every element—from the ominous soundtrack to the eerie sound effects—serves to enhance the overall mood and narrative.\n\nAesthetic Brilliance:\nOne of the standout features of Inside is its aesthetic design. The game’s visual style is both striking and understated. The use of muted colors and shadowy environments creates a sense of foreboding and mystery that perfectly complements the narrative. The detailed and atmospheric backgrounds, combined with the fluid animation of the protagonist, result in a visually stunning experience that remains memorable.\n\nThe game’s environments are meticulously crafted, with each area offering a unique and unsettling atmosphere. The seamless transitions between different settings—from industrial complexes to eerie underwater sections—demonstrate the developers’ keen eye for detail and artistic vision. Inside’s ability to convey so much with so little is a testament to its aesthetic mastery.\n\nNostalgia and Impact:\nPlaying Inside when I was younger was a deeply immersive experience. The game’s haunting atmosphere and enigmatic storytelling left a significant mark, creating memories that have stayed with me. Returning to it now, the nostalgia is palpable. The sense of wonder and unease that accompanied my first playthrough is rekindled, reminding me of why Inside remains such a standout title in my gaming history.\n\nThe emotional impact of the game, combined with its visual and auditory brilliance, ensures that it remains a powerful and evocative experience. It’s a game that continues to resonate, proving that even years later, its artistic and narrative qualities hold up exceptionally well.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nInside is more than just a game; it’s an evocative journey through a meticulously crafted world. Its aesthetic brilliance and haunting atmosphere make it a standout title that continues to captivate and intrigue. The nostalgia of playing it in my younger years, combined with the timeless quality of its design, makes it a memorable and cherished part of my gaming history.\n\nFor anyone who appreciates games that push the boundaries of storytelling and visual design, Inside is an experience that should not be missed. Its ability to evoke strong emotions and leave a lasting impression is a testament to its enduring impact and artistic achievement.",

This game though, is easily one of the greatest things I've ever played and I find its use of backgrounds in the gameplay to be perhaps its strongest feature.\r\n\r\nI might even love it more than Limbo.",

        "review": "It's like that quirky friend who shows up at your party wearing mismatched socks and a neon beanie. It defies conventions, laughs in the face of predictability, and dances to its own glitchy soundtrack. Buckle up, because this game takes you on a wild ride through a digital dreamscape.\n\n🌟 Graphics and Aesthetics: Imagine Salvador Dalí and H.R. Giger collaborating on a pixel art project. The visuals are a kaleidoscope of surreal landscapes, glitchy creatures, and mind-bending puzzles. It’s like your screen dropped acid and decided to trip out.\n\n🎵 Soundtrack: The music? Oh, it’s not just a soundtrack; it’s an auditory wormhole. Synths collide with glitchy beats, creating an otherworldly vibe. You’ll find yourself humming these tunes while waiting in line at the grocery store. Trust me.\n\n🧠 Gameplay: Puzzles? More like brain acrobatics. “Inside the Game” doesn’t hold your hand; it tickles your neurons. You’ll manipulate time, gravity, and existential dread. Just when you think you’ve cracked it, the game smirks and throws a curveball. It’s like playing chess with an AI that quotes Nietzsche.\n\n🤖 Characters: Meet our protagonist, Pixel Pete. He’s a glitchy hero with commitment issues. His sidekick? A sentient toaster named Crispy. Together, they battle existential bugs and unravel the game’s cryptic narrative. Think “The Matrix” meets “Alice in Wonderland.”\n\n🌈 Overall Vibe: “Inside the Game” isn’t just a game; it’s a glitchy love letter to the absurd. It winks at reality, flirts with chaos theory, and whispers, “Hey, player, reality is overrated.” So grab your joystick, sip your digital coffee, and dive into this pixelated rabbit hole. You’ll emerge equal parts enlightened and bewildered.\n\n🎮 Rating: 9/10 (Lost a point because Pixel Pete still owes me 20 virtual bucks.)",

        "review": "This review is based on 100% completion and 3.1 hours of gameplay.\n\n[h1][b]Recommendation:[/b][/h1]\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, it was an interesting experience. Do I understand what is actually going on with the story they are trying to tell? Nope. Was it still very interesting and intriguing? Absolutely. This game gives off strong “Little Nightmares” vibes, so if you enjoyed those games, there's a good chance you'll have a great experience with this one.\n\nI went into this semi-blind, and while I have absolutely no idea what the story that the developers are trying to tell here is, you can make some educated assumptions, which I think adds to the charm of the game. It doesn’t tell you what to do or explicitly how to think—you figure things out yourself. When you boot up the game, it drops you straight in—no title screen, no tutorial, no hand-holding. I'm a bit torn on how to feel about that, but it’s okay.\n\nThe progression is done really well and feels fluid. The environment looks very nice, and the art style is a good choice for this game. The clever use of lighting and colours to guide the player is done very well, and the sound design is nice, complementing the other elements of the game to create a really interesting and tense atmosphere.\n\nThe actual gameplay aspect worked very well for me and was fluid. Everything did what I expected it to, and I didn’t run into any bugs or issues. The puzzle-solving is easy and intuitive, so you won’t get stuck and if you do it won’t be for long, which is nice. It's not so easy that it becomes boring, which is good. The deaths are really interesting, and I wasn't expecting some of them to be so brutal—a pleasant surprise. Even though you may die a lot, the game is very forgiving with its saves/respawns, so you’ll be right next to where you failed, which is really nice.\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant experience with this game and would love to explore the lore more later on. While I enjoyed this, I do not recommend buying this game at the base price—I don’t think the content-to-price ratio is worth it. The game has regular sales, so finding a good deal shouldn’t be too difficult if you can wait. While on sale this is a good pick up.\n\n[h1][b]Achievement:[/b][/h1]\nAll the achievements in this game are tied to finding the disco-looking orbs throughout the game. There’s a good guide by “Brachragon” in the Steam guides [url= https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2147616108] here. [/url] There are no story spoilers, and the guide includes pictures, making it very easy to follow. I recommend following the guide so you can do everything in a single playthrough.\n\nThere are no missable achievements in this game, thanks to the chapter select option in the pause menu. So, if you want to find them all yourself or you miss some, it’s not too difficult to go back. This is a very easy 100%.",

        "review": "I tried Limbo because it had very high scores, but after playing for 2 hours, I didn't like it and stopped. Then, I saw a recommendation on Steam to play Inside by the Limbo developers due to its high scores. Inside boasts an overwhelmingly high score of 96% on Steam, along with a 93/8.3 rating on Metacritic, and it has received numerous awards, including BAFTA and TGA. So I forced myself to play for over 3 hours, nearly finishing the game before deciding to stop. I don’t believe that so many people on Steam and Metacritic could be wrong, yet I absolutely didn’t enjoy the game. Here’s why:\n\n[h3] Scenario 3/10 [/h3]\n\nThe game immediately grabs your interest as you control a boy who jumps down and runs through dangerous, mystic enemies and locations, delving deeper into the dark and mysterious depths of what seems like a dystopian base/city/laboratory. You find yourself asking, \"What is going on?\", \"Who is this boy?\", and \"Why is he doing this?\" Unfortunately, you won’t find any answers, nor will you receive any adequate clues about what is happening. The lack of dialogue, characters, text, or speech means you're left to piece together the plot yourself, which begs the question: what’s the point of playing if you must invent the story? I give 3 points for the beginning, but 0 for both the middle and the ending.\n\n[h3] Visuals 8/10 [/h3]\n\nThe visuals are minimalistic, stylish, and atmospheric, which I must admit is the game's strongest aspect. The camera movements, colors, and locations are all executed brilliantly, creating an intriguing spectacle of dark energy smeared across the screen. Although some areas and units are repetitive, the art team has done an impressive job overall.\n\n[h3] Sound design 4/10 [/h3]\n\nThe game features almost no music, only offering a few brief moments of sound. You spend most of the game listening to footsteps and the sounds of actions and enemies around you. On one hand, this silence enhances the atmosphere, evoking a sense of loneliness and decay. However, on the other hand, it exacerbates the boredom when you're simply running through empty corridors, making the experience even more tedious.\n\n[h3] Gameplay 3/10 [/h3]\n\nDespite being categorized as a puzzle platformer on Steam, the 'platformer' aspect is sparse, with most of the game involving running forward and solving overly simplistic puzzles. There are some moderately difficult puzzles, but their challenge stems only from the unfamiliarity with the objects involved, rather than from inherent puzzle complexity.\n\n[h3] Overall 4/10 [/h3]\n\nInside is an interesting example of a unique visual and narrative style. If you are curious about exploring different aesthetics in games, it’s worth a look. However, if you're seeking challenging puzzles, engaging gameplay, and a compelling plot—as most players do—I cannot recommend this game.",

With a sinister lab full of technicians and their experiments the child must solve puzzles to continue their journey to uncovering the truth of what lies beneath or rather...what lies inside. \r\n\r\nI truly enjoyed the attention to detail in this game. The 2 dimensional feel of movement resembles the play style of \"Limbo\" and \"Little Nightmares\". The graphics are beautifully though out. The soundtrack is both eerie and captivating. \r\n\r\nThe puzzles throughout increase in difficulty but are stimulating and fun! \r\n\r\nFor a smaller game I can tell a lot of love and labor went into its development. I 100% recommend this game for puzzle lovers!",

And the visuals and locations seem to be fairly decent as well as the characters, but the game just left me wanting more. I expected there to be more to the story like LIMBO, where there was some purpose to the adventure, but instead the game was way longer than LIMBO and the puzzles were more complex, yet after all the trouble of getting to the end I never got a chance to understand the \"why\" of this game. The story just ends abruptly and then repeats with no ending cutscene and the collectibles are near impossible to find on some occasions without a guide. And even then, there is no meaning behind these, they're kind of just \"there\". Also the underwater levels really affect the game's pacing as well as the swimming ones, because they really make the game more confusing and lengthy while not being very fun or creative. They're kind of just in the way. It wasn't the worst to grab on sale, but I certainly enjoyed LIMBO more.",

Often times it's so dark that the slightest glare on your screen means you can't see anything at all. Involves zero skill, just learning, as it continually kills you unexpectedly forcing a rinse and repeat style in place of actual game play. At no time does the game inform you of what is going on and it makes no sense, including the ending, which is up there as one of the worst I've ever witnessed. Even the achievements give zero indication of how they should be completed, and it would be a sad existence wasting your time trying to figure them out.\n\nLimbo with all the fun and soul removed.",

INSIDE is great, with a beautiful artsyle, intriguing (if somewhat vague) story, and puzzles that hit that sweet spot of \"not too easy to switch your brain off, not too hard to rage-quit\" (and some interesting secrets for you to go back and look for). \n\nFor people looking for games with a strong, immersive atmosphere and unique experience, INSIDE is must-have.

It's amazing what they've achieved without a single dialogue or cut-scene. Improved upon Limbo on every single aspect of the game, puzzles here are way more logical.

A masterpiece of a game and one of the best examples of games as an art form.\n\nIf you still haven't played this game yet (along with Playdead's other game, \"Limbo\"), then please, play it now and see what you think. It's certainly an experience you'll never forget, and you owe it to yourself if you're into Arty Video Games.",

        "review": "\"Inside,\" developed by Playdead, is a hauntingly beautiful puzzle-platformer that delivers an unforgettable gaming experience. This atmospheric game captures your attention from the very beginning with its strikingly minimalist art style and captivating sound design.\n\nThe game follows a young boy navigating through a dark, dystopian world filled with mystery and danger. The visual storytelling is masterful, using light, shadow, and color to convey emotion and narrative without a single word of dialogue. Each scene is meticulously crafted, immersing players in a bleak yet mesmerizing environment.\n\nGameplay is a seamless blend of platforming and puzzle-solving. The controls are tight and responsive, and the puzzles are cleverly designed, challenging players to think creatively without ever feeling unfair. The sense of progression is perfectly paced, with each new area introducing fresh mechanics and challenges that keep the experience engaging from start to finish.\n\n\"Inside\" excels in creating a sense of tension and suspense, thanks to its eerie atmosphere and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. The sound design enhances the experience, with every footstep, creak, and ambient noise adding to the overall sense of unease.\n\nIn summary, \"Inside\" is a short but impactful game that leaves a lasting impression. Its stunning visuals, atmospheric storytelling, and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of puzzle-platformers and anyone looking for a deeply immersive gaming experience.",

Clever puzzles, not easy, not hard, very entertaining and interesting. I can't recall that I experienced such a joy playing a game previously, when you think that the game won't give anymore surprises, the very next step it disapproves it.\nThe Devs are geniuses, excellent story to think about, level, music and sound designs. Can't wait for the next game from the talented team. \nI had a bucket of emotions playing it. 10/10.",

Certainly worth playing, especially for low price, but there is so much wasted potential in here, with concepts and plots to be introduced and instantly dropped for nothing. \n\nIt's disconnected, as if somebody took random cool premises and tried to combine them together, without doing much to make them stand out besides the initial \"wouldn't it be cool, if X\".\n\nOnly giving it negative, because I disagree with this game being 10/10, as the overall reviews imply. It's a good game. But flawed, both on terms of gameplay and the entire setup it tries to work with.",

This sense of foreboding horror, and the eeriness doesn't leave you, keeps you on the edge, and it's easily one of the more accessible games in terms of gameplay, so always a great gift to folx who want to get into gaming but are always intimidated by the steep learning curves of most games.",

Even though it's short (I finished it in about 3 hours), every moment is packed with incredible qualities. The immersive atmosphere and subtle narrative are captivating.\r\n\r\nWarning: Inside is not for those seeking traditional challenges. With no clear instructions, the game requires you to think and reason on your own. There were times I was completely stuck and had to turn to YouTube for help.\r\n\r\nFor those who are deaf, don't worry. The game has no crucial dialogues. You can play it muted but I recommend keeping the sound on - the soundtrack is simply fantastic.\r\n\r\nInside is an unforgettable adventure that challenges the mind and touches the soul.",

If you are someone who has played games like Limbo, Little Nightmares, etc., I am sure you will love this one as INSIDE has 2 endings and both make some sense and help you to understand the overall plot. \n\nSo yeah definitely go for it if you have patience.",

        "review": "“Inside” isn’t just a game; it’s an enigma wrapped in shadows and silence. Developed by Playdead, this atmospheric puzzle-platformer invites you to step into a world where questions outnumber answers.\n\nEvery frame in “Inside” feels like a brushstroke on a canvas of despair. The monochromatic palette, punctuated by vivid reds, sets an eerie tone.\nThe attention to detail is staggering. Dust motes dance in shafts of light, and raindrops ripple in murky pools. It’s a visual symphony.\nPrepare for stark contrasts—darkness against light, life against decay. The world breathes, and you’re a silent witness.\nMechanically, it’s a 2D platformer, but that’s merely the surface. There are no tutorials, no hand-holding. You’re thrown into the abyss.\nPuzzles emerge organically from the environment. Physics, timing, and intuition guide you. Each solution feels like a revelation.\nThe narrative unfolds wordlessly. You’ll question motives, unravel secrets, and wonder what lies beyond the next door.\n“Inside” doesn’t explain; it evokes. Fear, wonder, and melancholy intertwine. The boy’s journey becomes your own.\nMoments of horror and beauty collide. You’ll feel a knot in your chest, a shiver down your spine. It’s hauntingly intimate.\nThe brevity (about three hours) amplifies the emotional punch. It’s like a fleeting dream—one you’ll remember forever.\n\nConclusion\n“Inside” defies categorization. It’s a cryptic poem, a silent scream, a dance with shadows. Play it. Discuss it. Let it seep into your soul.",

The graphics are great, and the game does a fantastic job at setting the mood of suspense and exploration. It is too short-lived, but it is nonetheless overall entertaining. \r\n\r\nHowever the reason I give this game a thumbs down is that for all its good, it disappoints at the end. The story is fairly consistent until a key point in the game where you begin having a modified ability. This in and of itself isn't that off par with the storyline, but suddenly toward the end things get very weird and very fast. It seems from this development that something very climactic is going to happen, yet the end results in you simply rolling out of a wall and dying - with a tediously slow zoom out before the credits. \r\n\r\nNo explanation, no climax, nothing meaningful. Just a story that was good and suddenly got weird and cuts off abruptly. \r\n\r\nAlso the secrets in this game are fun to find, but their reward is very poor. It takes a good bit of work to unlock the secret, and it is also incredibly un-climactic. You are in a room, pull out a plug and the room goes dark. And that's it. What? After all that work? No extra area to explore? No alternate journey? Nothing? Very disappointing.",

(atleast imo)\r\nThis game isn't really that horror, you pretty much gotta do puzzle and when you dont do puzzle, you just press d and wait until you have to jump or grab lol\r\nFun puzzle, kind of disturbing game\r\n\r\nRating 7/10\r\nEnjoyment 6/10",

        "review": "[b] Inside: A Haunting and Atmospheric Masterpiece [/b]\n\n'Inside' is a haunting and atmospheric platformer that takes players on a dark and enigmatic journey. Developed by Playdead, the creators of the critically acclaimed 'Limbo,' 'Inside' is a testament to the studio's ability to create compelling and emotionally impactful experiences.\n\n[b] Unveiling a Dystopian Nightmare [/b]\n\nThe game follows an anonymous boy who finds himself in a twisted and oppressive world. Players are thrust into a grayscale landscape filled with monstrous creatures, looming structures, and unsettling environments. The game's subtle and minimalist visuals create a palpable sense of unease and dread.\n\n[b] Gripping Gameplay with Emotional Resonance [/b]\n\n'Inside' combines platforming gameplay with puzzle elements that challenge players' wits and reflexes. The controls are simple yet precise, allowing for fluid and immersive movement. Each level presents unique challenges, ranging from navigating treacherous traps to avoiding grotesque enemies.\n\nWhat sets 'Inside' apart is its ability to evoke profound emotions. The game's horrific imagery and unsettling encounters leave a lasting impression on players. The boy's journey becomes a metaphor for our own fears and vulnerabilities, reminding us of the fragility of life and the darkness that lurks within.\n\n[b] Masterful Sound Design [/b]\n\nThe game's sound design is a masterpiece in its own right. Ambient sounds and minimalist music create an eerie and oppressive atmosphere. Every creak, whisper, and heartbeat amplifies the tension and immerses players in the game's unsettling world.\n\n[b] An Unforgettable Experience [/b]\n\n'Inside' is not a game for the faint of heart. It is a challenging, thought-provoking, and ultimately unforgettable experience. Its haunting visuals, gripping gameplay, and emotionally resonant narrative create a masterpiece that will stay with players long after they finish it.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n* Haunting and atmospheric visuals\n* Gripping gameplay that combines platforming and puzzles\n* Profound and emotionally evocative narrative\n* Masterful sound design\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n* May be too intense for some players\n* Lack of explicit storytelling may leave some players confused",

        "review": "ehhhhhhhh....... it's alright. Not for me. \n\nThe game is visually stunning. The sound design was also very good. The themeing was also very nice. That's all this game seems to do for me, however. Despite the atmosphere or themeing being well executed to such a high degree, I often found myself bored, frustrated and confused. There are some neat mechanics, but the puzzles would either be too linear and simple or very open and confusing. And the rest of the gameplay is either running or swimming. The protagonist is not even super fun to control, and is kind of slow. And also, there is SO MUCH SWIMMING! Why? I don't really mind swimming in video games but there is an unnecessary amount of swimming to be done. The only 'side content' this game has to offer are these secret capsule thingies you can find if you explore. There are not that many of these, and based off the ones that I could find, they are either very simple and easy to find or they are incredibly obscure. \n\nThe story is supposedly one of the main parts of this game but it is so open-ended that I could not find much interest in it. It starts out interesting, but then the puzzles and filler start to take over with only little hints of the story sprinkled into certain areas. Then towards the second half of the game the narrative starts to kick in again but this time it starts getting confusing, up until the final act and it ends in a very anti-climactic fashion. The ending makes no sense to me? And there is so little context and background information to theorise anything about it. And what I mean about \"filler\", I mean that there is a lot of travelling in random places, such as overgrown areas or mine shafts or flooded buildings? I am so confused on why we are travelling through these places other than to end up in the final area, which very conveniently happens to be at the end of all that traversing. And the protagonist? Why does he think travelling through such places will work out in the end? Why are we even going to where we are going? How does he know where to... go? And if he doesn't, why are we ending up in such convenient places to meet up with the bad guys? The final act is also... a thing that happens. All the shenanigans that happen in the final act is not explained and is so confusing. Why is everything so damn confusing?!\n\nOverall the game is still well-made. There is clearly a lot of effort that was put into the game, and it offered a neat experience. However based on what I've said above, there is a lot this game does not do well to me. This game is not worth its full price, but this game seems to be going on a lot of big sales so you can try it out and see for yourself.",

I didn't expect such plot twist near the end of the game + the secret ending. I was left with more questions than answers. lol\n\nSome puzzles made me think I'm an idiot for not being able to finish them. But they were enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n7/10\nI didn't regret ever trying and finishing this game. But at the end I realized I was actually not cut out for puzzle games. I do recommend this game for those who like the genre, though. \n\n\n",

Very fun with some frustration with a few puzzle that you just needed to think a slight bit more about!",

        "review": "Atmospheric Brilliance with Unrivaled Gameplay\r\n\r\nInside, from the creators of Limbo, is an atmospheric masterpiece that sets a new benchmark in the indie game scene. The game thrusts players into a hauntingly beautiful yet eerily oppressive world, where every shadow hides a secret and each silence tells a story.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Sound Design: 10/10\r\n\r\nFrom the moment you step into the world of Inside, you're enveloped in a meticulously crafted environment. The game employs a minimalist yet highly detailed art style that accentuates the bleakness of its dystopian setting. The use of light and shadow is nothing short of masterful, creating a sense of depth and tension that few games can match.\r\n\r\nComplementing the visuals is the sound design, which is equally impressive. The absence of a traditional soundtrack heightens the impact of environmental sounds—creaking doors, distant machinery, and the protagonist's footsteps become key elements of the narrative. This auditory experience is crucial in building the game's suspenseful atmosphere.\r\n\r\nGameplay Mechanics: 9/10\r\n\r\nInside excels in delivering a seamless and intuitive gameplay experience. The controls are straightforward, yet the puzzles are anything but simplistic. Each challenge is organically integrated into the environment, requiring players to think creatively and interact with their surroundings in innovative ways. The game's pacing is impeccable, gradually increasing in complexity without ever becoming frustratingly difficult.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features is the fluidity of the protagonist's movements. The animations are smooth and realistic, adding to the immersion and making every action feel consequential. Whether you're sneaking past guards, navigating treacherous terrain, or solving intricate puzzles, the game maintains a relentless grip on your attention.\r\n\r\nNarrative and Atmosphere: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Inside is conveyed through its world rather than traditional storytelling methods. There is no dialogue or text to guide you; instead, the game relies on environmental storytelling to weave its enigmatic tale. This approach encourages players to piece together the story through observation and interpretation, leading to a deeply personal and engaging experience.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is where Inside truly shines. The game's world is both beautiful and disturbing, filled with haunting imagery and unsettling scenarios. The sense of isolation and vulnerability is palpable, creating a constant undercurrent of tension. Every element, from the subdued color palette to the meticulously designed soundscape, contributes to this immersive experience.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nInside is a triumph of atmospheric gameplay, offering a richly crafted world that draws players in and refuses to let go. Its blend of stunning visuals, masterful sound design, and intelligent puzzle mechanics make it a standout title in the indie gaming landscape. For those seeking a game that challenges the mind while captivating the senses, Inside is an absolute must-play.\r\n\r\nOverall Score: 9.5/10",

While I think it's brilliant to keep the details behind this disturbing world under wraps at first, I would have liked more definitive explanations of lore by the end (even if the ending itself was left up to interpretation). It's clear that in the end the journey was meant to be fruitless, but without a real specific explanation as to what horrible things the bad guys were doing and what their goal was (other than \"mind control, duh\") it is difficult to care. I also personally didn't enjoy the underwater sections which unfortunately makes up most of the last half. \r\n\r\nThe visuals are great, the game is a good length for an indie, and the tone of the game is spot on. I can't say I would necessarily recommend it unless it was a specific person who was a fan of LIMBO or really enjoyed environmental puzzle games. Overall, it left me feeling meh.",

I finished it a year ago and revisited it today, saw that I forgot to write a review for this game so here it is. Amazing visuals and a nice & clean art-style with a great soundtrack that really creates this thick atmosphere and brings this game to perfection. It's ambient, dark, intense (and a little bit disgusting sometimes) but overall a genuinely well made short story puzzle game where you not just piece together how to go further in the game but also the very story itself. \n\nSpiritual successor to LIMBO, another indie puzzle gem from the same developers(Playdead), would highly recommend the bundle (LIMBO+Inside) on sale, definitely worth it. Though the puzzles this time are easier and more doable (took me 8 hours to complete the game and get all the achievements, worth it as you'll encounter some easter eggs and more depth in the narrative). It's a short enthralling experience that you'll remember for a long time :) ... 10/10\n\nEdit - Just finished the replay of the game. Honestly I wanted to just revisit the game but didn't know I'd replay and finish it again. I seldom replay (few titles that deserve it) so yeah this kept me enthralled once again. Great game!",

Inside instantly grabbed my attention, and kept me hook the entire time. I'm struggling to find anything wrong with the game. It's genuinely perfect, and already consider it to be among my top gaming experiences. \r\n\r\nObviously the games strongest pro is the sound design and ambience. It's definitely some of the best sound design in any game I've ever played. The chilling images that foreshadow what is to proceed is done expertly, and has some of the best use of a flat art style I've seen. The way the camera works is amazing and loved the wide shots that would make you look insanely small. How the story reveals its self is great due to the perfect pacing of the game. Inside introduces new mechanics just before the previous ones get old. Seriously I don't think I've seen better pacing since I first played Half-Life 2. Another part of the excellent pacing is the puzzles, which are beyond creative. I love how majority of the puzzles happen when your in danger, which adds a new level of intensity making the puzzles engaging. The constant close calls are what really set the present danger, and cause genuine fear.\r\n\r\n The ending was unexpected, and I thought by the end the game revealed just the right amount information, to open room for theories. The way I interpret it is like most but I have a few things I add that might be different. For the sake of spoilers I won't say anything. There is so much more I can say in detail. However, it would ruin the magic. You just have to play it for yourself, so you can see the brilliance of Playdead's Inside.",

The puzzles are not too tough but challenging enough to be rewarding.  The world is very interesting and tells a story without the use of dialog.  The controls are intuitive.  The use of lighting is incredible. Play this game on an OLED if you can to get the most out of the use of shadows and light in the game.  Highly recommend this game and hoping Playdead releases another game in the future.",

Despite the seriousness and darkness of the ideas evoked in a subtle way throughout a wordless story, we remain caught up until the last minute by the disturbing subject as well as by the skillfully paced gameplay. No sequence or puzzle is left to chance, the attention to detail is admirable and we have a good, somewhat hidden reason to redo the game right away, if not just for fun. A real success which deserves to feature very prominently in your game library.",

It sucked me right into its surreal universe, where every frame felt meticulously crafted. Seriously, it was like a feast for the eyes, and I couldn't look away!\n\nLet's talk puzzles, shall we? Inside knows how to challenge your brain cells. These puzzles were no joke, my friends. They required some serious out-of-the-box thinking and problem-solving skills. It was like the developers were playing a game of \"how to drive players insane with mind-bending challenges.\" But hey, that's what made it so damn satisfying when you finally cracked those brain-busters!\n\nNow, the story. Oh boy, the story! Inside had this enigmatic vibe that kept me hooked from start to finish. It was like an interactive mystery novel where you're left to unravel the secrets of this bizarre world all on your own. The lack of explicit explanations only added to the intrigue. Trust me, you'll be left with more questions than answers, and that's part of the magic!\n\nSound design? A+. The audio team nailed it! The atmospheric sounds and haunting music created an immersive experience that sent shivers down my spine. It was like being trapped in a suspenseful thriller, where every creak and whisper heightened the tension. Major props to the sound wizards behind this masterpiece!\n\nNow, let's address the length. Inside may not be the longest game out there, but it's all about quality over quantity, my friends. The developers knew how to make every minute count. The pacing was spot-on, keeping the intensity high and the momentum rolling. Plus, the replayability factor with hidden secrets and alternate paths adds extra value and extends the enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a gamer seeking an unforgettable journey, Inside is a must-play. The mind-blowing visuals, brain-teasing puzzles, mysterious narrative, and immersive sound design combine to create an epic gaming experience.",

I first played INSIDE on my iPhone and loved it. The story is quite short, and replayability simply doesn't exist (aside from replaying the story), but the story makes up for it. There are no words or text, so the story is only a guideline for the player to interpret how they please. I've seen plenty of YouTube videos \"explaining\" the story of INSIDE, and all of them are different. That's what I love about this game. You truly get whatever you want from it. The lack of replayability is also made up for by the small price tag. I'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone. Very simple gameplay mechanics and fun to play. I've bought this game for myself and a few friends.",

        "review": "Inside is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece that defies conventional gaming norms to deliver an unforgettable experience. Developed by Playdead, the creators of Limbo, this game takes players on a journey through a surreal and dystopian world where every moment is filled with tension and intrigue.\n\nSimilar to Limbo, game-play in Inside is minimalist yet incredibly immersive. Players control a young boy navigating through a series of puzzles and obstacles, all while uncovering the dark secrets of the world around him. The puzzles are cleverly designed, often requiring a blend of logical thinking and precise timing. The simplicity of controls enhances the experience, allowing the focus to remain on the unfolding narrative and atmospheric tension.\n\n****Spoiler alert for those who haven't played Inside.\n\nThe conclusion of Inside is deliberately enigmatic and open to interpretation, leaving players with more questions than concrete answers. As the game progresses, players guide the protagonist through increasingly surreal and ominous environments, encountering strange experiments and mind-control devices along the way. The ultimate goal seems to be breaking free from this oppressive world.\n\nIn the climactic final sequence, the boy (controlled by the player) reaches the heart of a facility where a massive blob-like creature is suspended. By using mind-control helmets, the player commands a horde of mindless humanoids to connect to the blob, forming a grotesque human chain. The boy, instead of joining this chain, disconnects the blob from its life-support system, causing it to burst through the facility and roll downhill, ultimately crashing into a body of water.\n\nThe boy seemingly merges with the blob, gaining control of its abilities. The game then continues with the boy now in control of the blob, able to breathe underwater and swim away. This ending implies a form of rebirth or transformation, suggesting that the protagonist has transcended the constraints of his former existence.\n\nWhile the alternate ending, after collecting all the orbs, show a hidden mind control switch. Upon activating the switch, the boy collapses to the ground, motionless. The screen fades to black, leaving players to ponder the implications of this unexpected turn of events. This ending adds a layer of intrigue and mystery to the game's narrative, raising questions about the nature of the boy, the purpose of the mind-control devices, and the true intentions of the game's antagonistic forces. \n\nIn conclusion, Inside is a must-play for anyone seeking a thought-provoking and visually striking gaming experience. It challenges the boundaries of storytelling in gaming and leaves a lasting impression that few games can match. Whether you're a fan of puzzle-platformers or narrative-driven games, Inside offers an unforgettable journey into the unknown.",

From the physical effects and sound design to the camera work in the 2.5D scenes and the masterful control of the player's emotions, every aspect is executed with high proficiency. The hints provided through lighting and camera movements strike the perfect balance, guiding without overwhelming. The mechanical equipment is designed with both realism and functionality in mind, impressively so. It's astonishing how a variety of puzzles have been ingeniously crafted using just a few basic modules. The characters evoke empathy.\nComplete the game in 5.5 hours, unlocking 5/14 achievements. Rumor has it that there's a better ending awaiting those who earn all the achievements, so I'm definitely going to achieve that.",

        "review": "\"Inside\" is a masterful piece of interactive storytelling and atmospheric puzzle-platforming. Developed by Playdead, the creators of \"Limbo,\" this game takes players on a haunting journey through a dystopian world filled with mystery and danger.\n\nOne of the game's most striking features is its visual design. The art direction is impeccable, using a muted color palette and minimalist style to create a sense of foreboding and intrigue. Every scene is meticulously crafted, with detailed backgrounds and fluid animations that enhance the immersive experience.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Inside\" is both challenging and rewarding. The puzzles are cleverly designed, requiring players to think critically and experiment with their environment. The controls are intuitive and responsive, making the platforming segments feel smooth and satisfying. As you progress, the game introduces new mechanics and obstacles that keep the experience fresh and engaging.\n\nThe narrative of \"Inside\" is subtle yet powerful. Without a single line of dialogue, the game tells a compelling story through its environments, character actions, and eerie atmosphere. This approach allows players to interpret the story in their own way, adding to the game's depth and replayability.\n\nThe sound design and musical score further enhance the game's unsettling mood. The sparse use of sound effects and ambient noise creates an oppressive atmosphere, while the music underscores the tension and mystery of the world.\n\n\"Inside\" is a short but unforgettable experience that leaves a lasting impact. Its combination of striking visuals, engaging gameplay, and thought-provoking storytelling makes it a standout title in the indie game scene. Playdead has crafted a game that is as beautiful as it is haunting, and it is a must-play for fans of atmospheric and narrative-driven games.",

        "review": "Inside is a perfect example of developers taking a beautifully executed concept like Limbo and elevating it in simple and extremely effective ways. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if it was because I was already familiar with the game mechanics of Limbo that Inside's puzzles felt easier, but I wouldn't necessary say that's a bad thing. I never felt frustrated with Inside the way I felt with Limbo at times. Instead I was able to focus more on the atmosphere and art/sound design that was beautiful and haunting.  There's something surreal about being dropped right in the middle of a story and enjoying how they peel back layer after layer of the world around you.\r\n\r\nI am incredibly glad I was never spoiled for the ending of this game. I could see how some people might find it divisive, but I personally love games that allow room for interpretation as a creative art piece. I'm definitely here for whatever Playdead has up their sleeves in the future.",

This time around however, there is much more to pick apart in terms of lore/storytelling, and much like Little Nightmares it wants to tell you something about our world just as much as it does the world of the game. This ties into my one critique however, as the game sacrifices gameplay for set pieces, as sometimes there really isn't a puzzle they're just showing you a cool room or making you walk in a single file line. And while there is artistic merit in the look, meaning, and atmosphere, the themes are too passé to warrant how seriously it takes itself. \r\nYou can pull things, [i]and[/i] push things?! 9/10",

        "review": "Some games don't hit, and that's probably my case with INSIDE. I had a better time playing LIMBO for sure.\n\nThe atmosphere, storytelling and visuals were nice... In the first two thirds. After that, it's all the same industrial-scientific-lab and the worst thing by far is the [b] HUGE AMONT OF WATER SEQUENCES [/b]. I swear, it became so often that whenever the game pushes me to take a swim i was like [i] \"For fuck's sacke dude, really? AGAIN?\" [/i]. I usually don't have problems with \"Water levels\" on games, and INSIDE, when dosed, have some really good and interesting mechanics exploring them, but theres A LOT of swimming simulator too.\n\nAbout the puzzles. They were much easier than in LIMBO, but that's not really a issue for my. I found INSIDE [u] lacking specially [/u] in puzzles, with always more or less the same mechanics and they took longer to physically execute than it did to mentally solve. It usually was consisting of a 3 part puzzle, activating something, going back to activate something else and then finally going back again to activate something else and proceed. Or scenarios like this: there is a part where some hounds are chasing you, and you have climb back and forth over the same fence multiple times to escape.\n\nLike i said, about completing ~60% of the game, i got bored. I was anxious to see a different scenario besides the gray industral complex or polluted water. Or some actual development in the story. I know, LIMBO follow the same pattern: scenarios don't drastically change and you don't get any clue until the end. The difference is, there's more memorable moments, puzzles and enemies in LIMBO. Here, the only \"outstanding\" thing is the mermaid or whatever the fuck is that copy of the girl from The Ring and all the mind control / evil lab backstory. About the ending i don't have much to say, because i already expected something vague coming from Playdead and that's cool. \n",

        "review": "Inside. A game that unravels the darkest corridors of the human psyche, much like exploring the depths of one's soul. The creators of \"Limbo\" have crafted a masterful narrative, woven with eerie silence and oppressive atmosphere, pulling you deeper into a hauntingly beautiful world. The protagonist's journey, shrouded in mystery, resonates with a profound sense of inevitability and existential dread. The puzzles are not mere obstacles but reflections of the intricate and often sinister machinations of the world around us.\n\nInside is an experience, not just a game. It captures the essence of what it means to be alone in a world that is as captivating as it is terrifying. Every step taken, every shadow encountered, brings a sense of dread and fascination that is hard to escape. It is a chilling reminder of the darkness that can reside within and the external forces that shape our existence.\n\nIn its bleak and somber narrative, Inside finds beauty, much like the complexities of the human condition. It is a journey worth taking, for it lingers in the mind long after the final scene fades. Truly, another masterpiece from same authors and develeopers which I cannot say any negatives or minuses.",

The graphic design is beautifully minimal and reminds me so much of Limbo, but in colour...I think you could notice some of the elements and inspiration drawn from the legendary Another World too. In a nutshell you could sum it up as a classic \"2.5D puzzle platformer\" with a mysterious storytelling and outstanding, stylised visuals.\n[h3]What's good:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] beautiful visual style and sound design\n[*] masterful storytelling (but I guess it might not work well for some as nothing really gets explained here - so [b]if you look for answers, please note that you will find NONE[/b])\n[*] puzzles which are prefectly and seamlessly integreated into the gameplay and story\n[/list]\n[h3]What's bad:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] I really can't think of anything in particular here. You might say that this is not an extensive game that can be finished in one sitting... The 6.2 hrs of playtine recorded on my account for this game includes some exploration while looking for hidden areas and just enjoyng the view - is that a weak point? ;-)\n[/list]\n[h3]Overall[/h3] \nINSIDE is an outstanding and unique experience that is absolutely worth its asking price. In case you enjoyed the game and are reading this, and by some reason have not heard of [b]Limbo[/b] then please try it! :-)",

While not as difficult as their previous one [i]Limbo[/i] this definitely has a grittier and more dystopian feel to it.\nThe puzzles have evolved slightly with new elements to it like controlling mindless in order to open the path forward for your character. There are also new environments as you’re now able to swim and control a submarine which gives this side-scroller a needed change in scenery and gameplay.\nThe story itself is a bit weird to unravel, but the bits that are there are beautifully told through the environment and player interactions. Also, there’s a secret ending after having found all the collectibles!\nWhile it is definitely a shorter and easier experience than [i]Limbo[/i] all in all, I still enjoyed my time with this game!\n\n[u]Achievements[/u]\nInside has a total of 14 achievements which are all easily obtained by finding and interacting with 14 collectibles hidden throughout the game. After finding all of them you can even achieve a secret ending to the story. With a guide it’s a very easy 100%!\n\n[b]Note:[/b] The Demo to this game also boasts 14 total achievements which are the main game ones just copy pasted. Surprisingly, after having bought the full game, the demo also lets you play through the entire game, and you can unlock all 14 achievements in the same way again!",

Beautiful awe-inspiring atmospheric puzzle game with hints of philosophical themes and considerations.\n\nPros:\n- Despite having no parts of the story (if there is any) written or spoken, game provides enjoyable (if fleeting) sense of discovery\n- Visually simple, yet effective use of lighting, scale and ambience conveys emotions and atmosphere of the game masterfully\n- Definitive art piece\n\nCons:\n- Can't think of any",

The game design is simple but I feel like it lends to the eerie, dark atmosphere. The story is left open for interpretation but I feel like the player can pick up on it pretty easily. Overall, I'd totally recommend this game.",

        "review": "My time with Inside may have been brief, but it certainly left a positive impression. As a 2.5D platform game, the aim was to progress from left to right into increasingly dangerous terrain, with various obstacles to overcome. The puzzles were physics based and the story largely ambiguous, depending on the setting to tell a wordless narrative. I was invested for its entirety, absorbing the dread that mounted from the beginning. The whole package was a pleasure to sit through, the scares more quiet and subtle as opposed to aggressive—parasitic worms, murderous sirens and a grand finale of body horror that came as a delightful surprise.\nAs far as indie games go with hits and misses, this one I'd consider a gem that didn't overstay its welcome, but rather offered a few hours of immaculately designed gameplay.",

Anlatısı özgürlüğü sorgulatıyor. Ne kadar özgürüz dedirtiyor. Bir çiftlikteki solucan mıyız yoksa gerçekten de özgür müyüz? Bulmacalı platform ögeleri çok yerinde. Oyunun fizikleri de güzel çalışıyor. Çok fazla IQ istemiyor bulmacaları. Bir-iki tanesinde zorlanmıştım.",

The oppressive atmosphere and minimalist design draw players into a gripping, unsettling experience. There are people out to get you, and you must escape them, creating a constant sense of tension. Even in the calmest moments, INSIDE manages to keep the player on edge, with the feeling that something could go awry at any moment. Although the game is relatively short, its impactful storytelling and haunting visuals make it a memorable experience that players won't easily forget anytime soon.",

No dialogue is spoken, and yet the world has been crafted in such a unique way, there is never a need for someone to explain what is happening. Supporting the story is the amazing artstyle and visual symbolism of the game - even though quite simple - proves to be terrifyingly beautiful, from rainy corn fields to industrial sci-fi scenes. The soundtrack is great, but what really deserves attention is the stellar sound design this game has. There is one moment in particular which has a sound that still gives me goosebumps to this day. All in all, this game will keep you on edge all the way through its playtime, and even though it is somewhat short, still accomplishes so much with so little.",

Someone has reccomended it to me coz I love \"Little Nightmares\".\n\nIt has collectibles, 2 endings (I only seen the normal ending), the puzzles were pretty creative and made the game feel varied. \n\nMy mixed feelings come from the world and the vague story. I wasn't too blow away, but maybe my opinion will change if I ever decide to do a 2nd playthrough. \n\nIt was still alright and I would reccomend it to people looking for a short, complete experiance that doesn't take long to 100%. The difficulty is fairly balanced so it provides a decent experiance. \n",

Encountering obstacles alone, the character explores the environment by overcoming dangers. The sounds used in the game also adapt to the atmosphere. \n\nIn the game, the character tries to escape from invisible beings, long-haired monsters in the water, dog attacks and various explosions. In the game, we can control the brains of zombies whose brains have been removed by connecting them to our own brains with a device. In some parts, our character has to imitate zombies. As far as I understand in the story of the game, an experiment is being carried out on humans. At the beginning of the game there were many dead pigs on the ground. I guess experiments were done on pigs, then it was time for humans. I'm not sure what kind of experimentation was done in the game. I liked how the game made the player actively think. It is enjoyable to be able to manage the character according to the environment and make the character progress by making the right decisions. The challenges in the game are cleverly arranged and they become increasingly difficult to overcome as the game progresses. Although the game is quite enjoyable, there are things I can criticize. \n\nThe game is short. I didn't understand why the monster coming out of the water was trying to kill the character. I didn't understand why the unseen beings were attacking the character or why the dogs were trying to kill the character.\n\n I didn't like that it was unclear what the character was running from and what exactly the story of the game was. It is a cleverly designed game with its atmosphere, puzzles and visuals. I enjoyed playing. Those who enjoy playing atmospheric puzzle games may prefer it.",

        "review": "Disclaimer; I finished the game in one sitting, without looking anything up and it's now almost 2 AM and I have work at 7 in the morning, so it's been quite a night!\n\nOverall verdict: A decent game that overstays its welcome.\n\nThe puzzles with the exception of 1 or 2 timing-based ones, pretty much solve themselves.\nI would like to say the story seems decent, except there is none.\n\nMuch like Limbo, a lot is left to interpretation, except the problem with Inside is that it is too ambitious.\nThere are various themes of adulthood, losing of self, the great chain, capitalism, loss of innocence and in general, society throughout the entire game.\n\nThe issue is that at some point it loses its focus and you lose track of what it wants to be.\nAnd then once you go back and put pieces together, you realize that the story started at a crazy point, with lots of questions and no answers, and as it goes on, there are only more questions added and by the very end, you have exactly 0 answers!\n\nWhile it was just barely cohesive in the sense of its themes, it loses all of that past a certain point towards the last third of the game, where a sort of \"transition happens\".\n\nWhat made Limbo work - despite what a lot of people here seem to be implying against for some reason!? - was that it never lost its cohesion.\nYou start with a lot of questions but by the end, you can have a general answer for yourself as to what just happened.\n\nIt's not trying to convey a message or social commentary on anything, it's very very straight forward.\nAnd the ending for Limbo simply just works, where the ending for Inside is one big floppy mess which if you play through, you know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nWhere Limbo had the sense of rising tension towards the end and by the time you finally make it, your heart is about to explode, it ends with a certain bitter-sweet cathartic end that puts things into perspective.\n\nWith Inside, you start the game in a lot of mystery, keep going and get more and more curious, then past the midpoint you start to feel the strain but still want to push through the end, and when something very very horrific happens towards the end, you can not wait to just finish and get it over with, and once you DO reach the very end, you just sit there, mashing your buttons and asking \"wait, that was IT!?\"\n\nAnother key thing is the players ability to integrate into the environment. \n\nPart of what made Limbo so great was that it didn’t ever make sense until the last few seconds. \nYou never walk through the environment and say “oh, yeah, I get it, that’s normal!”\nIt never stops being messed up and it continues to be shocking. \n\nWith Inside, it works the same way during the first half. \nNothing makes sense and you proceed through with the same sense of curiosity, looking for answers. \nBut then it starts losing its focus as time goes on and it only gets worse towards the ending. \n\nUnlike Limbo, nothing ever starts making sense and it won’t by the time it ends either. \nThe result is that you’re now accustomed to the absurdity and therefore, desensitized to it, to the point that you stop questioning it. \n\nThere is no logic; never was and never will be, unless you go with a literal Limbo logic which just doesn’t work here. \n\nYou could make it work if you introduced it right as the very “watery transition” happens, marking everything before that point the twisted unsolved reality while eveything after is the beyond, but it’s still just lazy and not fleshed out. \n\n\nIn regards to the game play, I'd say it's mechanically MILES ahead of Limbo in just about every way.\nThe physics of everything is designed so unique that even by the time you finish the game, you'll still continue to be surprised by a new physics-based mechanic that you just discovered.\n\nAlthough what Limbo had going for it was its simplicity.\nEnough that I can come back to it after 4 years and play through every bit like it was yesterday that I played it, and it all just works the way you expect it to, the way you know it should!\n\n\nHere's what I think; towards the last third of the game at the beach with the giant door, I get a sense of overwhelming excitement and an anxious expectation of the unknown; of what awaited me behind that door and how things could end.\n\nIt would've been the perfect ending to the game; beyond the great gate, the overwhelming sound of inexplicable horror, something unfathomable, vague yet not unfamiliar, something primal!\n\nAnd my expectation was subsequently not met as the game goes on for a while, and I mean A WHILE after that and there are so many changes in the theme and atmosphere that all that sense of excitement and anxiety I had were long gone by the time it ended.\n\nI suppose they didn't want to end it like Limbo, with a fantastic build-up and a big bang.\nRather it ends with a big meaty flap, right when you don't expect it, and it's... meaningless!\nJust like us, here, now, me writing this at 2 AM on an exhausted brain and you who just read all of this... for what?\n\nYeah, just go play it!",

I like the zero narration in this game because it leaves the player to decide what the story is about. I like that open interpretation. The atmosphere, music and aesthetic too are just engrossing too and pull you into that narrative. The ending though...left me disturbed.",

The first time I played it I was unnerved the rest of the day, it truly stays in your mind. INSIDE has roughly the same vibe as little nightmare, though it enters it's own category of strange as the game progresses. I had to play it again to unlock another ending, even though it was my second time playing, I still got the same uneasy feeling I got the first time.\r\n\r\nI wish this game was more well known, it deserves more recognition, I've never had an ending to a game that made me lean back in my chair with a face of pure horror while staring off into nothingness just thinking about what the hell I just played. Worth every cent, worth every minute, please play INSIDE.",

It was nice to see what the devs could do with very few mechanics over the course of 3.5 hours. The most interesting mechanic is when your character puts on a mind control helmet that lets you control the sheeple nearby. And you have to move them to solve puzzles. \r\n\r\nI struggled with some of the puzzles, but only because I thought the devs were trying to do something cooler than they actually were. For instance, one puzzle involves pushing a button while some giant storage silos fall and roll down a ramp toward you. At one point in the roll down, one of the silos bounces and its door flings open. I thought you had to time it such that you jump into the silo, and roll down with it. But you don't. If you try that you just die. What you have to do is just run really fast and jump down into the water below the ramp. Idk I thought it would've been cooler to jump into the bin rather than just run away. \r\n\r\nThere isn't really a story to the game, but there is a twist toward the end that's hilarious. I played the game while travelling in 3 sittings and it was great for that. But again, this is not going to change your life. It's just not that kind of game.",

Every dog bark, every musical change, every closed doorway had my hairs standing on edge.

I found this game super fun to play through because of the tense moments and cool secrets the game had to offer. The puzzles were well thought out and always felt fresh. I played though the game once for fun, a second time to get all the achievements I missed and a third time to unlock the secret vault in the corn fields. The secret vault in the corn fields can be unlocked after completing the game once. The code to the vault is:\nUp, Up, Right, Left, Right, Right, Up, Up, Up, Right, Left, Left, Left\nPlease let me know if the code doesn't work and I will edit it.\nOverall a great game that you have to play, I loved it.",

If you consider yourself in that same regard, don’t be afraid of this game. I found the degree of puzzle solving required to be about just right for me.\r\n\r\nMy only real criticism of the game is that some of the obstacles you have to overcome are really more tests of your skills with your controller and sense of timing than they are puzzles. Sort of like “OK, pretty apparent what I have to do. I guess I’ll just have to try it 10 or 15 times before I get it right.” I guess coming to realize that’s the situation you’re in might be a bit of a puzzle in itself though.\r\n\r\nOverall though, that was a relatively small price to pay when it was encountered and was more than made up for by the stunning visuals and other positive qualities of the game.\r\n\r\nRecommended.",

It presents plenty of questions through beautiful set pieces and high tension moments. I didn't expect body horror going into this game, but they did it justice. \n\nIt's not perfect, of course. There are some moments of jank but it didn't have the tediousness that came with LIMBO. The puzzles aren't obtuse and the none stayed for longer than necessary, which kept them from becoming annoying.\n\nOverall, a great game. Glad I played this after LIMBO or else LIMBO would have been even more of a shitshow for me.",

Indeed, this allows for way more background storytelling and makes puzzles a lot clearer, so you do have a fair chance of getting any given one of them on your first try. Mission accomplished - it's not just an experience, but an equally enjoyable and impactful one to boot. The atmosphere is impeccable and particularly the character animations are spectacular.\n\nAs for the game's plot: I'm sorry, [i]what?[/i]",

        "review": "Got this whilst its was on sale for just over £1, best big one I've ever spent. took just over 3 hours to finish and another hour and bit achievement hunting after finishing it once. It's a short and sweet game, you can probably finish it in just one sitting, but it was very impressive the places it took me in those 3 hours. It's akin to Little Nightmares in both gameplay and atmosphere, managing to keep you on edge with some very tense moments and also giving you some breaks in beautifully designed areas to just soak in all the atmosphere. A few moments really stuck with me; namely the decent with the mer-person and, most notably, the Pulse section having some of if not the best sound design I've ever heard in a game with a great build up hearing it get louder and louder from a few areas away, as well as some some wonderful music, which is sparsely used in this game only saving it for key moments.  \n\nOverall an absolute hidden gem of a game that doesn't overstay its welcome. Amazing art direction, a confusing world that feels very satisfying to unravel as you discover more and more secrets as well as some of the best sound design in the industry make for an almost unforgettable experience. Easy 9/10, definitely pick it up if its ever on sale.",

I've unlocked all achievements, found all secrets, found the secret ending, and still play certain memorable parts because they are just so fucking cool man. The best way to describe this game would be; Your own description. This game means different things to different people, from possible symbolism, to governmental surveillance, to just a good story through no words. Speaking of no words; you've heard the saying for films and media: \"Show, don't tell,\" INSIDE takes that saying to heart; there is no dialogue in INSIDE. It is a puzzle game, with no true input form the protagonist, all the way to the scientists later found in the game, aside from the heavy breathing done by the protagonist during stressful parts of the game. INSIDE, to me, has an inspiration from classical books of old times such as; George Orwell's \"1984,\" Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" and aspects of Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451.\" From the empty fields, to the government surveillance, all examples provided do fit in somewhere, and they can be connected to different parts of INSIDE. But don't let this Steam review tell you all you 'need' to know before buying this game. INSIDE is a true masterpiece, one that should be remembered for what it is, and has done. Truly and amazing experience, that anyone who has read this review, should play. If you can take the time to read this, you should take the time to play the game, for this review means nothing compared to the actual game itself. Thank you for reading my review on INSIDE.",

Unlike what it's price point might suggest, the game is very well made and thought out, with intriguing puzzles and stunning visuals, while achieving an impressive amount of thrill. I couldn't put it down. A very engaging game with some gruesome elements. In my opinion it gets very weird near the end, although it manages to remain fun and engaging. If you're looking for a casual puzzle game with horror elements and engaging gameplay, I strongly recommend it.",

Most are just timing based and often require to be killed to see the obvious solution. While the visuals are great, the sound design can be very annoying and there is hardly any music. Many of the \"levels\" are simply unnecessarily large, resulting in a lot of boring/pointless walking. Imho worse and shorter than Limbo and not worth full price.",

It takes about 3 hours to complete, the story along with the ending will surely be enough to leave an impression long after you're done. Gameplay is pretty straight forward, simple controls, and the puzzles aren't super difficult but are still satisfying to figure out. Very dark in tone and very brutal. You will die a lot, in many different ways. The story is left ambiguous on purpose, some people think it's annoying when a story doesn't make any sense after it's finished, but I think it works with INSIDE just because you can make up your own theory on what the game was about. \r\nBought the game on sale but in my opinion it is worth buying at full price. \r\n\r\nLook up some trailers for this game and buy it if it looks remotely interesting. Don't look up anything else, just play it. \r\n\r\nIf you've played games like LIMBO or Little Nightmares in the past, you will feel right at home with this game. \r\n+ Graphics, visual design and animations\r\n+ Sound design \r\n+ Cool ass game\r\n+ Story \r\n\r\n- Story\r\n- Game is short :(",

I got it on sale for 1.99 when it normally goes for 20 something. I do not think 3-4 hours of game play is worth 20 dollars. The game is mostly puzzle solving. You can collect the orbs if you wish. I feel like it's kind of simple is all. Good but simple.",

My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.\n\nThank you",

I don't want to write an essay on steam so ill just say some short stuff but oh my god. The sound design in this game is like being served a 5 star full course meal, the game is practically just pure masterfully crafted sound design and i fw it so much it's unbelievable. There's sections of the game where the sound physically made me feel the intensity of the current situation, specifically referring to one section where you just got through a door where loud shockwaves could be heard from the other side. Which i instantly proceeded walking right into and got blown to smithereens and it was both so horrifying to witness but also so fucking cool. This is just one of the moments where sound made me get blown away (quite literally) but there's way more times in the game where this happens and i LOVE it! This game has inspired me greatly and i couldn't recommend it more.",
