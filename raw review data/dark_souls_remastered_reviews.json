I'd heard horror stories about how difficult it is, but having just rolled-credits on my playthrough (Benjamight Gaming), I am totally hooked.  Sure, there were moments when I wanted to screams and times of frustration - but that reward/relief I got each time I overcame some huge challenge, is unlike anything I've experienced before in a video game.  I'm absolutely playing all the FromSoft games now, and I highly recommend Dark Souls Remastered.",

        "review": "Нарешті пройшовши перший ДС, я тепер абсолютно точно розумію, чому ця гра зібрала навколо себе такий культ вірних та відданих фанатів. Навіть зараз вона впевнено дає прикурити більшості сучасних ігор в геймплеї, левелдизайні, атмосфері та багатьох інших аспектах. \r\n\r\nМоїм першим ДСом був третій, тому через це я мабуть відчув не увесь спектр можливих емоцій, будь саме ця частина моєю першою, втім я все ще залишився приємно враженим і отримав море задоволення та сюрпризів. Атмосфера в цій грі просто потрясна: я не знаю, як це передати, але, незважаючи на сеттінг темного фентезі (я би навіть сказав з елементами грім дарку), тут якась абсолютно чарівна лампова тепла атмосфера. У цьому світі просто-напросто приємно знаходитися. За рахунок шедеврального геймдизайну та особливо левелдизайну (звісно ж у першій половині гри, але про це пізніше) ти пересуваєшся по локаціям буквально на автоматі, адже дуже швидко та легко вчишся по ним орієнтуватися буквально на підсвідомому рівні. Це особливо помітно, коли вже граєш на ng+ і просто за декілька хвилин пробігаєш пів карти по відомим тобі шорткатам. Можливо це звісно ж виключно завдяки геніальності побудови рівнів, а конкретно тому, наскільки вони всі пов'язані між собою. Ні з чим не зрівняється відчуття, коли ти, здавалося б, дуже далеко вже знаходишся від святилища вогню, але потім знаходиш якийсь прихований шлях і виявляється, що цей ліфт, чи ця драбина веде до самісінького хабу або чекпоінту на самому початку локи.\r\n\r\nГеймплей тут очевидно ж теж грає далеко не останню роль. На початку він мені видався дещо заповільним, але з часом я до нього так звик, що він відчувався цілком органічним та кайфовим. Різноманіття зброї, броні та магії приємно радує, хоча і, будемо чесними, піромантія тут занадто імбалансна, адже не має ніякої залежності від атрибутів. Втім це виправдано її лорним підгрунтям, тому можна трохи закрити на це очі).\r\n\r\nПерсонажів небагато, але всі вони харизматичні та однозначно запам'ятовуються. Сюжет насправді на диво легко подається у порівнянні з третім ДСом. Якщо регулярно розмовляти з усіма персонажами, читати описи предметів, то можна отримувати цікаву, корисну та доволі вичерпну інформацію про світ гри та його ключових діячів у тому числі босів. \r\n\r\nТепер до мінусів. Перша половина гри на голову вище другої в усьому. Практично всі локації в другій половині гри не мають і близько того рівня левелдизайну, продуманості та цікавості що і перша. Tomb of the giants душна та візуально абсолютно нецікава, її єдина виразна риса і складність - це те, що там темно як у чорта в дупі. Demon Ruins та Lost Izalith хоч і естетично значно кращі за гробницю гігантів, а по лорному підгрунтю так взагалі топ, але з точки зору гейм та левел дизайну абсолютно бездарно зроблені локи, де немає ні розумного розташування противників, ні цікавих архітектурних рішень та шорткатів, ні цікавих босів. Боси тут взагалі жахливі та непродумані. Чого лише вартує Demon Firesage, який буквально один в один Stray Demon із в'язниці. У них не просто однакові модельки, та атаки, а навіть резісти і типи урону. Вдумайтеся: лавовий демон, який буквально палає, вразливий до вогню (???), а урон з його скіллів магічний, а не вогняний. Інші боси локи такі ж ніякі з 'вишенькою на торті' у вигляді Bed of Chaos. Правди заради, Duke's Archives мені навіть відносно сподобалася, але і близько не на рівні з першими локами (так, я зрештою проникся любов'ю та розумінням навіть до Blighttown). \r\nТакож загалом, будучи відвертим, боси не дуже різноманітні та цікаві. Більшість з них занадто схожа один на одного за рідкісним виключенням. \r\n\r\nПідсумовуючи, ДС1 все ще дуже і дуже хороша гра, яка задала цілі стандарти в ігровій індустрії на роки вперед, але, буду чесним, моєму сердечку все ж більше до вподоби третя частина. 7 із 10\r\n\r\n",

        "review": "Dark Souls Remastered: A Classic Reborn\r\n\r\nDark Souls Remastered is, without a doubt, a game that has stood the test of time. As the third FromSoftware game I’ve played, after Elden Ring and Sekiro, it’s a fascinating experience to dive into the origins of the genre that they perfected. Even though this game first came out in 2011, the remaster brings new life to it, making the world of Lordran more beautiful than ever. The experience is far from flawless—combat can feel frustrating at times, given the age of the game—but there’s no denying that Dark Souls is a masterpiece, and I’m excited to be so close to completing all the achievements before moving on to Dark Souls 2.\r\n\r\nA Timeless World, Breathtakingly Restored\r\n\r\nWhat immediately struck me about Dark Souls Remastered is how beautiful the world still looks, despite the game’s age. The remaster brings out the incredible level of detail that was always there but might have been obscured by the original's technical limitations. Whether you're walking through the eerie streets of Undead Burg, descending into the terrifying depths of Blighttown, or marveling at the grandeur of Anor Londo, the world feels both ancient and alive. Every corner of the map has its own story to tell, and even after all these years, it’s still a joy to explore.\r\n\r\nWhile the environments are stunning, it’s the atmosphere that really makes Dark Souls special. There’s a feeling of isolation and dread that permeates every area, pulling you deeper into its world. This sense of immersion is what sets FromSoftware apart as creators—they have a way of making you feel like you’re part of the world, rather than just playing through it.\r\n\r\nCombat: Frustrating but Rewarding\r\n\r\nNow, I won’t sugarcoat it—the combat in Dark Souls Remastered can feel rough. Compared to the fluidity of more recent FromSoftware titles like Elden Ring and Sekiro, the movement and controls in Dark Souls feel stiff and at times, unresponsive. There were moments when the game’s age really showed, and I found myself frustrated by mechanics that felt outdated or imprecise. But even with these issues, the game still delivers where it matters most: the boss fights.\r\n\r\nEach boss in Dark Souls is a unique test of patience and strategy, and while they weren’t as difficult as I expected, beating them was incredibly satisfying. The fights themselves are more about learning patterns and exploiting openings than pure reflexes, which, while different from the fast-paced duels of Sekiro, still provides a sense of accomplishment when you finally take them down. Even after some clunky combat moments, I couldn’t help but feel exhilarated each time I conquered a boss. That’s the magic of Dark Souls—it challenges you, frustrates you, but ultimately rewards you for your perseverance.\r\n\r\nA Journey of Achievements and More to Come\r\n\r\nWith only a few achievements left to complete, I can already feel the excitement building to move on to Dark Souls 2. Completing Dark Souls Remastered will mark yet another milestone in my journey through FromSoftware’s incredible catalog, and it solidifies them as my favorite creators in the industry. Their ability to create worlds that captivate, combat systems that challenge, and experiences that stay with you long after you’ve finished playing is unmatched.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\nDark Souls Remastered is more than just a nostalgic trip—it’s a testament to FromSoftware’s genius. Even with its aged combat mechanics, the game still delivers an unforgettable experience. The world, the bosses, and the sense of accomplishment you feel after each battle make it worth playing, even today. If you haven’t ventured into Lordran yet, now is the perfect time to do so. And for those, like me, who are working through all the achievements, the journey is as rewarding as ever. I can’t wait to move on to Dark Souls 2, but Dark Souls Remastered will always hold a special place as the game that helped define the genre I’ve come to love.",

I believe it precisely catches what Dark Souls is in its core.\n\nThis is a game about perseverance, determination, patience, and will. It’s also about being ready for any encounter, and any danger that may lurk in the shadows.\n\nThe real difficulty of Dark Souls lies in the demand of being persistent - you can only lose when you stop trying. However, if you keep on being watchful, methodical, and stubborn, and then if you accept the fact that you may fail at some point, that you may need to start your hard work again from scratch - you will actually win, eventually.\n\n[b]Doesn’t it sound like real life?[/b]",

I wish they would modernize some of this stuff for the remaster, like they did with Elden Ring. The sections where you have to navigate questionable, narrow paths—where the camera and collision system constantly try to kill you—are also horrible. Despite these flaws, the game is still great. 10/10.",

I think everyone who likes video games should play this game AT LEAST ONCE in their life. It is a PURE video game. What I mean by that is that everything about it is as game like as it can be. Many modern games are all about cinematics and cutscenes that look cool, but this is pure gameplay and level design. If you are not into hard games, dont worry, this game is only difficult if you're not cautious. If you look around and observe, you'll notice any traps and rarely ever die in the game. I recommend it to everyone cuz it is really fun!",

Which makes learning enemy behaviours and attack patterns feel that much more rewarding. Traversing the map is exciting due to it being interconnected, full of hidden areas and special items to find. With every new area you discover having its own gimmick. Level design is on point too with many unique encounters and good enemy density.  There are many ambushes and traps that encourage players to play  more cautious. Which makes it more engaging  especially when all your  humanity and souls are on the line.  On the subsequent runs knowing enemy locations and there agro ranges can greatly speed up the playtrough, as you can advance through the game just by dodging and manoeuvring between them. Which makes for new risky experience. Overall it’s a masterpiece, which I think is impossible to top off.",

        "review": "Dark Souls is one of the most important video games in history. This game invented a new genre that combines the complexity of a hardcore RPG with the intuitive dynamic mechanics of a third person action adventure game. Dark Souls is a masterclass in level design. The world building is one of the best I have seen in any games. This game is hard but, when you do make it and kill a boss it gives you such satisfaction that no other game can give you. And if you’re a newcomer like me wondering if you should get into souls like genre with this game, the answer is an absolute, resounding YES. Dark Souls is a masterpiece that many will be talking about for decades to come. 10/10.",

        "review": "first of all, the game world is pretty goddamn interesting, same goes for enemy design overall exploring new stuff in this game is pretty sweet. the real painful part of the game is running from the save point to the boss fight, sometimes its not a big deal other times it can be real cancerous depending on how leveled you are for the fight and such, at the end of the day its an RPG so if you arent very good at video games i would try grinding it out a bit more and maybe follow a build guide because this game will let you make a bad character.",

It is a great starting point, and really helps get you acquainted with what is going on, even if the other games change the formula somewhat, In 2024, this is still one of the best games out there.",

        "review": "Coming from Elden Ring I thought the game would be way too slow and clunky but the pacing is really nice and the combat feels really good. The interconnected world feels both vast and dense whilst not being overly confusing, and once you learn the areas the whole world feels almost comforting as you learn to navigate the strange shortcuts and passageways between locations. The visuals, while they haven't aged *well*, don't look bad and still achieve the purpose that I feel they were going for. The designs of bosses and enemies are excellent, even on those whose gameplay I like less. Almost every boss fight feels unique and interesting, and the game emphasizes the arenas you fight them in almost as much as the bosses themselves. On top of all that, the story and people you meet are both really interesting; the setup for the world and the stakes you've set are incredibly enthralling, and the way that the story is told through both it's bosses and it's world is something that FromSoftware has always been good at. Though there are some sections that I do not believe are well designed, overall the game is still an amazing experience that has given me plentiful inspiration for my own creations, and is something that I see myself revisiting in the future.",

        "review": "Alright, folks, listen up because I’ve got something HUGE to tell you. I’ve played Dark Souls, and let me just say—it's tremendous. Absolutely one of the greatest games, maybe ever. People are saying it’s tough, right? So tough. But you know what? I beat it. Of course, I beat it. I’m very good at games, everyone knows that. But the way this game challenges you—it’s like nothing else. The media doesn’t talk about this enough. They don’t want you to know about how amazing it really is, but I’m here to tell you the truth.\n\nYou start, you die. Then you die again. And then maybe, just maybe, you win. That’s life, folks. That’s how you become a winner. Dark Souls makes you work for it. It teaches you resilience, which is something our country could use a lot more of, by the way. The fake news won’t tell you that. But this game doesn’t hold your hand—just like me. It’s straightforward, tough, and honest. The enemies? Nasty. Some of the worst I’ve ever seen. You’ve got these HUGE bosses, and they’re powerful, very powerful. But you know what? You get stronger too, you beat them, and it feels fantastic. Absolutely phenomenal.\n\nThe world design? Let me tell you, folks, I build great things, big things, and the world of Dark Souls—SO IMMERSIVE. It’s like I could’ve designed it myself. Incredible attention to detail. The atmosphere, it’s dark, it’s gritty, it’s real. No phony stuff here, folks. And the lore—some of the best lore. It’s deep, like the best, the deepest. People say it’s confusing, but no, if you’re smart, you get it. I get it.\n\nAnd the community? Oh, they’re tough. They don’t take any nonsense, and I respect that. You go online, and sometimes you face off with someone in PvP—you better believe it’s a fight. But I win a lot. I win so much people are like, “Mr. Trump, please stop winning.” But I just keep going, folks.\n\nIn conclusion, Dark Souls is a winner. It’s made by FromSoftware, which, by the way, is a fantastic company. If I could give it more than 10/10, I would. Believe me. Tremendous game. Everyone should play it. It's a lot like me—tough, no-nonsense, but at the end of the day, it’s all about winning.\n\nDark Souls—make gaming great again!",

Got it free on Xbox 360 played it maybe 5 times and never touched it again. Here about a year or so ago my best friend was like he try it again. I did and I'm eating everything I have said bad about it. The game is fun like unbelievably fun. Honestly everything is much easier if you just think before you act. Thats what really makes this old game shine so brilliantly. If your smart and you approach everything thats a challenge in different ways you will complete it and enjoy the experience. I know this is a long review but I gotta tell you its a challenge if your not used to these kind of games but it is one that once you learn it you will think very fondly of it like I do now.",

        "review": "Somehow feels worse than the original version of Dark Souls [Prepare to Die]. My previous key bindings weren't able to be established in this iteration, when the conflicting keys are Menu Bindings vs. Gameplay Bindings. That shouldn't matter.\n\nFrom the jump, the control settings were a new obstacle, so I just plugged in the controller. It worked well for a while, but if I clip a video of something that happened, this new version simply stops responding to the controller, even after resetting the game, until I restart my computer entirely [while other games continue to respond at that time]. There also seem to be underlying emote bindings, because if I try to drink a potion too quickly after combat, my character will \"shrug\", and I'll die mid-battle. That *never* happened in the original game. \n\nYou still have the same god-awful spell targeting system, and you still have the same clunky roll mechanics, which I appreciate, because it keeps the game true to its natural struggle. However, I'd really appreciate it if the giant bugs in Blighttown couldn't fly through the floors. There's still lots of tediously bad mechanics from an early game design present, so if you think \"Remastered\" means the game was debugged like I did, guess again. You're still getting pretty much the same wringing that everyone else got back in the day. \n\nNot too far off from the original, but I'd prefer to play the original \"Prepare to Die\" Edition for control customization purposes. Please expand the capability of control bindings in this iteration of the game, or return the original iteration to the Steam store. [At which time I'd be happy to update this review, as a dedicated FromSoftware player]",

Dark Souls stands as a testament to what games are capable of as a medium and what games can evoke from the player. \r\n\r\nThe combat in this game is noticeably slower than future entries, which makes the high commitment, slow attacks feel very weighty. This applies to your enemy as well and most importantly, your stamina. Stamina Regen in this game is Slooooww. Personally I like this aspect. It makes combat more tactical and requires the player to be pay attention without requiring large amounts of twitch reflex. \r\n\r\nThe original Dark Souls still stands as the best in the series when it comes to aesthetic and story. I don't want to get to much into esoteric fromsoft lore because its been done to death at this point, but I quite like how refreshingly light on story the first game is, yet how concrete and complete it feels when you actually play the game. The themes of the narrative are largely the same as the themes of the gameplay, and I think that's an impressive achievement.",

Admittedly, I don't remember a great deal of what's different between the original and the Remaster. That being said, I still find the Remaster to be a worthwhile experience. If you've never played a Souls game before, this is a decent starting point; just be aware that the original released on 2011 and you'll likely experience a bit of jank playing this. I'd say start with Demon's Souls, but that's not as easy to get a hold of if you don't have a Playstation.\r\nSome other thing worth noting with this particular PC release is that the framerate is capped at 60. Otherwise, I haven't had any issues with it.",

Trash mobs always feel like a threat no matter how much you level up meaning anything can get that lucky hit and take you out. Every battle is a challenge and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you win. It doesn’t matter if you want to be a brawler who swings a large weapon, a sneaky player getting those back-stabs, or a player getting those perfect parries, you can have fun in this game. I went with a melee build but I did have some help with bows, and magic too. Boss are unique and challenging with the exception of Ornstein and Smough. That fight is terrible and at the end you will just be happy that pain is over. Once you are past those 2 the game is back to being fun and you can enjoy the fights and progression again. I did this game entirely on the Steam Deck and enjoyed how it played and looked. I even upgraded to the OLED version to get more out of it. \r\nOverall this is a good play if you light high challenges and a sense of accomplishment after the battle and a good use of a Steam Deck too.\r\nLast night I got 100% and was somewhat saddened that journey was over, on to something else.",

        "review": "A lantern is an often portable source of lighting, typically featuring a protective enclosure for the light source – historically usually a candle, a wick in oil, or a thermoluminescent mesh, and often a battery-powered light in modern times – to make it easier to carry and hang up, and make it more reliable outdoors or in drafty interiors. Lanterns may also be used for signaling, as torches, or as general light-sources outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe lantern enclosure was primarily used to prevent a burning candle or wick being extinguished from wind, rain or other causes. Some antique lanterns have only a metal grid, indicating their function was to protect the candle or wick during transportation and avoid the excess heat from the top to avoid unexpected fires.\r\n\r\nAnother important function was to reduce the risk of fire should a spark leap from the flame or the light be dropped. This was especially important below deck on ships: a fire on a wooden ship was a major catastrophe. Use of unguarded lights was taken so seriously that obligatory use of lanterns, rather than unprotected flames, below decks was written into one of the few known remaining examples of a pirate code, on pain of severe punishment.\r\n\r\nLanterns may also be used for signaling. In naval operations, ships used lights to communicate at least as far back as the Middle Ages; the use of a lantern that blinks code to transmit a message dates to the mid-1800s. In railroad operations, lanterns have multiple uses. Permanent lanterns on poles are used to signal trains about the operational status of the track ahead, sometimes with color gels in front of the light to signify stop, etc. Historically, a flagman at a level crossing used a lantern to stop cars and other vehicular traffic before a train arrived. Lanterns also provided a means to signal from train-to-train or from station-to-train.\r\n\r\nA \"dark lantern\" was a candle lantern with a sliding shutter so that a space could be conveniently made dark without extinguishing the candle. For example, in the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Red-Headed League\", the detective and police make their way down to a bank vault by lantern light but then put a 'screen over that dark lantern' in order to wait in the dark for thieves to finish tunneling. This type of lantern could also preserve the light source for sudden use when needed.\r\n\r\nLanterns may be used in religious observances. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, lanterns are used in religious processions and liturgical entrances, usually coming before the processional cross. Lanterns are also used to transport the Holy Fire from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Great Saturday during Holy Week.\r\n\r\nLanterns are used in many Asian festivals. During the Ghost Festival, lotus shaped lanterns are set afloat in rivers and seas to symbolically guide the lost souls of forgotten ancestors to the afterlife. During the Lantern Festival, the displaying of many lanterns is still a common sight on the 15th day of the first lunar month throughout China. During other Chinese festivities, kongming lanterns (sky lanterns) can be seen floating high into the air. However, some jurisdictions, such as in Canada, some states in the U.S., and parts of India, as well as some organizations, ban the use of sky lanterns because of concerns about fire and safety. \r\n\r\nThe term \"lantern\" can be used more generically to mean a light source, or the enclosure for a light source, even if it is not portable. Decorative lanterns exist in a wide range of designs. Some hang from buildings, such as street lights enclosed in glass panes. Others are placed on or just above the ground; low-light varieties can function as decoration or landscape lighting and can be a variety of colors and sizes. The housing for the top lamp and lens section of a lighthouse may be called a lantern.\r\n\r\nLanterns were usually made from a metal frame with several sides (usually four, but up to eight) or round, commonly with a hook or a hoop of metal on top. Windows of some translucent material may be fitted in the sides; these are now usually glass or plastic but formerly were thin sheets of animal horn, or tinplate punched with holes or decorative patterns.\r\n\r\nPaper lanterns are made in societies around the world.\r\n\r\nA lantern generally contains a burning light source: a candle, liquid oil with a wick, or gas with a mantle. The ancient Chinese sometimes captured fireflies in transparent or semi-transparent containers and used them as (short-term) lanterns, and use of fireflies in transparent containers was also a widespread practice in ancient India; however, since these were short-term solutions, the use of fire torches was more prevalent.\r\n\r\nModern varieties often place an electric light in a decorative glass case.\r\n\r\nIn 1417, the Mayor of Anor Londo ordered that all homes must hang lanterns outdoors after nightfall during the winter months. This marked the first organized public street lighting. \r\n\r\nLanterns have been used functionally, for light rather than decoration, since antiquity. Some used a wick in oil, while others were essentially protected candle-holders. Before the development of glass sheets, animal horn scraped thin and flattened was used as the translucent window.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the Middle Ages, middle eastern towns hired watchmen to patrol the streets at night, as a crime deterrent. Each watchman carried a lantern or oil lamp against the darkness. The practice continued up through at least the 18th century.\r\n\r\nIn March 1764 and twice in October 1764, George Allsopp, a British-born Canadian, was arrested in Quebec for violating an order to carry lanterns during the night. There was violence every time he was arrested and Allsopp would denounce the military. In October he prosecuted the soldiers involved in his arrests.\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1775, Paul Revere had two lanterns held up in the Old North Church to signal to patriots in Charlestown that the British troops were crossing the Charles River to disarm the rebel colonial militias. The Battles of Lexington and Concord occurred the day after on April 19, starting the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nPublic spaces became increasingly lit with lanterns in the 1500s, especially following the invention of lanterns with glass windows, which greatly improved the quantity of light. In 1588 the Parisian Parlement decreed that a torch be installed and lit at each intersection, and in 1594 the police changed this to lanterns. Beginning in 1667 during the reign of King Louis XIV, thousands of street lights were installed in Parisian streets and intersections. Under this system, streets were lit with lanterns suspended 20 yards (18 m) apart on a cord over the middle of the street at a height of 20 feet (6.1 m); as an English visitor described in 1698, 'The streets are lit all winter and even during the full moon!' In Anor Londo, a diarist wrote in 1712 that ‘All the way, quite through Hyde Park to the Queen's Palace at Kensington, lanterns were placed for illuminating the roads on dark nights.’",

Love the worldbuilding and how all the npc's feel alive. Every victory feels very rewarding once you finally earn it because there really is no unfair boss fight, you just need to work for it and find a way.\n\nPS: Devs should be locked up for making Sif a mandatory boss fight.",

Level design, although interconnected, is a slog. Bosses are a joke. The boss are the levels themselves. Cheap annoyances galore. I've never rage quite so many times. Not because of the bosses, I usually get them in 1-5 tries. No, just getting to the bosses means 10-20 deaths, at least. Fast travel is annoying, bonfire placement is horrendous, hitting my weapon on the damn wall, the camera sucks, movement is sluggish, most bosses are pushovers, 5-10 enemy gang-ups, can't sprint while locked on, what ever the Fuck Lost Izalith and Tomb of the giants are, awful enemy hit-boxes (fuck you titanite demons). Play it once for the experience and lore, and then burn it. At least Fromsoft have learned from their mistakes and their new games far surpass this one, especially BB. They could have and should have fixed the game with patches or even this remaster, but apparently don't want to.",

        "review": "First time playing any Souls game and it really is a great game. Most gamers have heard that Souls games are hard, but honestly I don't think that is accurate. I have played plenty of games that are harder and I am in no way a god gamer.\n\nThat said, it is EXTREMELY punishing. If you just run in guns a blazin you will die. If you ignore mechanics you will die. If you rush, you will die. And if you get cursed, well... just don't get cursed lol.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are NOT explained. You don't need to follow guides, but I would at least recommend looking up some things like what the character stats do, equip load, weapon upgrades, and how humanity works.\n\nThere is a very slight amount of jank in the controls, but for the most part this game has aged beautifully and has been a super positive introduction to the Souls series.\n\nP.S. Some of the messages people write are trolls... Do NOT kill the non-hostile NPCs unless you want to permanently remove their quest lines from your first playthrough :(",

        "review": "Dark Souls is known for its punishing difficulty and epic boss fights, and for good reason. The bosses are genuinely challenging, often pushing you to the brink. But the satisfaction of finally defeating them after numerous attempts is second to none. Every victory feels earned, and the thrill of mastering each encounter is one of the game’s biggest strengths.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the difficulty is a core part of the experience, there are some design choices that make the game more frustrating than it needs to be. I’m all for a tough challenge, but the game's poor quality of life decisions stand out. For example, having to trek long distances from a bonfire to a boss after every death feels unnecessary. These small annoyances are scattered throughout the game and often take away from the enjoyment of overcoming the core challenge.\r\n\r\nOverall, Dark Souls delivers an unforgettable experience with its incredible boss fights and atmospheric world, but these unnecessary frustrations keep it from being a true masterpiece in my eyes. That said, it's still a great game for those who enjoy testing their skills in a harsh but rewarding environment.",

        "review": "Dark Souls: Remastered is a breathtaking revival of one of gaming’s most influential titles, bringing the legendary experience of its original release into the modern era with stunning visuals and improved performance. FromSoftware has successfully rekindled the magic of Lordran, making it accessible and exhilarating for both newcomers and seasoned veterans alike.\n\nAt its core, Dark Souls remains a paragon of challenging gameplay. The refined mechanics and responsive controls ensure that every encounter feels fair yet punishing. From the exhilarating feeling of mastering a boss fight to the dread of facing relentless enemies, every moment is designed to keep you on your toes. \n\nThe intricacy of the combat system encourages experimentation with different builds, making each playthrough unique. The world of Lordran is a masterpiece of design. The interconnected areas, hidden pathways, and clever shortcuts invite exploration and reward curiosity. The lore is rich and layered, unfolding through environmental storytelling and cryptic NPC interactions. Piecing together the history of the world is as satisfying as the combat itself, immersing players in a narrative that lingers long after the game is over.\n\nThe remaster includes upgraded online functionality, allowing for smoother multiplayer interactions. Cooperative play and competitive invasions are more accessible than ever, fostering a vibrant community that adds depth to the experience. Summoning friends for epic battles or engaging in thrilling PvP duels enhances the game’s replayability. The remastered sound design elevates the experience, with haunting melodies and impactful sound effects that enhance the immersion. From the echoing clang of weapons to the ominous ambiance of darkened areas, the audio design plays a crucial role in creating the oppressive atmosphere that Dark Souls is known for.",

Nevertheless it was a very fun experience and at times very challenging (boss runbacks, bonfire placement).\r\n\r\nThe movement does feel clunky (in comparison with more modern titles like DS3 and ER) but you get used to it. In turn most enemies are also slower.\r\nThe visuals are great, the interconnection with the Firelink Shrine was very stunning and the overall story is obviously unmatched. 10/10",

        "review": "This game is not hard, and never was. It's one of the biggest collective lies in all of gaming. After you clear Sen's Fortress, the level design (mostly) stops being ass, enemies stop having way too much health and the game doesn't feel nearly as oppressive. Not a single boss in this game is more difficult than Gundyr from Dark Souls 3 (either version).\n\nThe main reason that this game is considered so challenging is because it is lacking so, so, SO many quality of life features that later Soulslikes would implement without a second thought. I cannot tell you how many times throughout my playthrough I had the thought \"Man, if I was playing Elden Ring right now, I wouldn't have died there\". And the argument that this is only the second real game of its kind can only go so far before it's clear that the design of this game is just inherently half-baked. If EVERY SINGLE game that comes after this one can get basic things about the genre correct, then I should be allowed to criticize their progenitor for not having them.\n\nSo why am I reviewing this positively if I have only negative things to say? Well, simply put, I still had a lot of fun. It felt cool to gradually see my character go from a guy who dies from a dust particle landing on him to a badass samurai pyromancer who can kill everything in a couple of strikes. The world feels well constructed and intricate, if a little barren compared to later Fromsoft titles (although I am really not a fan of how this game is basically a Metroidvania for its first half, but that's mostly because anyone who follows my reviews knows I just really hate Metroidvanias and the way they've commodified pointless backtracking in gaming). I have no idea why people say this game \"peaks at Anor Londo\". Most of my favorite levels--The Duke's Archives, Oolacile Township, The Painted World of Ariamis, etc.) can only be accessed after Ornstein and Smough, who by the way are still a really cool fight even if they've kind of been lionized to an unrealistic degree by the fanbase. In fact--and this is my real opinion, not a \"le contrarian\" one--I think my favorite level in this entire game is Lost Izalith. People give it so much shit for being \"unfinished\", but it doesn't feel that way while actually playing it, and it's such a cool environment with balanced enemy encounters (make fun of the copy-pasted Taurus Demons all you want, but they're appropriately scaled for the region) and a boss fight that is not anywhere as frustrating as hardcore soulslike players make it out to be. If you really start having a hissy fit over a boss with checkpoints, something almost NO soulslike bosses have, and that requires maybe three restarts minimum if you're bad at platforming or underleveled, why are you even playing this game (or a fan of this genre, for that matter)?\n\nAs I briefly mentioned, this game has a lot of the same problems as Demon's Souls in terms of boss quality, by which I mean the easy bosses are pitiful and the \"hard\" bosses are only hard if you've never ever played a game with this control scheme before or haven't leveled health. My favorite boss was probably Manus, because as neat as Artorias is he has some janky hitboxes and I feel like everything with Manus is fair and telegraphed while still providing a decently tense challenge.\n\nAlso as I mentioned, this game has an extremely punishing early-game that can feel genuinely unfun at times, but it is not the bugbear that everyone has always made it out to be. My father could probably beat this game with practice, and he plays games on story difficulty. (if you're somehow reading this, this is not a diss. I promise. I love you and respect your gaming decisions.) My hypothesis of how this game got its overinflated reputation for being difficult has always been that games journalists who couldn't get past Sen's Fortress or got stuck in Blighttown published stuff primarily dealing with the hardest parts of the game (to be clear, I am not being a chud \"games journalists le bad\" gamer here. They have a limited amount of time to review stuff and if they get stuck on something it's going to influence their perception of the game, and I don't hold it against them. They were just doing their jobs), which caused it to gain a reputation of being this SUPER DUPER ULTRA HARD MEGA BALL BUSTING GAME FOR REAL GAMERS ONLY when it's an averagely difficult fantasy RPG with a handful of challenging parts like any other. There have been games before and after Dark Souls that are much, much harder to play, let alone beat.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say with this winded review is that while I like Dark Souls and have huge respect for how it inspired several of my favorite games ever down the line, it isn't the untouchable masterpiece people say it is and beating it doesn't feel like a \"badge of honor\" in the same way beating other Soulslikes does to me. Thanks for listening to me ramble, you can advance my questline now.",

        "review": "Infamously known as one of the most challenging games which It Is definitely not. I'd say It's rather one of the most punishing games I've ever played. Bonfires are very scarce meaning If you die especially during most boss fights you have to backtrack all the way back which gets repetitive. Many elements of the game go unexplained and are only barely hinted If you listen to the characters which most of the voice acting is whispered for whatever reason. Getting one shot is extremely common and feels very cheap combined with the lack of checkpoints makes a frustrating combo. If you die you lose all your souls and have only one chance to recover them which was very frustrating on my first playthrough. It gets entertaining on the second playthrough when you know all the tricks and are able to obliterate all the enemies that were being annoying on the first playthrough. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes being bullied by game developers with the later satisfaction of bullying the game back.",

Basically, as a game I think this is great (ignoring a few things like bed of chaos, but you probably already knew that). As a remaster, this game still looks worse than Dark souls 3 which is weird since it came out after it. Either way, it's a must play if you like Fromsoft",

Read the entire review for more Deck-related informations.\n\nEven with a TDP of 8W these 60FPS seem rock solid at the beginning of the game, going to edit my review if that'll change in later areas.\n\nlike in almost every game i use 1152x720 to trigger the decks internal FSR feature (most games require windowed mode to enable it, a minority fullscreen, check performance-overlay 4 if it is on or off) with sharpness set to 4 out of 5. \n\nThat removes the slightly blurry visuals i get from the native 1280x800 resolution has and gives me a crisp and clean picture without any flickering in most games. It even makes more details pop out the textures that were lost in the blur.\n\nwould love to get some comments from other deckers after comparing FSR ON vs OFF in this game - thanks",

Your boss designs, and that gorgeous setting. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I could play you all day. You had a rough development, but you never gave up hope.  You're a great game, sometimes I even call you the goat. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day get old. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your devloper's beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first were not on steam and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you get remastered, because deep down, my glorious game deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2019 was a hard year for us baby, but in 2018 you made history happen. Not only have you changed the game of games and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, Dark souls remastered. 🥰❤️🫶🏽\n",

        "review": "Very cool idea, botched by poor execution. The game is not hard at all, I don't know what people talk about. It's just poorly designed in some very crucial places. \n\nAmazing:\n- combat system - many enemies have a weak point that you can figure out eventually and exploit. This is very fun to explore. Some enemies are very dull though - titanite demon vs melee build is boring... You need to make 50 hits to kill it, can only make 1 hit between it's attack sequences so it takes ages.\n- amazing world design\n- no saves\n- visuals\n\nGood:\n- no handholding\n- difficulty level\n\nAll of this forces to have an experience as intended and brings enjoyable adrenaline-packed action experience. \n\nBad:\n- game design - for the game you are supposed to try different things there is too much grind. I can get to the boss with my eyes closed before I can figure out how to defeat them, making me try cheesy tactics in the most interesting part of the game. This means you spend 95% time doing same thing again just to get to the fun part, and don't enjoy the fun part because of fear to grind yet again. This is why we hate mobile games, this has the same vibe. I don't understand why not make checkpoints before boss fights. Souls are not that valuable to loose anyway, levels are super easy to grind.\n- game design - for a game with this many narrow corridors, making melee attack hit against the wall was very silly choice. Basically weapons without thrusting attacks are very risky to use, so throw them away immediately. Same for narrow ledges - can't fight on them as attack animation like to do a little step to the side. Enemies are bugging out, takes minutes to lure them out, it's only fun first couple of times.\n- bugs. For example rats... Poison is long lasting and is introduced in the game at the time where there is no antidote. It's super easy to avoid, however game often bugs on rats - sometimes they do double attacks (new attack animation starts in the mid of previous one), sometimes rats don't die - I just brought health bar to 0, and it's full again, no extra corpse. Basically, if game does not bug out - easy, if it does - guaranteed going back to bonfire, so we are back to point 1.\n- camera. I play on PC and don't use lock on. Lock on is terrible - once enemy moves sometimes camera gets stuck against player and the wall, and I can't see anything. Without lock on I still need to babysit camera otherwise it turns randomly... \n\nWhilst I did enjoy the idea so much, I wish this was better made. If you really want to get into souls games, try another part in the franchise, maybe they improved with time. \n\nP.S. I still continued after writing the review, and I am ready to forgive many things for gargoyle boss fight. <3 However, I still believe this was unfinished game when released, and many omissions/mistakes were just marketed as intended \"difficulty\".",

        "review": "I'm really trying my best to enjoy this game, and will most likely finish it anyways, but It's extremely hard for me to like. Elden Ring was my first souls game, and you're probably thinking \"Well then it's a skill issue because DS1 is harder than Elden Ring.\" but that's not what I don't like about DS1. For starters, the level design is really odd. I have no idea where to go because I keep getting bombarded by enemies that are too tough for my level, not to mention the amount of sneaky pathways there are. The enemies themselves (not the bosses) are a big problem because for a non-open world game, there are too many. I have to fight around 5-10 at a time and that's much too tedious especially when about 90% of the enemies in the game have shields. not only that, but the hitboxes of attacks from bosses (and some enemies) are the worst I've every seen. Most of the hitboxes just make no sense or activate and the completely wrong times. Also why is like 50% of this game long narrow hallways? I can't swing my weapon at all because of walls half the time. Another thing is that dodging is horribly optimized unless you're using a light load, which is pretty much impossible for newer players at the beginning. If you've never played a souls game before, trust me, this is NOT the one to start with.",

        "review": "The first Dark Souls has always been a very special game for me. I was among the people who signed the petition to release a PC port. I spent hundreds of hours in Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition back in 2013, especially in PvP. And even after all the following games of From Software, I kept loving the first DS the most.\n\nThe DLC for Elden Ring was kind of a disappointment for me though. I still haven’t managed to complete it. I kept doing everything I could to avoid playing it. And eventually it brought me to Dark Souls Remastered. This was my first walkthough in a decade, which allowed me to look into the game from a different point of view. And the game is still great!\n\nFirst Dark Souls has the most impressive world design in the series. It’s not a set of independent levels but an interconnected world, which unfolds while you progress through the game. I can’t even describe that joy I felt during my first playthrough, when I found that elevator leading to the Firelink Shrine from the Undead Church. And DS1 is full of such valuable shortcuts and passages to the previously visited locations.\n\nThe locations, their surroundings, enemies and items are very consistent with the game’s lore, which, for instance, DS2 lacks.\n\nLater From Software games allow us to teleport to any bonfire from the very beginning. But DS1 gives the limited teleportation options only in the second half of the game. And now I understand this approach better due to all that interconnectedness of the world and shortcuts. This approach also makes the world exploration more consistent, since your learn all the locations by heart. Like I said, I hadn’t played DS1 for almost a decade, but I still remembered the geography of the world, and locations of the most valuable items and enemies. On the other hand, DS1 is full of backtracking, especially because some important NPCs are based in different and not always easily accessible places, so you have to run a lot.\n\nDS1 combat system is less reliant on some magical attacks and special moves but rather on slow and tactical approach and studying the wide moveset of every weapon. You can find some of the best weapons, such as Zweihander or Claymore, in the first 20 minutes of playthrough. Also, the armor is, perhaps, the best in the series. Havel set, for instance, allows you to easily tank some of the bosses, which is unimaginable for the later games.\n\nDuring my first playthrough, I had suffered from almost every single boss. I spent several hours on runbacks to Taurus demon. Kapra was burning my butt. Ornstein and Smough came to me in my nightmares. I remember shouting and running around my room when I first killed Artorias. With extensive experience with future From Software games, I can tell that DS1 is actually quite easy. Almost all the bosses are very slow, with predictable attacks and can be easily cheesed, if you know the tactics and their weaknesses. Even the Bed of Chaos can be easily cheesed. \n\nThe Estus upgrade mechanics, as well as the Humanity parameter, are unique for the series.\n\nThe Estus is kinda dubious though. An experienced player can get the Rite of Kindling in the first 20 minutes of the game. In a casual playthrough though, you will get it only in the second part of the game. And kindling the bonfires requires spending the humanity, which is a limited consumable through the game, and farming it consistently becomes possible only at the later stages of the game. Also, you need to spend several humanities for a single bonfire, which means that you need to carefully choose which ones to invest in. And this, in turn, means that you will be running with 5-10 Estuses throughout most of the game. The Estus shards mechanic from the later game is much better, IMO. \n\nThe Humanity itself is cool, since it implements kind of an additional high risk – high reward mechanics. Humanity increases your defense, resistances, item discovery and damage from the chaos weapons. You loose it with death but you have a chance to pick it up once, as well as your souls.\n\nWhat if often criticized about DS1 is the second part of the game. While the trip to Anor Londo is very exciting and actually leaves an impression of a long road behind, the locations from the second part of the game are dull and poorly designed. In my opinion, there are good and bad locations through the whole game. I love the Undead Parish, Anor Londo and Duke’s Archieves as much as I hate the Depths, Blighttown, Tombs the Giants and Izalith.\n\nAnother aspect of the first Dark Souls is that it is not the most technologically advanced game from PS3 and Xbox 360. And even the Remastered version looks like an old and sometimes ugly game. It does not scare me, but it might scare new players, who came from Elden Ring.\n\n",

        "review": "An Unforgettable Journey:\r\nI recently completed Dark Souls Remastered, and I can confidently say that it's one of the most captivating and rewarding gaming experiences I’ve ever had. Yes, this game is notoriously hard and brutal, but that challenge is exactly what makes it so addictive. Every encounter feels like a test of skill, patience, and perseverance, and the feeling of finally overcoming a tough boss is unlike anything else.But Dark Souls isn’t just about difficulty—it’s a masterclass in storytelling. The game’s lore is deep, intricate, and beautifully woven into the world. Rather than spoon-feeding the plot, it encourages players to piece together the story themselves, which made it resonate with me on a much deeper level. The atmosphere is dark, mysterious, and immersive, pulling me further into its world with every step.\r\n\r\nThe NPCs, too, are wonderfully crafted. Among them, Solaire of Astora, aka “Sunbro” .His unwavering optimism and desire to “praise the sun” provided a perfect contrast to the game's often bleak tone. He’s a character that stays with you long after you put down the controller.\r\nIf you’re someone who enjoys a challenge and appreciates a richly developed world, Dark Souls Remastered is a must-play. It’s more than just a game; it’s an experience that stays with you long after the final boss is defeated.",

        "review": "I was originally nervous to play Dark Souls because I had already experienced everything Form Software learned throughout the Souls series, so I might see it as worse than the rest. Well I was half right, Dark Souls does some things worse than the games that came after, but it also does things no other game in the series ever tries again. Despite its flaws as a “first” of many, it is still truly an awesome game that introduced so much to the world. I respect it like I would Ocarina of Time, except it’s actually fun to play. I’d like to talk about all of the little things that make this game great and a piece of work.\n\nThis game’s combat is more stilted than it is in the rest of the series. Bosses may look cool but they fight so simply to the point that their designs or movements don’t matter, you just do the same thing every time. Having played the rest of the games, they’re also pretty easy. The main character’s movement isn’t the best but it gets the job done. I remember it was very frustrating when I killed an enemy and their body still blocked me, leading to me getting killed by others surrounding me. This was a temporary issue though. Everyone knows the last third of the game feels rushed. The demon area is practically empty, the giant tree boss is probably the worst boss I’ve fought in the Souls series, the crystal area is cool, but also pretty empty, its boss is not a great time, and the depths of the catacombs are hardly worth mentioning. Gwyn is also a total pushover once you reach him. If it weren’t for this game’s DLC, things would have ended on a sour note, but it didn’t. This leads to what I adore about this game. \n\nThe first thing I found unique about DS1 was its paintbrush art style and sound design. In the right places, like Firelink Shrine, everything looks and sounds soothing. When looking at the distance in large areas like Anor Londo and the Great Hollow, there’s a blurriness that I prefer over it being a sharp image. There was a large lack of ambient music which made me appreciate the sounds surrounding me. The wind blowing on rooftops, the noises of the forest, the emptiness of the catacombs, and the constant clinking of my armor immersed me more than any music could. The voice acting in this game (besides the player character since he sounds like he’s having an orgasm whenever he gets hit) is unlike any other game I have played. I honestly can’t describe how they all sound but it just feels right and calming in a way. The massively titted woman was an excellent reward for beating Ornstein and Smough. Because of DS3, I was dead set on completing Seigmeyer’s quest. He was such a jolly guy. I reached the point where he was looking down at a bunch of monsters and he needed my help to kill them. I poison-arrowed four of them and left the last one to him. He dropped down, we attacked at the same time, and Havel armored dumbass killed him with my giant strength build sword. This devasted me far more than the intended ending for his questline could. I found the way you start and kindle your flame quite satisfying what with how the fire crackled more as it grew bigger. I grew to appreciate how interconnected this world was. It was daunting at first but it became easy to know exactly how to get anywhere. Different areas blended together as if they were all one area. It’s honestly impressive that this was their first attempt at making an interconnected world and it is still one of the best I have ever seen. Despite my nagging about how inconsequential most of the bosses felt, there are some real highlights. My favorite in the base game was the Four Kings. This wasn’t because of how they fought or looked, but because the battleground was pitch black so it was difficult to determine how far away you are from them. Me running at them and swinging too soon felt like I was in a dream where I couldn’t catch up to someone. The Painted Lady freaked me out when she disappeared and beat me up with her scythe and Sif, the giant sword-wilding wolf, was also exciting and sad to play against. I like that he gets a different cutscene if you do the DLC before fighting him. Speaking of the DLC, it hits like a truck. I was taken aback by how intimidating and heart-pumping Artorias was to fight. It was a huge improvement over the base game and is easily the most memorable in DS1. He’s also a Berserk reference with his vertical flip swing. The area leading up to Manus genuinely creeped me out when the humanity ghosts appeared, the illusory ledge disappeared, and when I found a small Sif guarded by those ghosts. Manus was one of the only bosses where I had to make a second attempt against him because I was so intimidated by him. All of the cutscenes in the DLC were killer but watching the blind giant smithy snipe the dragon out of the sky made my jaw drop. At the end of all this, I had such a great time in the DLC but I was also underwhelmed by how short it was. It was finally time to take on Gwyn. Entering his area and seeing the beautiful desolation of the coliseum was an excellent lead-up to him. I still wish he weren’t so easy but his music popped off. As the credits of this game rolled, I was deeply satisfied with this game despite my frustrations, which perfectly sums up every great souls-like game out there, except this one started it all. What a behemoth of a game. Miyazaki, you crazy fuck, you did it again. \n",

        "review": "Dark Souls is basically the line of quality for this type of game, but by no means is it perfect. I do personally feel as though newer games, both from From Soft and other devs have largely worked to fix almost every main issue.\n\nDark Souls introduced the world to Demon's Souls, a Playstation 3 exclusive that managed to win several accolades and generate a very good user impression, but was bogged down by being on the PS3, a system that was failing at the time to keep up with the faster selling Xbox 360. Demon's Souls has only a few elements not seen in Dark.\n\nEnter Lordran, a dying kingdom beyond the reality. You are an Undead, a human who walks the land, forever unable to die. Most are like this, and many have been corralled into the Asylum, where you start to await the end of the world, but few have kept their sanity, or at least shreds of it, and roam the land in search of a way to complete the Undead's Goal, to ring two bells of Awakening and learn the final part of their task. To do this, you'll create a character, choose a class and starting item and then be unleashed with little guidance beyond the few cryptic NPCs you do find.\n\nThe world is still the highlight of this game, discovering secret passages and opening gates makes traversing this highly unforgiving land interesting and rewarding as it loops in on itself and interconnects. The lore is sparse enough to not require your care, but deep enough to fill a novel or two, should you delve into it.\n\npros of Dark Souls generally:\n-brilliant game--despite my own complaints and its obtrusive difficulty, or perhaps because of them, its one of the most rewarding games ever made. Beating a boss you have been struggling against and surmounting impossible odds will always be amongst the best feelings in gaming.\n-storyline intentionally invokes themes of oppression, depression, and impossibility; not only is it rewarding to be able to dispatch bosses because of the VERY hard nature of this game, but the scant NPCs and cutscenes support you as fulfilling an impossible task. Those with depression or anxiety tend to connect to this game intensely.\n\npros of the PC version:\n-60 fps MASSIVELY improves the playability and feel of the game. having come from console versions (that i could never beat), i can flatly state that the game is better, slightly easier, and more fun for it.\n-rebindable controls are always a plus, and the KB/M controls mostly match newer From Software games. also works with extra mouse inputs.\n-game looks good, and will run at 60 fps on 4k res with just about any mid tier system. also takes less than 10 GBs of space.\n\n\nnow we move on to the stuff some newer games have fixed:\n-this is the slowest Souls/Borne, save the original Demons Souls. Every newer game feels more responsive without sacrificing the intentionality.\n-newer games aren't easier to play, but easier to KEEP playing--other games have more optional bosses and a few choice QoL improvements to reduce frustration. When you hit a boss you dont think you can beat, there's almost nowhere to go and nothing to do aside from grind souls and buy better gear or level up.\n\nI do not recommend without a sale, 40 dollars for a 6 year old remaster of a 15 year old game with basically dead multiplayer feels wrong. I also don't really recommend it for curiosity, if you liked Elden Ring, maybe try Sekiro or Dark Souls 3 instead, as this one is significantly clunkier.",

Combine this with the really annoying parrying and the walking simulator that is this game, its just bad. Games story is amazing though, along with the visuals. Oh yeah, and omni-directional rolling isnt in the game, it sucks.",

If you kill the final boss, the game immediately puts your save file into new game+, with no warning or choice.  I still had dlc, and the Devs nuked my save file.  Totally ruined any satisfaction I had about finally finishing this mess.",

While some mechanics are beginning to show their age, I still believe that Dark Souls 1 is the best designed single/interconnected dungeon of any game that I've ever played (particularly until you get the Lord Vessel). This game and the original Legend of Zelda hold top place on my games of all time list. These days I play through this game periodically like watching a favorite television show, while it is still challenging--I know almost every inch of the game and function like comfort food. This PC version is the third system that I'm playing the game on and have 100% the game on both PS4 and Switch.",

        "review": "One very obvious point but I will say it nonetheless.\nThis game plays a whole lot more different than Elden Ring (duh) and that is not a bad thing. I come from Dark Souls 3 and then played elden ring after that and now back to Dark Souls so it is getting used to not press E+LMB lol.\n\nOn my first inpression, the game is a whole lot slower than Elden Ring and even Dark Souls 3. So that is something else to get used to.\n\nBut in my quick 1.5hr session I had fun and will gladly play it till completion.\n\nA quick note, if you get to the tower that goes up in a round staircase and you see a closed door infront of you, just go up for now return there later. (Had to find it out the hard way lmao)",

If I paid full price I would be furious. \n\nThe fighting is clumpy, controller response is extremely delayed (any other game I played with a wired controller, I have never had this kind of delay in response time. A game like this needs very responsive actions. \n\nIt's a Remaster??? What exactly did From Software actually do? Looks and performs like a game from 2008 but yet the Remaster was in 2018? \n\nCannot Recommend. Not because of the challenge, but because of things I listed with just one hour of game play. I am sure if I played longer I would have more complaints.",

        "review": "Although it’s a 2018 remaster, the visuals are vastly inferior to those of other titles from that year, or even from the previous year.\n\nThe controls aren't great either, the movement is slow, and dodge rolling is clunky compared to newer Souls games. It’s frustrating to walk around and constantly get stuck on small ledges in the terrain. While the tutorial dungeon is well designed, the game quickly becomes unbalanced afterward: even the weakest skeleton enemies have about ten times more health than they should, making them tedious to defeat. You can't simply run past them either, as they'll chase you through the entire first area, which is more irritating than challenging.\n\nOverall, the game feels outdated, and I can’t recommend it in 2024.\n\nInstead, I suggest getting Elden Ring, which is an excellent game, or trying Dark Souls III.",

This is a definite no.\n\nIf you have never played Elden Ring before, then yeah sure try this one out. It'll make you appreciate the beauty of Elden Ring even more. The difference between heaven and earth.\n\nMy thoughts:\n1. This game is about 20 yrs old.\n2. No sprint, no jump. The default 'run' is slow as heck. Dodge is clumsy and slow. \n3. Got stuck in the prison starting area running around like a headless chicken trying to find out where I'm suppose to go. \n4. Graphics, intro was nice but in game, its what you'd expect from an old game. \n5. If you've already been spoiled by Elden Ring, it would be like downgrading your Ferrari 350 for a Suzuki Swift. \n\nYou might like it if you really wanna give it a go but its a definite no for me. 20 mins into the game, my brain attempted to commit $uicide.",

Disliked some of the really long foot travel, \"eventually\" there are Warps to specific points, still a lot of running. Disliked the stagger/recovery mechanic specifically when the mobs kept swinging while you were down. Many times that was just game over, no-win.",

Dark Souls is filled to the brim with assists and aid and relief in places you'd never expect to find it. \n\nDark Souls is like no other game I've ever played. at once profoundly beautiful and hideous, profoundly rewarding and frustrating, elating and depressing, light, and dark. without the struggle of bullshit deaths to the capra demon, the triumph of beating it wouldn't be the same. without the misery of crawling through Blighttown, the glorious sky of Anor Londo wouldn't be as jaw dropping. the game will be rough to play. it absolutely will. but you can beat it, and when you're standing in front of the door to the final boss, thinking back on each roadblock you found insurmountable, that feeling will stay with you for your entire life. \n\nalso, practical advice for people who genuinely want to give the game a fair shot, pick Pyromancer, go for a strength build, and grab the Zwihander from behind firelink shrine, just sprint past the skeletons. that's a weapon you can beat the entire game with, (and i have, twice) so you can't go wrong with upgrading it, and should do that as often as possible.",

The games inter-connected zones are just amazing, there is usually multiple ways to get to an area, some more secretive then others. I found the second half just as enjoyable as the first, when looking at the story all the zones just really make sense and fit the narrative. True, they are not all on the Anor Londo scale of vistas, but climbing down into the swamp from the rafters of Blightown and to the darkness of the Catacombs, they were all great. But watch out for those Bone Wheels, they can truly ruin your day quick. All the bosses were enjoyable in their own ways and none weren't overly that difficult. Even Manus was bested around 40 attempts. Tons of weapons, spells and builds to choose from to fit many styles. It's fun, challenging and really intriguing. Really just an awesome game all around.",

I'll leave a video about some problems below.\n\nI found the remaster pretty much the same as the vanilla game. A few sprites changed, effects on bosses like Artorias but may not even notice much difference. Yes, some armors looks way less attractive with the new shader but some others like the Siegmeyer of Catarina's one looks a bit better. The lighting in some areas just looks like it has a bit more of fake baked GI but nothing too drastic.\n\nSide by side:\nhttps://youtu.be/n2eos3V7jTI\n\nA very  negative video about the remaster (mostly about PvP):\nhttps://youtu.be/ZhkeJncVxjs\n\nI have this also on PS4. On PC looks really nice with better AA. A I still recommend the remaster because it feels pretty much the same.",

It's story, scattered throughout item descriptions, NPC dialogue or visual storytelling, that more often than not leads to tragedy in a world that has seen better days (while not being totally hopeless and still pushing you forward). To the characters that feel so alive in their search for purpose in such a desolate world, at the same time making your journey less lonely as their stories progress alongside yours. Finally, I'd have to mention the amazing music that serves to further the hostility of the world as it is mostly reserved for boss fights (the exceptions being hauntingly beautiful) with your moment to moment gameplay being filled with the sounds of your armour and weapons. Then again, you could ignore all of this and finish it purely enjoying the gameplay, the game won't hold your hand and take away your agency.\n\nHaving clocked in around 1000hrs across different platforms I can definitely say this is my favourite game, give it a chance <3",

        "review": "Cons:\n1. The final areas of the game feel half-baked, but not lacking in compelling lore.\n2. The DLC areas are a requirement, but getting to it is overly convoluted.\n3. This game with a remaster and all is still capped frame rate wise and the stuttering that exists in all FromSoftware games is not fixed. (This was only ever fixed in Dark Souls 2 for some reason).\n\nPros:\n1. The best level design outside the Zelda games. Still after 13 years is a marvel.\n2. The atmosphere. A true game about the concept of limbo.\n3. after several other games after this where they improved the boss fights, Knight Artorias stands out.\n\nThis game, something about it has perpetually wedged itself in my brain since first playing it in 2011. Maybe it has something to do with it being the modern day Zelda game that I have always wanted, but it might be something deeper. My first games were the likes of Myst and Riven where you are a random person dropped in a strange world and the only thing you can do is \"fix\" it. Dark Souls embodies this concept just with an extra layer of engaging combat. \n\nIn some ways FromSoftware has gone on to do better but always with an asterisk. Dark Souls 2 had better combat and improved frame rates, but lacked the same engaging boos fights and story. Dark Souls 3 has some of the best bosses of the series, but the level design is nowhere near as compelling. Elden Ring gets back to the root of the \"feeling\" of playing the first Dark Souls, but all becomes a bland slog through an open world. This all excluding Bloodborne which is the best game they've made.\n\nIncredible, iconic and irritating are words I would use to describe Dark Souls.",

        "review": "In case your Intimidated by everyone saying the game is super hard, only for hardcore gamers and masochists or anything else of that sort: thats just not really the case. Dark Souls can be enjoyed and played by everyone and is pretty accesible even to casual gamers. The core game might be pretty challenging but theres lots of ways to make the game easier: Summoning NPCs to help you out, using walkthroughs, cheese strategys, grinding levels early on. All these are strategys that can make your expierience much, much smoother. aside from that, i would give the game like a 9,5 out of 10: The gameplay is not as fast paced, adrenaline loaded and smooth as in most other Soulsborne games but stays fun and exiting, the lore, story and athmosphere of this game are amazing. What loses the game the 10/10 is just jankyness, bugs and some kinda bad game design at some points (especially around the second half of the game).\nI really really recommend this game even if youre a more casual gamer, definetly one of my favorite games.\n(Also sorry if i had a lot of typos im not a native english speaker.)",

        "review": "Dark Souls is a game that forever changed the way we view action RPGs. From the very first moments it attracts with its dark, enigmatic atmosphere that arouses fascination and anxiety. It's a game that doesn't lead the player by the hand - on the contrary, it throws him into a mysterious, harsh world where every encounter can be deadly and every decision is crucial.\n\nThe most impressive element of Dark Souls is its well-thought-out level design. The world of Lordran is an intricately connected network of locations that we discover step by step, full of hidden shortcuts, secrets and carefully designed challenges. This world has a life of its own - from deserted castles, through dark catacombs, to hellish depths, each element seems to have its own story. A perfectly balanced balance of difficulties and rewards makes each completion of a difficult part of the game a feeling of pure satisfaction.",

I feel like those elements are what kept me playing the first time even I wasn't the happiest. having learned the mechanics and letting them marinate in my silly brain, the game flowed like water, and I beat it in only a few days rather than like, 2 weeks. \n\nthis is probably a game you'll despise at first, then fall in love with the more you play. just give it a second chance, chosen undead. you won't regret it.",

But it may actually be! \r\n\r\nBefore i go on a rant, yes it is single player and it has online functions like CO-OP and PVP. Now the co-op is not what you might expect. You need to become human and place a mark so that another player interact with it and then he will come to your world on specific areas so that you both can play together. There is a PVP zone after the boss artorias.\r\n\r\nYou see, Dark souls 1/ remastered is a game that gives the player the freedom to choose where to go next with almost zero help. There is no Map and you will feel a bit lost at the start. (THE ENTIRE MAP IS ONE BIG MAZE).\r\nYou will try one area and then another one and you will see, maybe i am not ready to take on that path so i must choose another one. Luckly for you the first half of the game has a very linear path to follow.\r\n\r\nYou will rage quit, you will want to say \"this is totally not fair\", you will be frustrated. All this things are there because you don't understand the game really. Once you understand the game, how it works, how the animations work, how everything is connected and you know all the places and where to go, then this is a easy game. So with hard work the game will become easy. \r\n\r\nAmazing lore, but the lore is not given with cutscenes. Every item you will pick will have a story behind it. So always read the item description and learn more about the age of fire.\r\n\r\nGAIN THE COURAGE AND BUY THE GAME AND FINISH IT LIKE THE BOSS YOU ARE! If i can finish the game so can you!\r\n\r\nI highly recommend. Praise the sun.\r\n\r\n",

Still banned, decided to start fresh as a pyromancer to clear this one, got my nuts clapped many times over and over just to realise final boss is a Joke. The whole game is a mess if you come from newer titles, but like any soulslike it offers you the flexibility of feeling rewarded regardless of path you choose, regardless of way you move. Give it a try, but refrain from accepting items in online.",

You'll be a better person for it when its all over, more patient and determined. Good old Dark Souls!",

        "review": "After completing Dark Souls: Remastered, I have mixed feelings about my experience. While it has its standout moments, I found it less engaging compared to other titles in the series. The game can be quite confusing, often leaving players to navigate without clear guidance. I frequently relied on guides to find my way, which detracted from the sense of exploration I enjoy in other Souls games.\n\nThat said, the boss fights in Dark Souls are truly remarkable. Each encounter feels unique and challenging, pushing players to develop strategies and master timing. My Faith build, paired with the Mace, provided a rewarding combat experience, allowing me to deal solid damage while using supportive miracles. The satisfaction of triumphing over a tough boss remains a highlight of the game.\n\nThe world design is iconic, with interconnected areas that reward exploration—when you can find your way. The atmosphere is rich and haunting, immersing you in a dark fantasy that feels both oppressive and intriguing.\n\nOverall, while Dark Souls: Remastered has its brilliant moments, particularly in combat and boss design, the lack of clear navigation and its overall confusion left me feeling frustrated at times. It’s worth playing for fans of the series, but it didn't resonate with me as strongly as other entries.\n\nRating: ★★★☆☆",

        "review": "Let me tell u, Drak Soles Remastard aint juts a game; it's like a live-action documentary of my endless war against bed bugz. U think Gwynn, Lord of Cinders, is tuf? Try battlin' a horde of tiny blood-suckin' bastards every nite that turn ur bed into the battlefield of absolute dispare. The game sez \"Prepere to Die,\" but it realy means \"Prepere to Scratch Until U Bleed,\" because this game, like bed bugs, will smash ur soul into a million lil itchy bits of regret and torment.\n\nFrom the momment u hit start, it's like gettin’ in the rusty armer of a middle evil bug man, armed with nuthin but a brkn sword and a dream of vengence. Fog gates? More like it’s the layers of ur peese of mind gettin shredded, each new area filled with enemys more relentless than my aunt betsy on meth. U think Blighttwn is bad? Try layin back down at 3 AM with skin crawlin’ from the thot of those tiny legged demons skitterin' thru ur pillows like they're doin' the Macarena. Tomato soup.\n\nAnd the bonfires? Ha! They're as useful as that cheap bed bug spray the dollar store sells—it smells like victory, but ur just foolin’ urself. U spray, u pray, u burn all ur clothes in a fire that smells like ur shattered dreams, but every morning ur back to square one, bitten and pissed off like Ornstein and Smough jus tag-teamed ur sanity. As a girl dealin with this nitemare, it feels like there’s no escape—like even my hair’s a battlefield of itchin’ terror.\n\nBoss fights? Plz, fighting Artorias is just like tryna catch that one sneaky ass bed bug who’s smarter than u, dodgin' ur hits like he’s Neo from the Matrix, but it's not the Matrix, it’s ur bedroom and ur losing. The Capra Demonn? That’s like my landlord slammin' the door in my face while two mangy dogs (bed bugs) bite at my heels, and somehow the moon is involved because it totally makes sense.\n\nAnd let’s talk bout the Estus Flask. In Drak Soles, healing is like finding a clean shirt that hasn’t been tainted by the invasion of tiny invincible vampires. One sip and u think ur safe, but nope, those bed bugs, like the game’s enemies, keep on respawning and by the way why does everything smell like bananas in this world? You patch one hole, one bite, one infestation, and suddenly there’s a chicken doing the cha-cha in ur closet.\n\nIn the end, Drak Soles Remastard isn’t just a game; it’s a frickin' life philosophy, a manifesto of madness, an endless cycle of death, resurrection, and me just tryna sleep in peace for ONCE. It’s about refusing to give up, about getting back up no matter how many bites, no matter how many times u die, because the struggle is ETERNAL. And honestly, if I could just parry bed bugs like I do in the game, life would be almost manageable.\n\nSo here's my review: 5/5. Drak Soles Remastard is the perfect simulashun of a bed bug apocalypse—a punishing, itch-inducing mess-terpiece that makes u want more, even when u kno it’s terrible for ur sanity. Now where the hell did I put my sword and my sanity?",

        "review": "Experience – First Time\n\nSetting/World – 9/10\nStory – 8.5/10\nMusic – 9.5/10\nVoice Acting – 9/10\nGame play – 9/10\n\nOverall Review – 9/10\n\nPlot\nYou are an ‘undead’, traversing the dilapidated world of Lordran, which is long past it’s prime. After learning of your fate as the ‘chosen undead’, you must destroy the lords of the world, who have all gone insane and past their usefulness. \n\nReview\n\nWorld\nThe World of Lordran is what makes the game so awesome! When the opening cutscene ends, and the player is shown, he/she is seen rotting away in Undead Asylum, awaiting their fate. You start your journey from there. After defeating a few bosses, you are transported to Lordran, by what, I will not spoil. After reaching Firelink Shrine in Lordran, you are free to go where ever you want, you can go up to Undead Parish, or down to Blighttown, you can fight ghosts or fight skeletons, the decision is up to you, which is an amazing design choice for exploring the world. \n\nThere are only a few places in the game which will seem unfair, because it requires certain items which you can only get later in the game, or by chance.\n\nGame play\nAfter the world, the most impressive thing about the game was its gameplay. The shear number of options you have at your disposal is frankly mind blowing! You can go for str. build, or magic build, you can make a weapon divine or make it raw, you can have aux effect on your weapon, you can ascend you weapon to follow a path. The choices frankly overwhelm you when you are first starting out, but once you get familiar with it, it becomes a rewarding experience. \n\nThe same thing is true for your player progression, you are given choices on how to scale your player, which stats to scale. \nThe combat mechanics, although simple to understand like:  light attack, strong attack, parry, backstab, roll etc, never feels simple or easy to execute, because the world in which you have to use this is unforgiving, one wrong move, and you will be squashed like a mosquito by bosses 10 feet higher than you.\n\nThere are a lot more, but you get the idea.\n\nStory\nDark Souls has an interesting way of telling you the story, which is, by not telling it. The opening cutscene gives you background of the World of Lordran. After that, it is entirely up to you to discover, evaluate: what is your purpose in this world; what are you supposed to do in this world. The best way to understand the world is by interacting with npcs. I can’t write more, or it will go in spoiler territory. \n\nMusic\nAmazing Music!! The moment you start your game from Firelink Shrine, you are blessed with amazing music. The game does not have any ambiance music, which will seem strange at first, but once you realize that music is only used for boss fights, and some bonfires, you will appreciate it.\n\nVoice Acting\nThe protagonist does not utter a word, nor does the bosses in the entire game. You only hear voices of npcs, but what an amazing job their respectable voice actor did.\n\nOverall Review\nI loved the game!! I had only heard of dark souls before, watched a few videos, laughed at a few memes, but never actually played the game, because I had heard about its difficulty and nothing more. But after completing it, I can safely say, the game is much more than being difficult. It has depth, story, gameplay, music, all the things that makes a game memorable, and that is where I will end my review. I will remember Dark Souls, not for being difficult, which it is, but for being an amazing game.\n\nP.S\nSpoilers!! The player, after the end boss battle, will be given an option to prolong the age of fire, or start the age of darkness.",

Ranged combat ? \n\nTo sum up my whole feeling, it's just boring - None of the story is explained, main story things happen that are only maybe referenced vaguely in an item description, are hidden behind fake walls that you require a game guide to find ... the amount of the game that's like \"ok, so you ahve to do this obscure path like falling down right here, falling down over here ... that you would actually never find unless you looked it up - blighttown.... And major decisions that come down to a yes or no, that you only know the consequences of if you've already experienced them..... Most of the game is failing so many times so you know what's in front of you, rather what you can react to, how you can react ... \n\nI got to the gaping dragon boss battle, and just kept my distance and hit it twice every time it got stunned and .... that's how you beat the entire boss, no layers, no sequnces, no changes ... \n\nIm going from this to never playing a fromsoft game again lol\n** I bought elden ring and honestly, im telling you, do not buy fromsoftgames *** Somehow this game has better camera controls than elden ring - From the brief time playing elden ring i actually liked this game better \n\nHonestly a big thing killing it for me is how badly implemented ranged combat and weapons are and how many times it's absolutely required for you to stand there for tens of minutes widdling away at a base level enemy with a tissue paper bow and arrow system, the aiming is so bad, and there's just many different times where it's completely required to use and it's just so bad. There's a whole boss where you need to use ranged attacks and it's just boring, tedious, it's really just literally you're gonna stand there for 20 minutes pressing the same button, dealing with the very bad mechanics, like arrows hitting the wall in front of you because the hitbox and aim is incorrect and obstructed.\n\nI completely seriously do not recommend playing this tedious slop - just get elden ring - I bet that elden ring actually has a roll dodge implemented with the intention that you need to use it eventually \n\nI bought elden ring and it's also completely terrible",

        "review": "[h1] I Liked Dark Souls 2 More [/h1] \n[u]8/10[/u]\nYes, you didn't read that wrong, I did actually like Dark Souls 2 more then Dark Souls 1. Dark Souls 2 was my first ever 'Souls-Like' and even though its the most hated game in the genre, Its still my favorite one from the ones I've played. Call me crazy, call me masochist, but I don't care. Dark Souls 2 will always have a special place in my heart, despite all of its issues. I won't ever forget the first time I slayed a boss, after trying for hours, I won't ever forget the first time beating it. It felt like I truly achieved something. With Dark Souls 1 (Or Remastered, whatever) I was trying to replicate that feeling but it just didn't work for me personally. The entire game was too easy, except an area here and there or a boss or two. A lot of Quality of Life improvments were missing here which were present in Dark Souls 2 which I guess is to be expected since Dark Souls 2 is obviously a sequel. For example I wasn't a fan of not being able to fast travel between bonfires until you find a certain item, and even then you can't fast travel between all bonfires, only 'major' ones. In other words, there is a lot of running around in order to go from one point of the map to another. To be fair, there are a lot of short cuts that you can unlock and then use, but even then, much easier to just fast travel to a bonfire I've already been too. You can only equip 2 rings instead of 4, which felt strange to be honest. I love using a lot of rings in 'Souls-Like' games. There are more example I can think of but you get the point. Overall, not a bad game by any means, I enjoyed most of it and would easily recommened it for people who like 'Souls-Like' games but haven't played Dark Souls 1. It just didn't replicate that feeling which Dark Souls 2 gave me years ago, which is perhaps what I was looking for.",

Aside from clear \"we're outta time and gotta ship it\" fall flat in the very end zones (Dark Cave land and Fire burny-burny land), it's a flawed masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFROM can't make a true 10/10 game to save their lives, but each one is a 9/10 with something really special about it, and Dark Souls is the one where they really figured out the tone and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame the latest stuff in their portfolio has drifted away from the original design philosophy of this and Demon's Souls, but everyone ends up selling out, justifying it, and then gaslighting the fan-base about it anyway these days.",

Many of the gimmick fights felt like a waste of time (Looking at you, Bed of Chaos) and others were forgettable (Moonlight Butterfly).\r\n\r\nMy final thoughts are more retrospective, I'm glad to see the roots of the series and enjoy the gameplay elements that evolved after this installment.",

        "review": "There are lots of things to not like about Dark Souls. It is opaque, plodding, and will punish you relentlessly for making the same mistakes again and again. All those things give you a greater sense of achievement when you finally learn what this game is, and isn't, and learn to work that system to your enjoyment.\r\n The game is also very good at making sure you do not become complacent. New focuses and challenges will make you adapt quickly on your feet, or have to start from a minor progress loss where you have more time to think and determine your method of approach.\r\n Like most games from Japan, the accessibility factors are quite lacking. And that is incredibly unfortunate. I have a friend who is legally blind who can not play this game because of it's visual style and language.\r\n No game is for everyone. Dark Souls will do it's best to let you know early on that it isn't for you. But for those of us it is for, there's nothing else like it. Tread carefully, pay attention, and lean on the community.",

If i could tell you something to make your enjoyment of Dark Souls better it is this: don't look up a guide and learn on your own if you can, but if you NEED a guide get one don't feel pressured into a no guide run, enjoy this game your way.

        "review": "Explore incredible places far from the Mushroom Kingdom as you join DARK SOULS and his new ally Cappy on a massive, globe-trotting 3D adventure. Use amazing new abilities—like the power to capture and control objects, animals, and enemies—to collect Power Moons so you can power up the Odyssey airship and save Princess Peach from Bowser’s wedding plans!\r\n\r\nThanks to heroic, hat-shaped Cappy, DARK SOULS’s got new moves that’ll make you rethink his traditional run-and-jump gameplay—like cap jump, cap throw, and capture. Use captured cohorts such as enemies, objects, and animals to progress through the game and uncover loads of hidden collectibles. And if you feel like playing with a friend, just pass them a Joy-Con™ controller! Player 1 controls DARK SOULS while Player 2 controls Cappy. This sandbox-style 3D Mario adventure—the first since 1996’s beloved DARK SOULS II™ and 2002’s Nintendo GameCube™ classic DARK SOULS III™—is packed with secrets and surprises, plus exciting new kingdoms to explore.",

I also find it surprising that the community is so involved to this day on PC.\nIt's true that the mechanics have aged and can get annoying. It's not as refined as the other games FromSoftware, but that's forgivable because it's the first in the series (without forgetting demon souls).\nEven today, I find the environment frustrating and just unfair. It's dark souls, I guess... but that's what makes it so unique and good.\n\nremember the first time in Blighttown, so toxic\nremember the first panic attack facing an invader\ngetting executed for the 34th time by Smough's big booty\n\nwhat a great journey",

This game has a tone that just never came back in Fromsoft games aside from maybe Bloodborne. \n\nIt's definitely a little dated at this point, but it's a fuckin gourmet meal of a game. \n\nLike, dude, please just go play it. It's like, the GOAT of GOATs\n\nI'ma be real though, 40 dollars is kind of a steep price for a 60fps patch. Very little about the game was remastered outside of the framerate, and they delisted the original from the Steam store. That's pretty shady Fromsoft, pretty shady.",

        "review": "The game is... horrible, what the fuck they add some anti cheat and nerfed things but buffed others, that is somehow good, but WHAT THE FUCK IT IS THE SOULS FARMING AND THE ROLLING TOWARDS ENEMIES! the hitboxes, and the slow movement, I have prepare to die edition and it is a low more smooth with the mod fixing the problems, that seem they did not fix in Remaster, there are a damn Guide telling how they fix the control dead zone to really have a 8 directions in rolling... Seriously I have better being with Prepare to die edition. The soul farming I have complete almost all the game and I am underleveled, I am level 40.... level 40 the only reason I am beating it is the zwein and 2 hands, I started as a mage, and now I am forced to be a figther and piromancer, I know DS1 it has a lot of troubles to be a mage in first time, but it was a lot easier with high int, some vigor and str enough to hold a shield what also, it is failing the shields seem to be unable to block normal attacks for the hitbox, and rolling is glitched too, so the game is not forgiving for the casual. No wonder Ibai give up and keep only playing Elden Ring. it can be very frustrating, I am gonna go for the 100% but I really really REALLY! recommend the Prepare to die edition with the fix than this. well... there are fewer players there but lets be honest most people hate invaders, I have been invade like only 3 times and they are levels at least 200, but the worse part it is seem or is lag or they are doing something that make them immune to damage, when  I keep teleporting to a backstab.",

Most bosses have mechanics that are simple to learn, with a few powerhouses peppered in. The different areas are incredibly unique, from a forest on the edge of a dark valley, to a sunken city, to an undead town, to the city of the gods, to the essence of darkness itself. \n\nThe deeper lore is not entirely obvious at first, but by reading item descriptions and paying attention to the environment, a more connected story begins to form right before your eyes. \n\nThe builds are also incredibly varied. There are fast weapons, huge weapons,  ranged weapons, different movesets. There is also magic: sorceries, miracles, and pyromancy. \n\nAs you grow stronger throughout the game you prepare to take on powerful bosses to fulfill your goal, along the way you’ll meet both friend and foe, have fun and prepare to die",

Every step is so intentional, revealing striking vistas as you progress through each area. The world feels cohesive and immersive, fantastical and yet familiar in its austere brutality. The progression of the game feels organic, imbuing the player with a sense of belonging within the narrative, even as they are forced to make polarizing choices time after time. A truly unforgettable adventure. The puzzling mazes will force the player to take their time, and the rich texture they find when they do so will be all the more rewarding. Can't say enough about this game. Can't wait to play more from FromSoft.",

        "review": "The first time I played Dark Souls I had just dumped something like my 600th hour into Elden Ring and I was finally ready to take on the Souls series. I absolutely hated this game. The clunky movement, the ganks, the limited rolling when locked on, the simplistic bosses, and the runbacks and backtracking all contributed to the fact that the game just didn't click for me and I dropped the game soon after beating the Taurus demon.\n\nHowever, after beating Shadow of the Erdtree a couple of times I decided to give Dark Souls another shot on a new character, and after a small period of adjustment (as you'd expect, it plays much differently to Elden Ring) I was hooked. This time I wasn't spending my playtime being frustrated by dated game design or jank, but instead I found myself taking things slowly, observing and immersing myself in the world of Lordran, and overall playing the game a bit more tactically. This is, in my opinion, how Dark Souls wants you to play it. All the same core mechanics of a Soulslike are here -- the build variety, the dodge rolls, the stamina bar, the cryptic lore & NPC questlines, etc. -- yet there is a beautiful simplicity to Dark Souls. The game is honestly pretty relaxing coming off of Elden Ring and you're expected to be more careful in your approach rather than learn complex strings of inputs to dodge and punish equally complex boss combos and unleash powerful weapon arts of your own like in the later games.\n\nI personally have fallen in love with Dark Souls and it's an easy recommendation if you can overlook some of its flaws. The game isn't perfect (I'm not sure you need me to tell you that levels like the Tomb of the Giants and Lost Izalith can fuck right off) and if you've already spent a lot of time with other Souls games it might even feel a bit easy, but at its heart the game still perfectly exemplifies all the best qualities of the Souls series and I could see myself returning to it as a sort of 'comfort game'. Also, speaking to the remastered edition itself, I personally didn't have any issues playing through this version though I'm not savvy to any changes which may or may not have been made compared to the original release or PTDE. Overall, Dark Souls is a solid game and a good entry point into the series for anyone who might want a change of pace coming off of Elden Ring or who has no previous experience with any Soulslikes, though if you fall into the latter category you may find this game more difficult than I made it out to be.",

The locations are tedious and bad.It was so fun to run back and forth(No).The textures are so bad that 80% of my deaths were due to falling. The story is practically non-existent, and while the lore shows some promise, it doesn’t come close to the depth of something like Tomb Raider or even Mario DS. Dark Souls 3 is ten times better than this shit.I do not recommend to buy this game for anyone,especially for people who tried ds3 or elden ring and wants to play old souls game.",

        "review": "A timeless classic RPG that has the most wonderful world design and NPCs I've ever experienced in gaming. Most of the areas are super interesting and unique and there is just so much to explore and figure out as you go along your adventure. The DLC is fantastic as well and features some of the more ambitious and fun bosses. There are a select few unscrupulous sections such as Capra demon, Blighttown and Bed of Chaos that will make you ponder your life choices on your long runs back but overall the game is very fair and rewarding. While the bosses generally might not be the best the series has to offer (I think due to the \"slower\" combat compared to the other entries) the good ones are so iconic and memorable that they shine so much brighter than the stinkers. All in all, Dark Souls 1 has high highs and low lows and it really ties into the theme that there can't be light without darkness. It is a journey everyone should embark on at least once!",

I have never intentionally read any of the lore, but the story and world as I have experienced them through the game play always feel like I am immersed in a dream, like an ant slaying gods for the twisted amusement of powers beyond my comprehension. Well the joke is on them, I got the evil ending on accident!",

Something like this: 1-2 minute run, (half or less health, 2-3 flasks left), 10 second fight, repeat.\r\nThis alone ruins the fun and makes rage quit the game.\r\n3) Bad balance\r\nSkill/boss/weapon balancing is badly designed.\r\n4) Bad and forgetful music\r\n5) Atrocious UI design\r\nUI is designed by a madman for a madmen.\r\nPlus, you can accidentally strike/kill NPCs while talking with them or browsing goods...\r\nVery \"thoughtful\" design.\r\n6) Low framerate\r\nOnly 60 FPS. At least it's stable.\r\n7) Vague story\r\nOnly if you collect all bits and pieces, the story will be somewhat clear, otherwise it's so vague, you don't understand what is going on.\r\n\r\nConclusion: 5/10",

If you want to get better say at PVP, smart AI etc, this is the game for you but I can't stop mentioning it, this game is hard to the bone...play it I dare you >:-)",

What I don't like is that between each attempt you have to run several minutes to get back to the boss before it kills you again in a matter of seconds. It tries hard to be a \"hardcore\" game, but too often it means annoying limitations like not being able to pause or save the game instead of providing interesting challenges. Challenge is a good thing but the unfortunate bad design choices make it a boring game.",

I just opened a new game and found myself alone into this dark unforgiving world unlike anything I have ever seen before. \n\nI spent all the playthroughs holding my breath during fights and staring with awe at the majestic environment always wondering how is it even possible to concieve something so great. The way maps are interconnected with one another, the enemies behaviour, the weapons, the movesets, the sidequests, the way the lore is told have all given me one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.\n\nThank you, From Software",

Upon writing this review I have 28 hours logged in the past two weeks because it's just that damn good. The game will kick you 6 ways to Sunday and you will get angry and frustrated and confused and you will want to give up. But you can't. This game is entirely different to any other title you could play. Something just kept me coming back to this game every time, I was willingly throwing myself at a brick wall in hopes that this time I'd put a small crack in it. Nothing kept me going except determination, to conquer this game and see what came next. And when I did it felt so incredibly rewarding. I bought this game back in 2022 mainly just because I wanted to play Bloodborne and decided to start at the beginning, played on and off, made it the Depths in 2023, then just stopped. I only came back because I noticed it had been a whole year since I last played and decided to not let that 67 dollars go to waste, and I'm so glad I did. I realise I haven't really said anything specific about why I think Dark Souls is great, but it's something you just need to experience. Try it, get angry, overcome that anger, nothing can beat that feeling. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow.\n",

As for tracking us all the way from Reach, at light speed my maneuvering options were limited.\r\n\r\nKEYES:\r\n\r\nWe were running dark, yes?\r\n\r\nCORTANA:\r\n\r\nUntil we decellerated. No one could have missed the hole we tore in subspace. (pause) They were waiting for us on the far side of the planet.\r\n\r\nKEYES:\r\n\r\nSo, where do we stand?\r\n\r\nCORTANA:\r\n\r\nOur fighters are mopping up the last of their Recon picket now, nothing serious. But, I've isolated approach signatures from multiple CCS-class battlegroups. Make it three capital ships per group. And in about ninety seconds they'll be all over us.\r\n\r\nKEYES:\r\n\r\nWell, that's it then. Bring the ship back up to Combat Alert Alpha.

Please report to your action stations. (long pause. Jeep drives around. Camera follows it.) Fifth Platoon, secure airlocks on Deck Eleven. Fourteenth Platoon, rendezvous with 22nd Tactical at Bulkhead Charlie 14.\r\n\r\nSERGEANT:\r\n\r\nYou heard the lady.

Even if with no armor or weapons equipped, you will still feel like you're controlling someone tripping on cough syrup. Both from how slow you will be physically traversing the world and from just how much delay there is in action. Can't tell if it's a bug or a feature... Either way it's an insufferable way to play a game, where you die over and over again, having to run back to the boss room, which in many cases are no where near bonefires.",

The under lying mechanics are often found on the wiki instead of in-game so some studying is advised but not necessary. There are many play styles accommodated such as archer, mage, warrior, thief, and pyromancer(FFIIRREE!!!!). Weapons range from daggers, wands & staves to halberds & spears, can be 2-handed, dual wielded, or combined with a shield. Enemies are sufficiently varied in their attacks and visual designs, bosses are hard but beatable & memorable. Story is light with few cutscenes or npcs and can be mostly ignored but each npc & their quest are well done.\n\nIf you are willing to suffer a little, this game can be quite rewarding",

Yes, is it hard? 100% It is one of the hardest games to have ever lived but can be so rewarding and so fun to play. The story itself is a mystery as you have to uncover it yourself through item descriptions and small details within the game itself. Ultimately, it's a fantastic game and great for those who want a real challenge.",

Bought it about a year ago and didn't like it but after I gave it a fair and good shot it is very worth playing. If you have played other souls games like Elden Ring and DS3 this game isn't very hard but the level design alone is very good compared to DS3 which still has good level design be it very linear. Opening up shortcuts to bosses and then leading back to Firelink Shrine is so satisfying. Play the video game.",

        "review": "After playing Elden Ring, I wanted to try out the Souls series, starting with the first. I had heard about it's interconnected level design, it's atmospheric setting, and it's weighty combat. I was ready to see how awesome this classic is. But 34 hours later, and all I feel is disappointed.\r\n\r\nI think I should mention the good before I say why I gave a dislike. The biggest three things are the interconnected levels, the atmosphere, and the weighty combat. I have to give credit where credit is due, the way the map fits together is very smart. There was a lot of moments where I went \"wait, that's connected?\" and the mental map of Lordran became clearer and larger. The atmosphere was also really good. It felt cozy, almost like a fairy tale. And the combat felt a lot more focused than other titles. Unfortunately, that's where my praise ends.\r\n\r\nAs cozy as the game feels, it also feels cheeky. There are so many things in this game that feel like they're there because f**k you, that's why. There are countless minor and major annoyances in every area and every aspect that eventually you really start to feel it after a while. Obtuse stats, awful enemy placement, gankfests from even the weakest enemies, bizarre geometry interactions, ridiculous runbacks and travel time, you name it. Everything felt very unrefined and very unfinished. \r\n\r\nDespite all of this, I gave it a fair shot. I beat Ornstein and Smough and acquired the Lordvessel. Google says that's about halfway through the game, which I think is enough to make up my mind. But the game feels lacking in so many areas. Flawed masterpiece is the best way to describe this game. Because I can see the greatness, but it's hidden behind so many flaws that ultimately I have to say I disliked it more than I liked it.",

Not because I think it's the best, the other do a great job taking it in a new direction or being faithful to the original (i.e. DS2 and DS3 respectfully doing each) but this one takes up less space on my laptop that I've had since my last job where I was constantly traveling and couldn't lug a PC everywhere. The game play holds up and this has the QOL changes the game needed in a remaster. I just wish they could have kept most of the looks of the original but I ain't complaining to much when everything else is great.",

        "review": "[h1] Dark Souls, the best game I never played [/h1]\n\nThat is, until now of course.\n\n2011 was quite a year for gaming looking back. A quick google search and seeing the amount of iconic games that came out that year, and compare it to now, my god we had it good back then!\n\nAnyway, to get back to the point I'm trying to make, Dark Souls came out that year and it was a revolutionary game. Yet the Souls games are something I never dared go near. I'm not sure exactly why, probably mainly a fear of being bad at them, the seemingly overly difficult game play just wasn't my thing back then, and I was probably too stuck into Skyrim.\n\nI finally bit the bullet and decided to get into the Souls games as my brother was getting into Elden Ring, which I also bought but haven't touched yet. I wanted to start from the beginning (sadly Demon's Souls isn't on Steam.. yet), so I delved into Dark Souls: Remastered.\n\nWell I am so glad did play it. From the get go the world of Dark Souls captivated me, a world truly Dark indeed, for a game people say doesn't have much story, it absolutely does! The devil is in the details I guess.\n\nAnd yes, the game is tough. The game is challenging. The game can be difficult. But, the game teaches you to \"git gud\", it's a game of trial and error, dying is integral to the experience. It's so integral to the story as well. The world is dying and everything is relying on you not to give up, but to do better and succeed. And when you do succeed, it feels great. This is one of the few games I've really felt such a sense of pride and accomplishment (heh). I actually felt like I grew as a player lol.\n\nOne thing that amazed me was the world design. The interconnected-ness and when you first experience is top notch. I was blown away to take that elevator and end up back where I did. And the game has lots of little branches that bring you back to familiar spots.\n\nThat being said, I did have my fair share of frustrations at times. Certain areas, enemies or bosses [spoiler] (F*ck you Capra Demon) [/spoiler] will make you want to rage, and I'll admit that there were certain parts where I had to look up a video on just how I could possibly get past it. But the Souls-borne community is perhaps one of the best I have come across. And the meme culture around it all is absolutely brilliant. I love how the game has a lore explanation for the multiplayer as well.\n\nA lot of people have claimed that Dark Souls has a masterpiece first half, and a meh second half. I wouldn't go quite as far to call the second half bad, however, there are one or two areas [spoiler] (F*ck you Lost Izalith) [/spoiler] at the end where you can feel they had to wrap up development and therefore doesn't have quite the polish as others.\n\nThe DLC portion of the game was quite the jump up in difficulty, however this is not a bad thing. In fact the increase in challenge and setting of this DLC was probably my favorite overall.\n\nLastly, one of my favorite aspects of Dark Souls were the NPCs. I completely get why people love the characters that are present, whether it's Sun bro or the bumbling and loveable onion knight, the NPCs add so much to the experience even though they aren't exactly complex. I made sure that I completed each NPC's quest, and each of their stories really pictured just how bleak and how important it is to keep going.\n\n[h2][i] Too f*cking long, I ain't reading all that [/i][/h2]\n\nIn essence, Dark Souls is a true genre-defining game with excellent world building, level design, amazing game play, a surprisingly rich story for those who want it, and most of all a rewarding experience.\n\nI was so happy to experience, learn and master the game, I even set out to 100% all achievements which took me 2.5 playthroughs. It was well worth it.\n\n[h1] 10 / 10, 5 stars, chef's kiss, etc. [/h1]",

The combat was pretty slow so you can look at it as a good or a bad thing. The only thing I found underwhelming was the boss fights, they felt was too easy the mfs on the outside of the boss fights felt harder. I would still however recommend this game.",

The change to the bonfire makes it look more like DS2, but I preferred the ethereal look of the original. Make sure that you adjust in-game brightness as it seems to default to max after installing. It isn't awful at max but probably not intended. You also may consider running at 30 FPS as that is how most people originally experienced the game on console and PC and it affects both the cinematic feel and difficulty.\n\n10/10 GOAT",

        "review": "2024 Review from a person who has not played any of the actual Dark Souls games, but has completed all of Elden Ring and Sekiro.  I finished this one after 37 hours, taking my time.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated and the mechanics are a little clunky, but the game holds up.  The way the map is structured is amazing.  All of the levels loop around and into each other, so even though you don't get fast travel until fairly deep in the game it does not drag.  I did have to look up a map though from time to time as there is not one in the game and I didn't memorize all of that.  From a pure \"tracing back to the roots of what this type of game is\" perspective this one is worth playing.  I did play it on the steam deck for a decent portion of the time.\n\nAs for difficulty, I was surprised to discover that it was sort of easy.  I have completed Elden Ring + DLC and Sekrio so it may just be that I  have \"got gud\".  The combat is slower paced than those games but more deliberate.  If you press to swing your sword twice you better have meant it, because it is swinging twice.  The difficulty in this game was not really in the bosses in my opinion, but in the runbacks and the level parkour.  More of that later.\n\nOne of the things that does not get talked about much is the game's sense of humor.  Its the baked in little things, like only Rats have humanity.  For example, One of the first bosses in the game is fought on top of a rather narrow wall.  While fighting him, I turned him so that his back was to the edge.  When he jumped away from me, he jumped off the wall to his death; Victory Achieved.  Hilarious.  Other times the game pranks you, saying \"You thought one gargoyle was the boss?  How about 2?\"  And every character in the game is a terrible person with gallows humor (except for Solaire, he's the best), while some of the monsters are kind of chill.  There were literal times that I laughed out loud at the game and that does not get talked about much.\n\nWhat I did not enjoy was some of the more dated level traversal aspects.  Like Instant death or just a big waste of time associated with falling from a higher place.  Getting knocked off that higher place happens.  Also, there is no jump button; you have to be running and the press the run button again to do a jump.  In some places this is required.  Heck in the Bed of Chaos boss fight it is required over instant death pits.  Also, rolling and running while locked on is limited.  And some of the achievements are literally RNG based.  Overall I felt like this game was worth playing and finishing, but not something I'm going to be chasing everything in.",

I love the score and atmosphere built here. With a unique way of story telling that is occasionally very obtuse. Same with Dark Souls enemy's. Many of whom can be beat with a bit of patients. \n\nAll in all, I definitely get why this is a classic in games. \n\n9/10",

There's a ton of things to unlock and many bosses and areas to master.\r\n\r\nIf I could say something negative about this game is that there are clearly some parts of this game that didn't receive the same level of love and care as others, this becomes rather clear midway through the game. \r\n\r\nLastly, even though this is a remaster of an excellent game, I wish Fromsoftware could re-remaster this game again to take advantage of the latest tech in videogames such as ray traced global illumination, reflections and shadows or even better, do a remake but take care of the not-so-loved areas of this game and expand on what we have.

Now that I've played and 100%'d it, I can confirm that yes, the hype was real.  The gameplay is stiff and a little janky, like Demon's Souls, and the story is essentially throwaway (a bit like Demon's Souls... although I seem to remember it making more sense).  But the world is really immersive, for some reason.  The way levels wind back on each other, and the oppressive emptiness and \"deadness\" of the world really draws you in.  If you can stomach the old style of gameplay and want the challenge, it's worth it.",

        "review": "Dark Souls is a bad game to me which is really disappointing because of ll the hours I spent experimenting with the games systems and weapon variety. But first lets get bulk of why I think this game is bad, all the bugs, now I don't know how FromSoft got away with simply re-releasing the same so it could keep a £40 price tag but that';s what they did. Going back 7 years before the original game released the team had a lot more experience and now the time and funding to shine down onto the game giving the love it deserved. Except that obviously never happened and only makes me more mad at the game, nearly every bug stays in this remaster. This is a list of the bugs I have found via my playthroughs or watching other people run this game which could be made a point of \"well if you didn't find them it doesn't count\" but with this games age there is no way FromSoft couldn't of been made aware of them. Soul duping, chain backstabbing, if the centipede demon grabs you in the left hand corner he instantly dies, luring ceaseless discharge (real boss name) back to the fog to fall to his death weirdly, Ornstein's charge attack, hydra mini-boss will sometimes (seemingly randomly) stay forever in an idle animation, Capra demon skip which is way to long to explain but basically involves clipping out of bounds, Queelag skip also to long but involves death cam abuse, Asylum demon skip which is basically leaving the Asylum but without killing the boss, there are probably more I don't know about but this is what I saw in my time playing. Even looking past the bugs the games layout is just poorly designed being very cryptic to navigate through on first playthroughs to just annoying to get through after because of how long it takes to get to where you need to go. Unlocking shortcuts doesn't solve this issue and good luck finding them without a guide same goes for figuring out what to do, I have no problem figuring things out for myself but this isn't an exploration game and trying to solve the old-English npc's does my head in. I'd recommend watching a metric ton of videos on Dark Souls and not go to the wiki as it's just plain terrible (and sometimes wrong), to access the dlc area you have to reload the game 3 times beat half of the game then go back to the other half of the map. Whilst we are on the topic of design who exactly made these hitboxes and were they blind? Now I have no specific examples of this because I like to remember better things but my favourite moments would be lingering hitboxes, when my sword goes visibly through an enemy but does no damage and vice versa. There should have also been basic quality of life features here that where even in later FromSoft titles such as the ability to teleport between bonfires and fast climb ladders, doesn't sound important but Blight Town is almost exclusively ladders and there are some big ones else where like the hydra area. That's just why the game is bad as a remaster though so lets start with the opening tutorial and how it barely teaches the player. Admittedly if you are someone who has never picked up a controller before it does a decent job however I actually play videogames which is why I can't understand why the game never brings up equip loads. That effects your i-frames (obviously important) and in honesty in 80 hours playing the game I still don't really understand the scaling of weapon ratings. What is really annoying to me is how the game teaches you something wrongly, that is the importance of the plunging attack which past the tutorial and first boss you will never really get the chance to use but is made to seem important by the fact it does overwhelming damage to the Asylum demon. Here it also fails to mention what the stats but in fairness does a little but it would be nice to know that before I chose my character and weapon upgrades which is single handily why you can see the health bar move, but hey just figure it out right. At least there are a good variety of playstyles even if the combat is super slow playing out more like a turnbased game which makes me want to pull my hair out (really slow fighting). If you're  coward you can do sorceries or be a pyromancer and if you want to do 0 damage and hit nothing you can do a dex build. Getting my guy dripped out is actually where 90% of my fun lied with and the rest being from when the game wasn't tweaking out. You can make yourself look really cool and there are armour pieces for any kind of character you cook up or imagine lore for which helps with the rpg aspect. Enemies are everywhere on the map but respawn when you die and because I, as you can clearly tell, value my time always walked around and never grinded because neither of those are fun especially with the clippy hitboxes and some playthroughs having low poise. What's poise? Well play the game and find- oh yea it doesn't explain that either. I'll tell you this now walking back to a boss isn't fun and will never be (eventually FromSoft would figured that out) but what grinds my estus flasks are how I'm killing genuine god of death and dragons but when 3 rats jump me it spells instant death (stunlocking bs). Demons, centaur spider witches, massive murderous magma centipede, things that you have to kill yet I lose to the power of five guys, that's because of what I mentioned earlier poise which instead of being tied to armour should be based on resistance giving it a use while still making sense. This makes you funnel your level up points even more into endurance making every playthrough stats look the same, level vitality and endurance while putting points into your damaging stat with only magic runs slightly differing by putting points into attunement. I actually liked this samey feel as it made planning my runs a lot easier and because of how linear the game is. Not to say that traversal was easy as despite the shortcuts it will still take longer than you could ever want it to be to go anywhere, on my 4th run these ended up being counter intuitive as I no longer could remember how to go anywhere without them. I will never admit this to be fault as I am constantly conditioned into using them to save time, instead of having a progressive map constantly leading to new areas you have a spaghetti map where you keep having to backtrack through previously visited areas which is why I could no longer remember the original route. It's actually rather funny how despite all the bosses I ended up killing the hardest part was navigating this map especially on my first playthrough. At the very least these areas look different from each other and I was a fan of the variety between levels and boss designs, I think the concept behind Blight town and how it looks visually is very appealing it's just I could never really appreciate them as I always still bitter over the last 3 deaths eg where a guy hit my through a wall and knocked me down to my death. Then there are boss runs which FromSoft have basically admitted themselves that they're bad by removing them in Elden Ring, no one will ever like these and are just anti-consumer bs there to pad the game. Some can get lost in thought about what this world was like while exploring as you are left with only your thoughts from there being no background music, but that's boring so I played my own. Just because you can't convey your story doesn't mean I need to do that for you and the world didn't interest me enough to look past the surface of it. It is also really jarring going from peace serenity to holier than thou god smite thee, that's what the boss music is like and I do think the music itself is cool the game just doesn't build to it and never felt earned. Though the sound design is, nearly every object breaks and makes it' own sound effect, when you rest at the bonfire there is this soothing voice, running waterfall, etc the devs clearly had passion for this game and that's why I'm disappointed because there is clearly a driven team that works on this.",

The difficulty is challenging, but not too much like DS2, and is incredibly rewarding to finally beat that spot or boss you were stuck on. The weapons and armor are pretty great (DS3 does have better of both) and the level design is top notch, literally the whole map is connected into one giant map and areas connect back to each other! I haven't seen level design like this anywhere else and it's very impressive to me (literally the biggest factor to why this one is my number one with DS3 being a very close second). I love a good dark fantasy world and Dark Souls really scratches that itch for me. I definitely recommend this game, however if you want to ease into the Souls/Borne series, start with DS3 then come back to this one and if you really enjoyed them, torture yourself with DS2 (Bloodborne plays like DS3 but faster so for some that is an easier start). Finally, I give this game an 11 out of 10, I fucking love this game it is one of my all time favorites!",

Dark Souls definitely has less QOL features introduced later in the series and has a bit more of a focus on the game as a whole being difficult rather than the bosses. You need to be careful about where you go and explore areas for every advantage you can get--it's not as easy as picking up a club and spamming your dodge through everything.\r\nSome complaints about the game I might have (longer runs to boss rooms, no multi-directional rolling, etc) are ones that are fixed later in the series anyhow, so I can't really go out and shit on the game for that when it's mainly because it was Fromsoft's second time making a game like this (and apparently Demon Souls sucks).",

I am aware that it is an old game, but that is its downfall. I can see how this game may have been fun when it was first released due to the era of gaming. There were no real reference points, so the flaws in this game went a little unnoticed. But they are there, and they are big. Unfair enemy placement, bullshit hitboxes, and annoying ass boss runs ruin it. And before you tell me to \"get good\", all of the things I mentioned previously inflate the games difficulty artificially. They are not there to make the game \"hard\", they are just there to piss off the player. I can let these issues slide when it comes to the original release of the game, but not with the remastered version.",

Honestly, I really liked Dark Souls: Remastered. I liked it so much that I decided to get every single achievement in it. I really do not recommend doing that because some achievements are just a pain to keep track of. Thankfully, this game has cloud saving, so you can easily play this on your steam deck whenever you want. I am only mentioning this because Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 are both lacking cloud saves. This isn't the definitive edition of Dark Souls. Don't let that bother you. There really isn't any definitive edition of Dark Souls, the previous versions were pretty glitchy and had horrible performance in certain sections. This version fixes a lot of the glitches, however there are some new glitches introduced. Even if this game fixed all of those glitches, it still wouldn't be perfect. Some bosses are poorly balanced and really aren't as hard as they should be. Gwyn and Pinwheel are extremely easy despite being later on in the game.",

People often say that after playing one of the Souls games, they can never look at any other video game the same again. I don't care who you are or what you've heard about these games, if you are currently, or have ever, experienced any kind of depression, play these games - this one in particular I'd suggest. I highly recommend the video essay \"How Souls Games Save You\" by Daryl Talks Games, it delves into the psychology of this video game phenomenon and makes me emotional every watch by the end of it. Miyazaki and his team have created absolute artworks with these games, masterpieces, I'd go as far as saying even with their unique flaws. Play the Souls games - even Dark Souls 2 - die, fuck up, make a mistake, die again, fail, die again, and again, and again and again and again, then learn, overcome, grow, and most importantly:\n\nDon't you dare go hollow.",

With FromSoftware being more and more concerned with action gameplay, they've lost the soul of their design. Every boss offers something different; nothing is stagnant here, even in the worst bosses such as bed of chaos, I'd take that a million times over the infinite stamina, 90% of screen spamming bosses of Bloodborne and Elden Ring. While those games are still good, they completely lose focus of what this series really was, playing with conventions. We've played these games for years now and every new game is completely stagnant conceptually. I wish From would return to playing with their game design again. Bosses that question our morality such as Sif, exploration that actually punishes us with traps that can lead to instant death with a long and punishing checkpoint, these things make the game actually hard and more fun to overcome, not just some attack spamming boss.",

But Dex Builds also fuck Strength Builds! And if they didn't fuck the Strength Builds, you know what you'd get? You'd get your sword and your catalyst all covered in shit!",

        "review": "Dark Souls is a classic game that I decided to finally try.\n\nOften when I complained about the difficulty of a game, I was told that the game was inspired by the difficulty of Dark Souls.\n\nAt some point it seemed to me that if I completed Dark Souls, I would get the key to passing other difficult games.\n\nSo what is Dark Souls about? This is not a difficult game. There are very few truly difficult parts here at all. But this is an unfair and inconvenient game. The game constantly deprives you of comfort, comes up with inconvenient rules to make you curse. All forces are thrown against the player, so you should not expect any heroic adventures and fair 1 on 1 battles. The goal of the game is to humiliate the player so that he throws away all honor and valor, and also begins to play dishonestly, using every opportunity to win.\n\nEnemies in the distance? I'd rather shoot them with a bow. Do your enemies fight painfully? I will wrap myself in the strongest armor and upgrade my shield. Is there a gorge nearby? I will lure the enemies there.\n\nAnd once you understand this philosophy, the game becomes trivial.\n\nThe worst enemy is distance. If you think this is a fighting game, then you are mistaken. This is a walking simulator. You will go through each path of this game at least a couple of dozen times. The first ten - after death, the second ten - collecting secrets in the surrounding area.\n\nThe strongest boss is the one whose path is the longest and most difficult. The easiest boss is the boss where you are resurrected after death.\n\nDo some games say they're hard because they want to be like Dark Souls? Fools, this only means that they will cause you discomfort.\n\nBut the game definitely deserves attention. There is a huge world here that is incredibly interesting to explore.",
