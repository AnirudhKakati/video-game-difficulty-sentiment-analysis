A mechanic where you hold a button, the sound gets all muffled, colours get all muted, and interactible objects and enemies are highlighted. Sound familiar? \n\nI didn't think it would be a big deal, and after getting through the combat tutorial and getting extremely excited for the wide variety of fighting mechanics, I figured I would press on!\n\nUnfortunately \"Witcher Vision\" was INTEGRAL to solving multiple quests in the small amount of time I continued playing, and I'm personally just not interested in spending future countless hours using this cliched and tired feature. It's extremely lazy from a game design perspective to rely this much on a mechanic like this. And it's extremely unimmersive to have to play. \n\nNeed to find a key to leave a room? Activate \"Witcher Vision\" and the key is highlighted!\nNeed to find a character when they aren't at home? Activate \"Witcher Vision\" and follow their glowing red footprints!\nNeed to solve the mystery of the noonwraith at the well?

        "review": "Beautiful; the best RPG I've ever played. The story is just so compelling. The locations, the characters, the visuals, the writing, the voice acting, the music... everything together wraps you up in a cozy immersive world that sinks its claws into and doesn't let go. It's unforgettable. \r\n\r\nThe way the story is structured feeds perfectly into the gameplay loop as well. Every quest has some story behind it, and seems to have some weight or impact on the world. It's never \"go kill thirty of this shitty monster and collect their nails and bring them to me\" or \"Go get this item\" or \"Follow this NPC for fifteen minutes\". There's always a real sense of place and purpose. Small quests go with small stories, big quests with big stories, and everything in-between. It all feels connected somehow. The basic gameplay loop is you do main or secondary storylines until you're too underpowered, then slow down and explore a bit, taking witcher contracts or random side quests and kind of getting lost in your surroundings. Eventually you realize you're pretty beefy and get back to the main quest again. It all feels very seamless and natural. \r\n\r\nOf course, there are problems, too. Quirks, let's say. Horseback-riding is hilariously bad, and the combat isn't great either, to be honest. Worse, for some reason they made the unforgivable decision to add unskippable voiceovers before loading into the game *and when you travel to a different region*. This gets extremely cumbersome in the late game when you might want to stop by different areas to do different things in quick succession. Also, for some reason the late-game voiceovers end with like fifteen seconds of silence where you're just staring at a static image -- probably some issues with localization. To top it off, they didn't even get a good voice actor for it! Anyway, yeah there are some bugs and some issues  but it really didn't take much away from the experience for me.\r\n\r\nNow that I've finished it, I feel like I've just finished an unforgettable book; I have that feeling of loss like I miss the characters and the world already. Maybe I'll come back and play it again at some point.\r\n\r\nWith that, here are some tipsters for people who decide to play:\r\n- I played on 'Blood and Broken Bones' difficulty. This is the correct difficulty. Any easier and the game wouldn't push you to learn and use its unique mechanics. Any harder is probably, well, too hard for the admittedly simplistic combat system in this game.\r\n- The game feels too hard in the beginning, average in the middle, then easy in the end. Idk why. In that beginning phase, take the time to learn the game mechanics, because they're weird. Use your oils. Brew your potions. Read the bestiary. Soon enough, you'll be cruising.\r\n- Steel for men, silver for monsters, coin for your Witcher!",

There's hundreds of hours worth of content to go through if you're not just aiming to blast straight through the main campaign and fast travel everywhere, and I would recommend you don't, just take your time and enjoy the game for what it is, as you'll never play anything quite like this (unless Witcher 4 is similar).\r\n\r\nAnd Gwent! One of the most addictive side activities / card games I've ever seen in an RPG, gotta catch em all!\r\n\r\nIf you haven't played this game, you're seriously missing out.",

If someone enjoys 50 hours worth of story gameplay, excluding side missions, alone, then they will love this. I like the medieval environment, and the characters are interesting. Sadly though, the game just was not for me, but I get why so many love this game and for that. I'll recommend it to those who would enjoy long stories, and decent combat with a few bosses here and there, and you'll enjoy it A LOT more if you have already read the books, and/or watched the series.",

Great voice acting and very interesting. Smaller story lines with sub characters are also more interesting than one would expect.\nCombat is 8/10. Good for an action RPG, but it's no elden ring. Locking on is frustrating when facing multiple enemies. \nSense of exploration is 6/10. Having everything marked on the map severely hinders the feeling of exploration. I would have preferred none of the points of interest to be marked and there to be no level requirement for equipment. That way finding good equipment would actually mean something in terms of both exploration and power upgrade, instead of the game telling you that you have to wait until it's essentially nothing special anymore. If you're willing to venture into harder areas and can get through it, you should be rewarded with something good that you can use or at least a schematic for something good to allow you to craft and use it if you can get the materials.",

Graphics - 2018, while it shows its age; environment and overall is really good. Character art takes a bit to get used to, higher the visual settings the better (I know, I know; we're gamer dorks, we knew this!). In my defense; Nanna won't know if she chooses to play for the first time! Mic drop! Luv U, Nanna. Oh, another question mark on the map; got to go!",

        "review": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterful open-world RPG that sets the standard for storytelling, world-building, and gameplay. Developed by CD Projekt Red, the game follows Geralt of Rivia, a skilled monster hunter, on a personal and epic quest to find his adopted daughter, Ciri. The narrative is complex and mature, offering morally gray choices and rich character development that make each decision feel consequential. The world is vast, alive, and meticulously crafted, with diverse regions, hidden secrets, and a dynamic ecosystem that invites exploration and discovery.\r\n\r\nCombat is satisfying and strategic, requiring players to plan ahead by using a variety of abilities, potions, and weapons tailored to each enemy. The game’s depth extends beyond combat with numerous side quests that rival the main story in quality, offering personal, engaging tales that add layers to the world. Geralt’s relationships with characters like Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri evolve based on player choices, making every interaction meaningful.\r\n\r\nVisually, The Witcher 3 is stunning, with breathtaking landscapes, detailed character models, and dynamic lighting that makes the world feel alive. The soundtrack complements the atmosphere perfectly, while the top-tier voice acting adds depth to the characters. With its rich storytelling, engaging gameplay, and emotional resonance, The Witcher 3 remains one of the greatest RPGs ever made and is a must-play for fans of the genre.",

Although released on 2015, it still holds up very good up to this day because of how much of a masterpiece it is.\nThe storytelling, the quests or contracts, the freedom to do whatever you want in the Witcher world and many more shenanigans is how this game hooks you in. It really shows how much work and devotion the devs put into this game. \nReally looking forward to the next iteration of the Witcher game.",

The Witcher 3 is for anyone who likes:\r\nMeaningful choices\r\nUnique, memorable sidequests that nearly all leave an impression\r\nFighting Monsters\r\n\r\nWitcher 3 has one of the most fleshed out and fulfilling worlds to play in and theres a reason people still constantly go back to it.  Really the only kind of rpg enjoyer who wouldnt like it is anyone who struggles with making difficult decisions, doesnt have the time for a massive open world (though it is one that respects your time) or anyone terrified at the idea of seeing a but cheek.\r\n\r\nLong live Ciri.",

        "review": "TOSS A COIN TO YOUR WITCHER\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (Next-Gen Edition) Review\n\nWhen The Witcher 3 was released in 2015, it quickly established itself as one of the most beloved role-playing games of all time. With its immersive storytelling, sprawling open world, and deep character development, it captured the hearts of players and critics alike. Fast forward to 2022, and CD Projekt Red delivered the Next-Gen Edition, updating the game for modern consoles and high-performance PCs. This enhanced version revitalizes an already outstanding game, adding visual polish, quality-of-life improvements, and even some new content. But does it still hold up nearly a decade later? Spoiler alert: it absolutely does.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY (10/10):\nThe gameplay of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is where the game’s unique blend of action, strategy, and RPG elements truly shines. CD Projekt Red has created a near-perfect balance between storytelling and action, and this is where the game establishes itself as a genre-defining masterpiece. At the heart of The Witcher 3 is its real-time combat system, which is a mix of strategic swordplay, magical signs, and alchemical preparation. Combat is quick, fluid, and requires constant adaptation to your enemies. Players have access to Geralt’s two swords—one steel for humans and non-magical creatures, and one silver for monsters—along with a crossbow and a variety of bombs. Geralt’s swordplay, which focuses on dodging, parrying, and timed strikes, feels more refined in the Next-Gen Edition thanks to the improved frame rates and smoother animations. One of the game’s unique features is its magic system, based on the use of signs. These magical abilities, like Igni (fire), Quen (a protective shield), and Aard (a telekinetic blast), offer a dynamic layer of strategy. Every encounter can be approached in various ways, and mastering the right combination of swordplay and signs is essential, especially on higher difficulties. Alchemy also plays a critical role in Geralt's preparation for battle. From crafting potions that enhance his abilities to brewing oils that deal extra damage to specific enemies, it’s a feature that rewards careful planning. Some fights can be brutal without the right alchemical preparation, and the deeper you dive into this system, the more rewarding the combat becomes. No review of The Witcher 3 would be complete without mentioning Gwent, the in-game card game that has become a phenomenon in its own right. Gwent is a tactical deck-building game where players face off in a battle of cards, trying to outsmart their opponent by building a stronger hand. It’s surprisingly addictive, with an impressive depth that allows for many strategies and deck combinations. In fact, Gwent became so popular that it was eventually spun off into its own standalone game.\n\nGRAPHICS AND ATMOSPHERE (9.5/10):\nThe most striking improvement in the Next-Gen Edition is the graphical overhaul. With ray tracing, higher resolutions, enhanced textures, and better lighting, the world of The Witcher 3 has never looked better. The landscapes are breathtaking, from the war-torn fields of Velen to the majestic city of Novigrad and the vibrant islands of Skellige. Every inch of this open world is teeming with life, offering stunning vistas at every turn. The weather system and day-night cycle are more visually impactful thanks to improved lighting and shadow effects. Rainstorms now feel even more ominous, and the sunsets are simply awe-inspiring. The atmosphere, aided by the enhanced visuals, pulls you into the world in a way that very few games manage to do. However, despite the improvements, The Witcher 3 still suffers from a glaring issue: the reuse of NPC character models, especially faces. This has been a long-standing critique, and while not game-breaking, it detracts from immersion when you keep encountering the same faces in different roles across the vast world.\n\nSOUND AND MUSIC (10/10):\nThe Witcher 3's sound design remains one of its most celebrated aspects, and the Next-Gen Edition only serves to highlight this further. The game's score, composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz, Mikolai Stroinski, and Percival, is a masterpiece of orchestration. The music complements every aspect of the game, from the heart-pounding battle tracks to the serene, melancholic tunes that play while wandering through the open world. The blend of traditional Slavic instruments with modern compositions gives the world of The Witcher a distinctive sound that sticks with you long after you’ve finished playing. Ambient sounds, from the creaking of wooden doors to the distant howls of monsters, are meticulously crafted, creating an immersive auditory experience. Sound effects, too, are top-notch. From the clashing of swords to the eerie growls of monsters lurking in the wild, everything sounds authentic and contributes to the immersive atmosphere. Voice acting is another high point, with Doug Cockle's gruff portrayal of Geralt remaining iconic. Supporting characters, such as Yennefer, Triss, and Dandelion, are equally well-voiced, contributing to some of the best dialogue in any RPG. \n\nSTORY AND CHARACTERS (9.5/10):\nStory is nothing short of epic, spanning hundreds of hours if you dive into every quest and side activity. At its core, the game is about Geralt’s search for his adopted daughter, Ciri, a child of prophecy with the power to shape the world’s fate. However, the story is layered with complex political intrigue, emotional character arcs, and deeply personal quests that make every decision feel meaningful. From Geralt’s love interests, Yennefer and Triss, to supporting figures like Vesemir and Zoltan, each character is deeply fleshed out, with their own motivations, histories, and relationships. Villains such as the Wild Hunt are menacing and enigmatic, but it's often the morally ambiguous choices and the lesser-known characters who leave the biggest impact. The writing remains sharp, with quests often presenting morally gray situations that challenge the player to make tough decisions. Whether dealing with a cursed village or navigating a high-stakes political plotline, the game excels in crafting meaningful narratives.\n\nGAME LENGTH AND COMPLETION TIME (9/10): \nOne of the most remarkable aspects of The Witcher 3 is its sheer content. The main storyline can take around 50 to 70 hours to complete, depending on your pacing. However, for those who wish to experience everything the game has to offer, including side quests, Gwent matches, monster hunts, and the two critically acclaimed expansions (Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine), you're easily looking at over 180 hours of gameplay. While this vast amount of content is generally a positive, it can also be daunting. Some players might feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of side activities, and certain quests can feel like filler, especially if they deviate too much from the main plot. Still, the majority of the content is rich, engaging, and well worth the time invested.\n\nCONCLUSION AND SCORE:\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (Next-Gen Edition) is a masterclass in storytelling, world-building, and RPG design. The graphical improvements make an already stunning game even more beautiful, and the gameplay refinements bring it up to modern standards. Despite some minor critiques, such as the reuse of character models and the occasionally outdated dialogue animations, these issues pale in comparison to the overall brilliance of the game. This is a game that rewards exploration, patience, and investment, offering one of the richest, most immersive worlds ever created in gaming. Whether you're a returning player or experiencing Geralt's journey for the first time, the Next-Gen Edition is the definitive way to experience this legendary game.\n\nSCORE: 9.4/10\n",

I originally disliked the combat, but once it clicked... It felt good and satisfying taking down a group of bandits or a huge wyvern. You cannot ignore the mechanics and tools the game presents to you -- everything has its use, and that's neat design. The writing feels faithful to the books, and I'm just as invested in the side content as I am the core plot. It's clear that this is one of the greatest RPGs of its type out there.\r\n\r\nI will say that the game is a lot more streamlined with the application of 3 mods: Fast travel from anywhere on the map, no weapon degradation, and encumbrance removal. The latter two just aren't fun in any game (in my opinion), unless you're wanting something more realistic/simulation-like. \r\n\r\nA neat touch is the addition of a 'Steam Deck' preset in the graphics options. I've been going back-and-forth between Deck and PC and it's a fantastic, seamless experience. 10/10 optimization.\r\n\r\nI think I paid ~$10 for this + all the DLC. But it's easily worth full price.",

I continually felt hand-held and could never get over the hump of the first ten hours that made me feel like a robot fetching this, talking to one person or another, killing a few monsters. I think this is the perfect example of the kind of game that you probably should not trust my opinion on if you're a story-loving gamer. I guess in short I'd rather play a game with fun gameplay mechanics and challenging obstacles out of the gate than watch a bunch of random people talk.",

Honestly, its a whole new experience to play it first-hand even having known most of the plot. \n\nThe story is definitely simple yet compelling as well as even the side quests (which you should not skip -and i don't think you will do such a thing !), allowing the player to get a feel of a satisfaction somewhat similar to putting together jigsaw puzzle pieces, along with the bigger picture; the end result which is based off many decisions made along the way. \n\nI also could definitely not forget to appreciate the beauty of the landscapes. The open world exploration is massive and truly immersive, being able to investigate into this dark fantasy world 🌄🐺🌌 of the Witcher.\n\nLastly, I should mention that I did take a 3 month break due to not being in the mood (this is before I realized all of the points stated above properly as well) but I've returned and to my surprise, now I can definitely say that it's my favorite 💞 so in conclusion, please don't hesitate to play this game!",

        "review": "I’ve played The Witcher 3 since the day it launched, across multiple accounts, and after all these years, it still stands as the best game I’ve ever played. From the captivating story to the vast, beautifully crafted open world, everything about this game feels like a masterpiece.\n\nThe characters are unforgettable, with Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri feeling like old friends at this point. The story is rich with emotion, tough choices, and surprises, and no matter how many times I replay it, the world of The Witcher always pulls me back in. Every corner of the map is filled with detail, side quests feel meaningful, and the soundtrack is a perfect fit for the atmosphere.\n\nThe combat is engaging, the exploration is rewarding, and the sheer depth of the game is unmatched. I’ve sunk hundreds of hours into it, and I still find new things to enjoy on every playthrough. If you haven’t played The Witcher 3 yet, you’re missing out on what is, in my opinion, the greatest game ever made. A true masterpiece that only gets better with time!",

        "review": "[h1]Gameplay experience[/h1]\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt delivers an exceptionally smooth and engaging experience. Its controls are very easy to use, making it accessible to both newcomers and experienced RPG players. The gameplay is perfectly balanced, offering a mix of combat, exploration, and storytelling that feels fair and consistently rewarding.\n\nPlayer engagement is very high; you’ll often find yourself fully absorbed in Geralt’s quests, thanks to the game's deeply immersive world. Decision relevance is also quite meaningful—choices in the narrative and gameplay have real consequences, impacting the world and the characters around you. Progression is highly satisfying, especially as you develop Geralt’s abilities and uncover new gear throughout the journey.\n\n\n[h1]Presentation & Immersion[/h1]\nIn terms of presentation, The Witcher 3 excels in every way. The storyline is extremely interesting, with rich character development, complex politics, and deeply emotional arcs. The atmosphere is completely immersive, whether you’re wandering through vibrant cities or the eerie wilds.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning, with breathtaking environments and detailed character models that remain impressive years after release. The audio quality is equally exceptional, from the powerful soundtrack to the immersive sound effects and voice acting. The HUD is very friendly and polished, offering a clean, functional interface that enhances the overall experience without overwhelming the player.\n\n\n[h1]Design & Technical Aspects[/h1]\nThe game design is masterful, with well-crafted mechanics that blend combat, magic, and alchemy into a cohesive system. The content quality is abundant, with a massive open world filled with diverse quests, monsters, and locations to explore. Every corner of the map holds something unique, making the game feel rich and alive.\n\nAI behavior is excellent, with enemies and NPCs reacting intelligently to your actions, adding depth and challenge to combat and interactions. The game’s settings are flexible enough to allow customization, though they could offer a bit more granularity for advanced players. The game is also nearly flawless in terms of technical issues, with minor bugs being rare and often addressed through updates.\n\n\n[h1]Final Considerations[/h1]\nThe overall satisfaction with The Witcher 3 is extremely high, as it provides one of the most polished and content-rich experiences in modern gaming. There are no microtransactions to detract from the experience, allowing you to fully immerse yourself without additional costs.\n\nThe game’s replay value is high, thanks to its multiple endings, expansive world, and deep narrative branches that encourage replays. With its excellent cost-to-play ratio, The Witcher 3 delivers incredible value for its price, offering hundreds of hours of premium gameplay.\n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr][td]Gameplay Experience:[/td]    [td]23 / 25[/td][/tr]\n    [tr][td]Presentation & Immersion:[/td]    [td]25 / 25[/td][/tr]\n    [tr][td]Design & Technical Aspects:[/td]    [td]24 / 25[/td][/tr]\n    [tr][td]Final Considerations:[/td]    [td]23 / 25[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h3]Exceptional: 95 / 100[/h3]\n",

        "review": "If you're a fan of the fantasy genre, this game is at the very top of the list. Even after nearly a decade, I still consider it my favorite game of all time. Despite its age, it holds up incredibly well.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is deeply story-driven, with every quest and side quest offering a compelling narrative. The DLCs only enhance the experience, and it's clear the game was crafted with passion and care.\n\nHearts of Stone is my favorite of the two expansions. Its story is powerfully emotional, and the final quests keep you on edge.\n\nI can’t see why anyone wouldn’t pick this up, especially since it’s often on sale for a bargain price.\n\nIf you're hesitant, just buy the game. You'll fall in love with it, I can almost guarantee it.",

The attention to detail is astounding, with hidden treasures, quests, and lore tucked away in every nook and cranny, encouraging players to explore every inch of this beautifully rendered landscape.\n\nThe combat system is fluid and engaging, combining swordplay with magic (known as Signs) and alchemy. Players can customize their abilities, creating a playstyle that suits their preferences. The variety of enemies keeps combat fresh and challenging, encouraging players to adapt their strategies. Whether you’re slaying monsters, engaging in fierce battles, or navigating political intrigues, the gameplay is consistently rewarding.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not just about the main story; it’s packed with a plethora of side quests, contracts, and activities that add depth to the experience. The two expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, are masterpieces in their own right, introducing new characters, storylines, and locations that rival the base game. Blood and Wine, in particular, is a perfect example of how to expand a game’s universe, providing closure and depth to Geralt’s journey.",

It’s like Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings, which not only met but exceeded expectations, creating a new canon, especially in terms of visual design. In short, The Witcher 3 is what an RPG should look like when brought to perfection.\n\nOf course, The Witcher 3, like any game, has its flaws, but all of them are minor compared to its predecessors. It’s logical that in the third part, the developers addressed previous shortcomings and improved upon them. However, in the gaming industry, it’s not uncommon for things to go the other way, as seen with the infamously disappointing Dragon Age series.\n\nI won’t go into the details and merits of The Witcher, because they’ve already been written about countless times. Just a simple 10/10.",

You play as Geralt, a badass monster hunter, in a massive, open world filled with magic, politics, and tough choices that actually matter. The story pulls you in, but it's the side quests that really stand out—each one feels like its own little adventure. The combat’s fun, the characters are memorable, and the world is just gorgeous to explore. Whether you're slaying monsters or getting wrapped up in wild stories, there's always something cool to do. \nWait, did I mention G.O.D.? what a dude, gave me chills haha...",

        "review": "Being the third and final installment of the Witcher series, this game is an epic conclusion to the adventures of the most popular witcher. As in the two first games, you play the witcher Geralt of Rivia, however, in Witcher 3 you have a great open world to explore in contrast to a closed area or linear map as in the predecessor games. The main story deals with the Wild Hunt and Geralt and associates searching for Ciri, who bears a crucially important power.\n\nThe sophisticated main story with its authentic main and side characters and diverse dialogue options is extremely well written and hooks you from the start. I have so thoroughly enjoyed it that I felt somewhat empty and even a bit sad when I finished it, as I knew there was most likely no other RPG being able to deliver something comparable to this marvelous adventure. Sometimes I wish I could forget the main story and play it all over again. Choices made during its course do not only determine the destiny of single characters, but also the future of whole empires. Next to the main quest, The Witcher 3 offers side quest plots that can be experienced before certain events during the main quest and that add a lot of immersion to the world. Most quests offer you different choices and give you the feeling that there is no absolute evil or good, but many shades of gray in an overall harsh world. In my opinion, the only subject that required more attention was the background story and motivation of the main antagonist.\n\nThe open world in which this RPG takes place is massive and filled with innumerable smaller side quests. Next to standard side quests, the witcher might also solve problems regarding monsters in special contracts to earn additional experience and funds. The developers have put in tons of effort to create and design as many diverse and interesting monsters as possible, which all have an entry in a bestiary and require a different strategy to be beaten by the witcher. For example, this means that you should brew certain potions to be able to effectively combat various monster types. Furthermore, you can enhance your witcher’s abilities by spending skill points on a diverse set of skills that can all improve your strength. These features increase the immersion of playing as a mutant human that the witcher actually is and thus increase the joy of playing as a true witcher. The very satisfactory feeling of character progression through the course of a playthrough is reinforced by finding and improving an armory set from a witcher school of your own choice. The cities and settlements and the people living in these feel quite vivid, however, you can sometimes notice that the open world and most of its inhabitants can often be more accurately described as a theatric scenery than a consistent and organic world that could also exist on its own. The open world felt quite bland and empty here and there, giving the impression that size mattered more than quality.\n\nThe two DLCs of the Witcher 3, Hearts of Stone (HoS) and Blood and Wine (BaW) are both absolutely worth it and actually handle my two main points of criticism quite well: the main antagonist and the open world. While HoS offers only little with regard to exploration of new areas, its story telling and main antagonist, who I would describe as the best written main antagonist up to this date, are the focus points of this expansion. BaW is an expansion that focuses on all strengths of this game and creates a more believable open world that is smaller, but more densely packed with quests and interesting characters. Basically, BaW is a better version of the main game just with smaller proportions. I highly recommend both DLCs to everyone who has played the main game.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is probably the best RPG of the 2010s and one of the best and most memorable RPGs of all time. Everyone who enjoys sophisticated story telling and an authentically written dark and ruthless world full of questionable human beings and dangerous monsters will wholeheartedly enjoy this game.\n",

After you craft a oil / potion / bomb you don't need to re-learn the recipie to craft more you just learn it once then after you meditate if you have I think it's strong alcohol? ( might need confirmation here ) it automatically refills all potions / bombs / oils ( you have learn't so bought or found the receipie for and crated the item once ) \r\n\r\n2.  Make sure your markers are set to \" all \" on the map page this will help you  navigate\r\n\r\n3. Collect everything you can - some vendors give you more gold then others ( I tend to stick to bigger cities ) \r\n\r\n4.

Yes\nVisuals-Great\nStory-Great\nCombat-ok.far from the best for such a good game,but its good to not make me insane.\nMusic in game-Really Great\n\nDoes a rtx3060 12gb i5 12400f 16gb 3200mhz really make maximum settings+raytracing at a good FPS??\nNo i get 30fps\n\nWould i recomend the next gen version of this game for lower hardware?\nNo\n\nGet the v1.31 instead that runs great on my oldest pc---Gtx1650  i5 9400f 16gb 2666mhz\nRecomend to get the HalkHogan Graphical mod w this verision(looks almost as good as N.Gen+Its used in the Next gen)\n\nWarning!!\nDont play if u dont have time(save it for a day u can spend 24/7 in this game until u finished it!\nThe above might just be me though!?\n\nThis is the closest to LOVE a game so far,I cant wait to see whats the next release from CDPR will be like\nSo Get this game and play it n have a good time\n\nMust Have!\nBlood And Wine DLC\nHearts Of Stone  Dlc   its a must have.Both of them\nBut if low on cash--Get the base game only(it will give u alot of hours for the amount it costs)\n\nKeep on Gaming!",

        "review": "I have bought this game three times across three different platforms simply because it is that good. My time played on Steam does not account for the 100+ hours I dedicated to the original game on GOG. The story is compelling, and all of the characters are well done. While the combat and some of the gameplay itself aren't the best ever done, it does its job well enough. I would recommend increasing the difficulty for more immersion. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and the dialogue is believable. I did mod some annoyances out of the game, such as weight limits, etc. The DLCs are more impressive than the base game, especially Blood and Wine, which is larger than other games that are more expensive. This is a must-own in every library—simply one of the best games of all time.",

Now this is coming from someone who has played and finished Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 at the time of their release so I could expect what I was getting into.\r\n\r\nI took quite a while starting this game as I delayed it till it next gen graphics update and I would say that it was worth the wait. This game has so much to deliver that it completely justifies its cost. Maybe over-justifies at as well.\r\n\r\nThe character development is simply amazing. The story progression is emotional and pure adventurous. And finally I get to see Yennefer in action as I was reading lore logs in the previous games mentioning her. \r\n\r\nIf you have played the previous games like me then you would have more context on some of the events of this game. But this is nothing to worry over, as the game was designed so that it would not alienate new players as it summarizes past events in the game logs for you. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this game to any RPG lover. Its one of those games that you need to experience as a gamer.",

Conclusion?\n\nThe undeniable king of adventure RPG games set in an opened fantasy world, which, even after 9 years, can still make a huge impression.\n\nThis is the kind of game that, after finishing, leaves a void in us that we would love to fill with the next part of Geralt of Rivia's adventures.\n\nDefinitely well-deserved GOTY of 2015. Hats off to CDPR.",

This major update literally allowed me to complete the game for the second time because now I can play it on my non-gaming laptop, which doesn't even have a dedicated graphics card. I have a Ryzen 5 4500 laptop with a Vega 6 graphics core, and thanks to DX12 and FSR 2.1, I can play the game at 30-40 fps in 1280x720 on a basic office laptop. That's insane! I also encountered a \"missing water\" issue, but it was resolved by upgrading the video drivers. This means the world to me right now, after selling my gaming PC and being left with a work-only laptop.",

There can be invisible walls at times and after a shipwreck happens you may want to check to see if you can save or not otherwise you may find yourself losing a lot of progress (for myself I lost 30 minutes worth). I found myself not trusting the dotted line you follow for quests and trusting the yellowing indicator more. I had an interesting time with the Witcher games, so much so I went out and got all the books to do a comparison. Between the Netflix show, the books and the games I would say the games are the best form of Witcher entertainment. I did the main story in about 35 hours so the game has some length to it but isn't as long as some make it seem, worth checking out!",

Everything - including the lengthy epilogue with Regis, the part when Geralt looks and slightly smiles into the camera, and the visit from Triss (at least in my playthrough) was just done beautifully and provided a really satisfying sense of closure. It was great to see Geralt's friendship with Regis develop more over the course of Blood and Wine, it was great to see him finally get his long-deserved peace, retiring in his Toussaint home.\r\n\r\n-- ( + got all Achievements )\r\n \r\n",

        "review": "Fantastic game. DLC are worth it. I bought it on a sale ages ago, and haven't been able to put it down since. If you like period fantasy set in a more medieval-leaning age, lots of magic, cool sword-fighting and combat training arcs, this might be the game for you. Great mechanics. Dark subject matter, but it's done so beautifully well through the lens of a flawed protagonist.\r\n\r\nOne thing I particularly appreciate is that Geralt can often choose peaceful resolutions, with a little extra effort. The times where he can't, I understand why peace wasn't an option.\r\n\r\nContent warnings I can think of off the top of my head (Spoiler warning: If you want to go in completely \r\nblind, don't read.):\r\n- Naked people (Naked ladies, Naked Geralt, there's nakedness of all flavors. Unavoidable. Hard to skip through, as the nakedness is often accompanied by context and lore.)\r\n- Sex scenes (Completely avoidable and skippable. Don't flirt too hard with any of the characters, and don't follow the Yennifer/Triss paths too hard.)\r\n- Unborn baby monster (There's a particularly gruesome monster in this game for a questline that broke my heart, and it was so well done, but I know that could trigger a Bad Time™ for some folks, so into the content warnings it goes.) (There are ways to peacefully handle this questline though)\r\n- Themes related to grief and trauma (The writing really goes for as much of the whole scope of the human experience as you can get. We've got rape victims, we've got abuse victims, we've got young soldiers dying to combats run by disconnected leaders, we've got people finding solace in each other as the only light in war-stricken lands, we've got children affected by war and hunger and loss, we've got children growing up too fast or never even getting the chance to live- Man the list just goes ON. That's not even to MENTION the religious trauma themes present throughout the whole game. The game can get really heavy and sad, and not all the questlines get a happy ending.)\r\n\r\nAll in all, fantastic game. Amazing. It is a JOURNEY. I highly recommend it, but only if you're in the headspace for the above-listed themes.",

It serves the game well, because the fighting isn't necessarily what makes this game good. It's the different environments, the stories and the soundtrack. There's always something new to discover, and the game pushes you to become better and use the correct tools to move forward.\n\nI would say this is nearly a perfect game, and such a huge improvement to the first two games.

The environments are diverse and stunning, the monster fights are challenging and varied, the story (I'm including Main, Side, and Contract Quests in that) is engrossing. Combat flows fluidly and is very satisfying. I'm obsessed with the music and sound as well! I've gotten lost in plenty of games before, but there's something special about this one.\r\n\r\nMy only gripes: minor QoL complaints about some of the menus (why can't I equip a freshly crafted item so I don't have to exit the shopkeeper menu, equip the new item, and talk to the shopkeeper again to resell my old gear?), the fact that the music will sometimes cut out while you're sailing...that's not so bad on foot or on horseback but there's not a lot else going on when you're sailing, and (the big one) the sensitivity of the left analog stick and the fact that there's no setting to change that. Geralt moves like a god of death and vengeance in combat, but stumbles around like a drunk when trying to pick a flower (and Roach isn't much better). I have died more times to ledges without railings than I have to monsters.\r\n\r\nStill...the fact that this borderline gamebreaking issue doesn't break the game for me (I'm writing this review at nearly 124 hours! Coming for you, James Franco!) is a testament to how strong this game is overall. Firing on (almost) all cylinders across all disciplines!",

Its narrative and atmosphere offer an immersive role-playing experience that completely draws you in. While I accept that this may not be a true RPG, it does a great job of making you feel like one, making it impossible to miss that aspect. The game world is filled with intriguing characters, many of whom have depth that makes the consequences of your choices resonate.\n\nAfter the Next Gen update, the visuals have been perfected; Every detail contributes to the creation of a fascinating world. Rich natural landscapes, complex cities and character designs make this universe feel truly alive. Additionally, side quests aren't just tasks that need to be completed; Many of them have their own story and character development, adding depth to the game.\n\nMusic and sound design enhance the atmosphere, making the experience even richer. As you wander through the Witcher universe, music enhances emotional moments and makes the environment more interesting.\n\nIn short, it would be a great loss not to experience this legendary game.\n\n*Note: I have completed it before on non-Steam.",

        "review": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt transcends mere escapism; it offers a profound retreat into a solitude that feels like rediscovering clarity. There’s a certain wisdom in Geralt’s solitary wandering—a tacit acknowledgment that sometimes, solitude isn’t loneliness but liberation. In Geralt’s journey, we glimpse Cioran’s musings on the absurdity of existence, where life’s weight becomes bearable because it’s accepted, not resisted. The game doesn’t resolve the chaos of the world, nor does it offer easy answers—it revels in moral ambiguity and existential bleakness, making the escape all the more meaningful. Like Cioran, who saw despair as life’s backdrop, The Witcher 3 crafts an escapism that doesn't seek to deny reality but to confront it with detachment. Here, the solitude of the path sharpens focus, and clarity arises not from solving life's riddles, but from accepting that they never had answers in the first place.\n\n10/10.",

        "review": "Great game, liked it even more than Red Dead Redemption 2.\nThe story is not any way bad, its simply undescribeable how good it is, definitely got better since The Witcher 2.\nFighting is great, somewhat similar to the previous game, but with a few nice tweaks and this time featuring gore.\nWell written characters, some of them are from the previous games and some are new added, and finally some of the mentioned ones are now actually in the game and you can interact with them, even in a few definitely \"funny\" ways if you know what I mean, especially that unicorn lol.\nLiked the graphics, new-gen got the things even better, but thats more of a preference, although done quite well.\nSoundtrack is an absolute fire, fitting the time and sounds great so far, special thanks to everyone who contributed in the creation of it.\nVoice acting is fine, sometimes emotionless but story doesnt feel bad because of it, characters got some sense of humour which can never be bad, guess it didn't go without the improvisation of voice actors themselves too.\nChoices definitely matter in this game, alot of options make you think everytime before actually doing something because each choice leads to different consequences.\nEven though the game is open world it's quite empty, I liked going around the Skellige island though, about the NPC's here for now, each region features different cultures, makes the game world feel somewhat immersive too, even though you can't really talk alot with any of them and they're mostly just walking around or doing something, but there definitely was a few good additions to the story with a few folks.\nAnd finally, after the previous game this one actually is open world, worth to mention, as I wrote in my The Witcher 2 review, running around for quests was hell, in this one it was not a problem anymore, since there is alot of ways to get to your destination now.\nThis masterpiece is absolutely \"must play\", The Witcher 3 will definitely stay in my memory for long and I would always think of this game positively.",

I played this game for like a month and fully completed it and boy that journey was worth it.\r\nHonestly you don't play this game you live it and now when its finally time to part with this game, I feel a sense of emptiness in my heart.\r\nThis game was very dear to me. LOVED IT,\r\nBut not to worry I still haven't played witcher 2 yet, so I might give that a shot or will probably start a        new game+.\r\nSo folks plz go and enjoy this lovely masterpiece as a game like this only comes in a decade.\r\nKudos to the CD Project Devs. thank you for making this wonderful game.\r\n",

If there's one reason to play this game, it's Anna Henrietta, the ruling duchess of Toussaint in the \"Blood and Wine\" expansion. Her story bits are really entertaining and rememberable.\n\nBeyond that, there's the clunky base game with invisible walls, insurmountable obstacles, glitches, highly repetitive and tedious gameplay as a requirement for character progression. Your horse Roach photobombing conversation based cutscenes, bears dropping from trees, Geralt plunging into the water headfirst especially when you try to reach the shore, 3rd person virtual camera positioning trouble while fighting flying foes, and and and...\n\nOverall, it's highly playable of course, but character skilling choices and gathering of equipment is rather dull.",

Horse movement is locked to camera instead of where the horse is facing which is also completely cursed.\n\nEdit, it's the nvidia hairworks crashing the game every 10 minutes.",

        "review": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – 9/10\nStorytelling (9/10)\n\nStrength: The narrative is rich, sprawling, and deeply rooted in the lore of Andrzej Sapkowski's novels. It gives players a personal, emotional connection through Geralt’s relationships, especially with Ciri and Yennefer. The way quests interweave with the main story and have consequences for the world is impressive.\nCritique: However, the sheer scale of the narrative often dilutes its impact. For all its grand storytelling, The Witcher 3 can feel overburdened by its side content, some of which drags down the pacing. While side quests are often deep and interesting, the pacing of the main story suffers as a result. There’s also a reliance on fetch-quests that, while well-written, still betray the open-world RPG grind that can take away from the narrative urgency. The game tries to be both personal and epic, and sometimes, it struggles to balance the two.\nCharacter Development (8/10)\n\nStrength: Geralt is an iconic protagonist, and the character arcs of Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri are well done. The choices you make impact their fates, making it feel like you’re directly involved in shaping their stories.\nCritique: Geralt, while fascinating, can feel static. His emotional range is often limited to gruff stoicism or sarcastic detachment. While this is true to his character, it limits emotional depth. Compare Geralt to someone like Solid Snake or Arthur Morgan, who evolve emotionally throughout their respective narratives—Geralt’s character arc, while engaging, doesn’t hit those same high notes. Characters like Eredin and the Wild Hunt themselves feel underdeveloped, despite their central importance to the plot, and suffer from being one-note villains.\nWorld Design (9/10)\n\nStrength: The Witcher 3’s world is breathtakingly beautiful and immersive. From the rolling fields of Velen to the bustling streets of Novigrad, the world feels alive. The attention to detail in the environment is unparalleled—villagers go about their day, animals roam, and the weather changes dynamically.\nCritique: But, much like with God of War, the open-world design can feel repetitive. The “?” markers littering the map are a double-edged sword. While they encourage exploration, they often lead to repetitive tasks (clearing out monster nests, finding treasures, etc.), making the world feel mechanical at times. Skellige, while gorgeous, can be a chore to traverse, and the lack of a more intricate fast-travel system or mount mechanics slows down the exploration.\nCombat (7/10)\n\nStrength: The blend of swordplay and magic (signs) is engaging, and Geralt’s ability to brew potions and prepare for combat makes the experience more tactical than a typical hack-and-slash.\nCritique: Yet, the combat system is one of The Witcher 3’s weakest aspects. It’s clunky, repetitive, and lacks the depth of truly great RPG systems. The hitboxes are often inconsistent, and dodging/parrying mechanics feel less fluid than in more refined combat systems like FromSoftware’s titles (think Dark Souls or Sekiro). For all the depth the game tries to build into the combat with oils, potions, and signs, it often boils down to repetitive dodge-and-slash tactics, especially on higher difficulties. Compare it to the meticulously designed combat of Miyazaki's games, where every encounter feels like a strategic dance—The Witcher 3 feels more like a grind.\nVisuals and Atmosphere (10/10)\n\nStrength: The game’s atmosphere is one of its greatest achievements. CD Projekt Red excels at creating a world that feels lived-in and vibrant. The dynamic weather, day/night cycle, and environmental details like villages recovering from war create a sense of place that few games achieve.\nCritique: While visually stunning, the game’s art direction can occasionally feel too polished—lacking the grittiness or rawness found in more thematically darker titles. For a world rife with war, famine, and death, there are moments where the visual style feels too clean or too fantasy-romanticized, missing the opportunity to dive deeper into a more visceral atmosphere.\nPacing and Structure (7/10)\n\nStrength: The narrative is divided into acts, which provides a clear structure and a natural flow.\nCritique: The game’s pacing is inconsistent. The first few hours are incredibly engaging, but once you hit the mid-game, the structure begins to sag under its own weight. The back-and-forth nature of certain quests, especially in Skellige, can feel like a slog. Some of the side content, while robust, clutters the main narrative drive and breaks immersion, leaving players oscillating between rich story moments and tedious tasks.\nLegacy and Innovation (8/10)\n\nStrength: The Witcher 3 redefined what an open-world RPG could be. The quality of the writing, world-building, and player choices raised the bar for narrative-driven games. Its post-launch support, especially with expansions like Blood and Wine, was top-tier.\nCritique: However, the game doesn’t feel as revolutionary today as it did at launch. In retrospect, the combat and RPG mechanics show their age. While The Witcher 3 excels at creating a narrative-heavy RPG, it borrows heavily from earlier titles (like The Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age) and fails to push boundaries in terms of gameplay mechanics or world interactivity. There’s little true innovation beyond its brilliant storytelling. Compare this to a Kojima game like Death Stranding, which, for all its flaws, challenges the player’s expectations of what a game can be—The Witcher 3 feels like it plays things too safe in comparison.\nFinal Verdict: 8/10\nThe Witcher 3 is undoubtedly a genre-defining RPG, but viewed through the lens of Kojima or Miyazaki levels of innovation and risk-taking, it doesn’t push the boundaries far enough in key areas like combat design or world interaction. The story and world-building are stellar, but the gameplay mechanics feel clunky and dated by today’s standards. It excels in creating a beautifully realized world, but it lacks the gameplay depth and radical design choices that would elevate it into the realm of true masterpieces. It’s a brilliant game, but it falls short of greatness in a few crucial areas.",

        "review": "Oh, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt! Where do I even begin? It's like all the best parts of a fantasy novel smooshed into a video game, and then a friendly bard comes along to sing you songs about it while you kick some serious monster butt! I mean, who hasn’t wanted to experience a little sword-fighting action while simultaneously trying to woo every NPC in sight? Let’s be honest, I’ve spent more time flirting with barmaids than actually doing any monster hunting, but hey, Geralt’s charm is hard to resist. Besides, those hearty meals and greasy tavern conversations keep my character well-fed for all the monster-slaying ahead—multitasking at its finest!\r\n\r\nNow, let’s talk about the world of The Witcher 3. It’s so vast and beautifully crafted that I sometimes wonder if I’ve stumbled into an enchanted version of Google Maps. You’ve got lush forests, treacherous mountain trails, cities bustling with ridiculous side quests, and let’s not forget about Skellige—the place where even the sea monsters skip leg day! Seriously, this game has everything but a hotdog stand at the corner. It's jam-packed with quests that feel less like “fetch this” and more like “holy moly, did I just find the key to curing an entire village of plague?!” Pro tip: always keep a few potions handy because you never know when a side quest is going to go from friendly picnics to “oops, I accidentally unleashed a swarm of hungry ghouls.”\r\n\r\nI can’t recommend The Witcher 3 highly enough to anyone who enjoys RPG adventures! If you love an epic journey filled with rich lore, complex characters, and the occasional decision that leaves you questioning your life choices (thanks, Ciri), this game is your cup of tea—or should I say, cup of potion? So gather your friends, don some armor, and get ready to dive into a world where your choices matter, your horse can outsmart you, and you’ll be humming bard songs for weeks. Trust me, once you start slaying monsters and getting tangled in political intrigue, you won't just be playing a game; you’ll be living the fantasy!",

Well worth it to pick up, even if you've never gotten into witcher content before. Highly recommend!!!",

        "review": "The Witcher 3 is an excellent game. The story, writing, explorable world, and variety of encounters is exceptionally well done. Its hard to believe this game is almost 10 years old now.  The addition of the DLC packs is relatively seamless and greatly enhances the entire experience. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous.  \n\nThe cons: \n-I hit one or two bugs early game that disappeared as quickly as they appeared and have not been seen since. For example suddenly for no reason Geralt would not dive under water. I had to save and reload the game from the main menu.\n-Completionists should be warned, you will have to spend 150 ish hours to achieve everything. It never feels tedious though, except for Skelige where you will find yourself sailing between floating treasures and dispatching the sirens.\n\nIf you havent played this game, you are missing out. There are some things that newer games do better, but if this game was released new today, I dont think anyone would know it was 10 years old.",

Trying again later for the third time, I stuck with it, and I don't regret finishing the game. Main story and both DLCs are great, I think I finished all of the side quests too, some were better some were worse. There is too many points of interest on the map and getting them all is very repetitive; especially the Skellige underwater ones are huge pain and should be avoided. All in all, great game that I can recommend to any RPG lover.",

It makes you lose into its mystic and very few games can do that. Missions are a pain in the ass , even when you choose the easiest difficulty but its rewarding. Women are beautiful and if you are into an open world game with mystic , magic and women , this is it.",

        "review": "The Witcher 3 is the GOAT when it comes to gaming, one of the best game ever made. A superb RPG.\n\nThe game has at its core as protagonist one of the most baddass character ever made-a veritable gigachad: Gerald of Rivia \"the White Wolf\" a witcher which is a mutated human with enhanced abilities that hunts monsters for money. The plot of the game takes Gerald on an epic search for his adopted daughter: Ciri, who is on a run from the Wild Hunt: a group of Aen Elle elves( also known as Wraiths of Mörhogg) because of her Elder Blood abilities. \n\nThe game shines best at storytelling offering deep, engaging narrative with multiple dimensions characters, top-notch voice acting and most important give the player the ability to make choices which have consequences. The game has so many side-quests some which are so incredibly well done that put to shame, embarrass most games main plot. \n\nThe combat is very fluid and dynamic with swordplay(silver swords for monsters, steel swords for humans), range attacks-crossbow, magic and alchemy. Different monsters have different weaknesses so the player has to use some tactics-different combination of signs and potions upon inspecting the Monster Bestiary to help him gain the upper ground. \n\nThe game next gen visuals are some of the best I have ever seen in a fantasy videogame: comes with  4k textures, great LOD and ray traced global illumination, ambient occlusion, ambient occlusion, reflections and shadows. The scenery, the landscapes, towns, forests are just breathtaking. Often I found myself taking breaks and just admiring the sights. Took more then 100 screenshots.  \n\nThe game offers some of the most detailed, big, expansive, immersive open world I have ever seen. The world feels alive with its great diverse environments(medieval cities, villages, military encampments, abandoned towers, forests, mountains, sea), dynamic weather, day-night cycle with some of the best sunsets and sunrises, a great variety of NPC's, animals and monsters that roam the world and make it all feel more immersive. \n\nThe soundtrack is also another part where the game excels offering one of the best work of Marcin Przybyłowicz a Polish composer. Every time I listen to \"Wake Up Ciri\" or \"Aen Seidhe\" or \"Silver For Monsters\" or \"Steel For Humans\" I get goosebumps. \n\nThe game also features a nice complex crafting system where you have Armorsmiths and Swordsmiths which help you create some of nicest, coolest and baddass armors sets I have ever seen in all my gaming experience, my favorite being the Ursine School Gear. You need to loot and collect certain items, find Diagrams and dismantle things for materials. \n\nAnother big surprise was the game mini-game: Gwent-a card game which is so well done and fleshed out that it feels like an entire game altogether being better and more fun then most AAA games of today which are boring and superficial.\n\nOverall the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterpiece of a game with great narrative elements, some of the most complex characters, immersive world, great visuals and soundtrack, addictive gameplay and one of the best mini-game ever. \n\nThe game deserves every penny it asks for and even more. If you have never played the game I advise to do it at the most immediate occasion. \n\nI would rate the game a 10 out of 10. \n",

        "review": "The Witcher 3 is hands down one of the best story-driven RPGs out there.\r\nThe character development is deep and engaging, making each interaction meaningful and immersive. The main campaign offers around 100 hours of gameplay, yet it never feels like a chore. The exploration and side quests keep you hooked with their rich narrative and world-building.\r\n\r\nThe Blood and Wine DLC, in particular, stands out with its captivating story and breathtaking landscapes that stay with you long after you finish. Overall, The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, and for anyone who loves a dense, lore-filled RPG experience, this game is an absolute must-play.",

        "review": "The Witcher 3 is, bar none, the finest game I have ever played, and the game that was essentially my introduction to gaming. I started playing it in 2019, on the Nintendo Switch. 720p at best, 30 FPS, and gods it was a joy in every sense of the word. Even in that tiny handheld I could sense the majesty of the story, the sweeping landscapes, the characters. It is a story that has so much heart and so much emotion, that it bleeds through. I did not understand then, naive little me, just how profoundly it would affect me. I did not spend my time exploring every corner of the map, finishing every side quest, uncovering every treasure. Why, I barely had enough cash most of the time to upgrade my armour. And you know, in some ways, perhaps I lived the true witcher experience. Destitute and always on the path, ever onwards. Or so I like to tell myself.\n\nI do not enjoy open world RPGs, but I think this game does it best. An engaging story, a wonderful world filled with dangers and secrets, and a cast of characters delightful in their own way. It took be two years to finish the game on the Switch, slowly weaving through the rich narrative that had me overjoyed and weeping. As far as introductions to an entire hobby go, I don't know if I could have done better.\n\nAnd then, there are the DLCs. Both of them were included in my purchase, and I think they are worth the price even if they were not. A whole new story, even more wonderful characters, and perhaps one of the most terrifying antagonists I've ever encountered in a game, goodness! Of the two, I had yet to finish Blood and Wine, which I finally have now that I have the game on Steam.\n\nLook, the truth of the matter is, I don't have enough words to say how amazing this game is. It moved me emotionally and convinced me of the artform of video games. It showed me a novel way to tell stories and it showed me how it can immerse and engage you in ways so many other mediums never could. Cannot recommend it enough.",

        "review": "I don’t get why this game is so hyped, having heard countless praises about its immersive story and cool characters. Unfortunately, my experience fell far short of expectations. \n\nI tried to play it like four times on PlayStation and PC and dropped three of them. My fourth walkthrough was just to put a check to my checkbox that I passed this game on the death march difficulty, but it provided little satisfaction.\n\nIt is not a bad game, but mediocre. Compared to other open world games like RDR 2 it feels remarkably dull, and this is its biggest problem. You would say “But there are hundreds of side quests and activities that are not your regular Far Cry outpost shit!”. Yes, side quests, while numerous, often felt like tedious fetch-and-carry missions that didn't add much to the overall narrative and didn’t feel satisfying.\n\nAs for open world action games – there are better options, as for RPGs – there are better options. I honestly don’t understand how this game could become so popular and hyped. And lots of people call this the best game they ever played.",

Near limitless stuff to do and explore, with decently sized maps and a wide catalogue of enemies to fight. Have spent 60 hours and have barely grazed Skellige, which is impressive as hell as most games I've played I've finished in significantly less. The combat is smooth once learnt properly and is overall a fun experience. 10/10 would recommend.",

The game's biggest strength is it's storytelling and exploration with plenty of side quests to keep you busy.\n\nI do recommend installing quality of life mods particularly additional fast travel points, improved horse controls if using keyboard (it's much easier with a controller), cheaper respecs, and no fall damage.  There are also plenty of cosmetic mods available.\n\nPlaying this game 10 years after release but still an enjoyable experience, especially with the next gen patches and mods installed.",

        "review": "To start off if, you do not want to read a long thought out review to this game, I will skip to what the conclusion of this review will be. If you want an amazing in depth story with a ton of opportunity for immersion, I recommend this game 100%. If you are on the fence about buying an old game and want all the pros and cons that I can think of, look no further because this review will adequately cover most of the shortcomings and peaks of this game. I will be breaking the review up into sections as to not confuse myself and give clear concise points to specific areas of the game you might be wary about.\r\n\r\nStory/Immersion - If you are a person who really loves to put yourself into the shoes of the protagonists of video games, Geralt of Rivia is truly one to get immersed in. This game has inspired me to read most of the Witcher books and look into the story of the previous games solely because I enjoyed the character so much. As you learn more and more about the world and lore you are experiencing in the game, it leaves you wanting to know how it all led up to this point especially if this is your first exposure to anything Witcher, like it was for me. Not saying you need to read all the books and know all the previous games to enjoy the story of this one. This story could be a standalone game and still make sense, but if you are like me and love knowing stories of side characters and the history they have, then you might dive right into the universe of this game. And another thing that makes the story enjoyable is you really can play it how you want. There are multiple endings throughout most of the quests with a ton of opportunities for dialogue that you get to choose and shape your interactions. Whether it be a funny, serious, or just cruel choice, you can shape how you want your Geralt to be. \r\n\r\nCombat Mechanics/Gameplay - I decided to add this category because I would argue this to be one of the games major downfalls. Not to give it too hard of a time because you can truly have a lot of diversity with combat experiences. There are 5 different signs you can use, along with crossbows, potions, decoctions, bombs, swords, fists, etc. With that being said, the combat is not the most polished in the game, Albeit satisfying in a ton of instances, the sponginess of most of the bosses and cheesiness of some of the enemies make some combat interactions just plain dull or miserable. I played my entire playthrough on Death March difficulty ,which is the hardest in the game. Some of the creatures are just annoying, some were so buggy to where they would either eat my hits without damage or glitch through my dodge or block and just one shot me anyways. After completing the main story I set my difficulty lower to see if it was just a problem with Death March and even after lowering I still found myself not enjoying most of the combat. To give it some positive light, it is very satisfying to slice enemies in half with an overhead strong attack of decapitate with a light. Even though the combat is janky, I would not say it is cause not to play the game. It is still playable and at times enjoyable. Another slightly smaller grievance is the camera for the combat. It is a little too fixed and at some times you can't get it to where you want it to be pointing and during a fight,this can be frustrating. Overall I would highly recommend to still look past these and enjoy the experience.\r\n\r\nExploration/Content - I have put over 100 hours into this game at the time of writing this review, and the amount of exploration and content is pretty spectacular in the game. Granted, I also wanted to 100% the game so I enjoyed many of the side quests and different story arcs the game offers. I believe at the time of me completing just the main story and most side quests pertaining to the base game, I had put in close to 70 hours of the game. The last 30 hours put into the game was for two DLCs which are both actually really enjoyable. Blood and Wine being the best in my opinion, but when you play them both, you can decide that for yourself. With that being said, I can start my game right now and still I have a ton of areas I can explore on the map, tons more side quests, and I'm sure more armor, sword, and other customization to explore. And that is with over 100 hours of gameplay. Games like these are my favorite because I can just get lost in doing nothing at all with the main story and still play for hours while enjoying my time on it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, my honest review for this game. It is an underrated gem. This game does receive praise I'm sure, but I don't think it gets as much as it should especially for it being almost a 10 year old game. I would pick this game over most modern games without a second thought. If you are looking at this game and it is on a sale, I would implore you to give it a shot. Between tons of content, a gripping story, and just a beautiful game in general, you can not go wrong with this one. Thank you for reading the review and hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about buying this game.\r\n\r\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - 9/10",

Many times for many hours. It just won't hook me up like The Elder Scrolls, Uncharted, The Last of Us, Kingdoms of Amalur or even Diablo (1-3). It feels like it's all about the story / the narrative that is supposed to make the game interesting. But if you don't like the story / the narrative (which seems is all about chasing some young lady who ran away for 50+ hours; the only quest I enjoyed was the one about Baron's family) and having endless conversations, the rest just feels utterly boring for some reason I find hard to explain. 6.5/10, cannot recommend for folks like me who are starving for action rather than the narrative.",

        "review": "Personal words about the game: When The Witcher 3 first came out, it was getting a lot of praise for being a new and popular game. So I decided to keep my distance for a while. Later, when I saw an offer that included all three games in the series, I bought it.\n\nThere is something to tell about the story: I would love to say that the story picks up exactly where the last game left off, but there is a bit of a time jump. In this fantastical and twisted world, Geralt is on a quest to find his daughter, Ciri, and along the way, he faces a variety of events. These include playing Gwent, becoming a master fighter, hunting monsters, dealing with people, and yes, having romantic encounters with sorceresses. That being said, the fact that the main character and parts of the story are predefined limits how much we can respond to situations the way we would want to. You mostly get to choose between being angry, calm, or neutral.\n\nRetinal Pleasure or Art: When it was first released, the visual quality of The Witcher 3 was pretty solid. It was not groundbreaking, but it was good. After the Witcher TV show came out, the game got a next-gen upgrade, which made the visuals even better. Moving on to other aspects, the armor designs are intricate, similar to the previous games, and the weapons feel familiar and satisfying. The monster designs vary—some are disgusting, some are terrifying, and others are really impressive. Also, I absolutely loved the gothic and twisted design. One standout example for me was the eerie theme of the \"Ladies of the Wood.\"\n\nMechanics: This one is a bit tricky. Yes, the combat is really good. You have got two dodging mechanics, a variety of bombs, potions, oils, and the addition of magic, which all make the combat feel rich and diverse. Even today, it holds up well. But on the downside, it can get repetitive. There is no stealth or parkour, and the signs are a bit limited, so most of the time, you are just swinging your sword with a little bit of magic thrown in.\n\nNomismata: The game has a few small, minor DLCs, but let’s talk about the two big ones. First up, Hearts of Stone. This one does not really feel like a typical expansion, more like a collection of several large quests. That is not a bad thing, though—it adds a great story and various upgrades to the game. Now for the real deal, Blood and Wine. This DLC is amazing. It comes with a new map, tons of unique and special quests, new abilities, weapons, and most importantly, vampires.\n\nAtto Finale: At the end, The Witcher 3 totally deserves all the awards and praise it’s received. It gives you way more than your money’s worth, so if you have not played it yet, definitely pick it up. The only downside, in my opinion, is that it is not as deep of an RPG as it was marketed to be. No matter what you do, Geralt just swings his sword a bit differently or changes his attitude slightly in dialogue. Beyond that, there is not much variation. \n",

I was completely engrossed by the world and the main story (as well as the DLC stories) felt like a TV show as I immediately wanted to start the next quest like I would want to start a new episode. I recommend everyone who plays this game to do it on the hardest difficulty. Playing on the lower difficulties means you can skip a lot of mechanics and makes the combat stale after a while but on death march you have to use potions, oils and bombs which makes it way more engaging and fun.",

        "review": "The good points of the game are probably highlighted in a much better way in gazillion other reviews. Here are a few different points I feel I can write on.\n\nWorks smoothly on the Steam Deck. I recall using the default graphic settings it auto-detected for my console.\n\nIf you're a veteran RPG player and tend to go for higher difficulties:\n[list]\n    [*]Use the option \"enemy upscale\". It keeps the combat challenging throughout and consistent. No more silly one-shoting or overkilling (see what I did there) under-levelled enemies which makes combat and some quests too trivial to complete. More RPGs should have this option imo.\n    [*]You won't get the extra \"passed the main storyline\" achievement for that difficulty if you change it during your playthrough. I know that's obvious but this is even if you did it barely a few minutes into your playthrough. You'll then realise only when it's too late i.e. 60+ hours into the game on the final quest. Restart the storyline early on if you really want that achievement. \n[/list]",

        "review": "[code][i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by CD Projekt..[/i][/code]\n\n[h1]👋 First impression[/h1]\n\nThis is the first game of this kind that I've played and it was quite strange and confusing for me at first. Since I started the game quite a bit later than other people, I had quite high expectations for the game because I had already heard other players' opinions, watched videos and such. My first entry into this new world and this new story lived up to the expectations I had built up from outside informants. I can't compare to the old games as I haven't played them, but definitely my first impression of this game was pretty positive\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th]✔️Pros[/th]\n    [th]❌Cons[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]• Amazing and dynamic world\n\n         • Exquisite attention to detail, with gorgeous graphics\n         • So many missions and side quests [/td]\n    [td]• a few crashes here and there [/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]🎮 Gameplay[/h1]\n\n[b]•Exploring:[/b]\nExploring this big world can really be a lot of fun. There's something special about riding a horse knowing you're going to kill monsters. I've never had a problem with having to reach a further point on the map as there is something to do everywhere. Whether you are attacked by monsters in the forest, along the river, find a bandits camp, enter a cave or simply collect herbs... It is never boring\n\n[b]•Combat:[/b]\nThe combat is one of the places where this game really shines. You have two swords, one of which is silver and the other is steel. The game is designed in such a way that it really matters which sword you use against different opponents. You use the silver sword against monsters, as most of them have a weakness for silver and would easily handle a steel sword. Meanwhile the steel sword is much stronger against human opponents who use various shields and armors\n\n[b]•Crafting:[/b]\nI think the crafting is done pretty well. There are a bunch of different things you can craft for yourself. From different types of bombs, to swords and armors, to oils that are placed on your sword to further prepare for different beasts and let's not forget about the different potions. \n\n[h1]📖 Story[/h1]\n\nI think this is one of the best written stories in the world of video games. Every dialogue, every scene, every decision... All this always keeps you interested. The decisions you make in different scenes affect the world around you and you always understand when you didn't make the right decision.\n\n[h1]💻 Graphics / Art-style[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are great even at the lowest settings. Whenever you set out to complete a mission there is a sight that will make you stop for a moment and look at the sight before you and your horse. I personally loved riding Roach slowly through or around the various towns and just admiring the sights. It's quite soothing. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963806645\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961512976\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961880975\n\n[h1]📊 Performance[/h1]\n\nI had no problems at all.\n\nGame tested on:\n[table]\n [tr]\n    [th]CPU[/th]\n    [th]GPU[/th]\n    [th]RAM[/th]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n    [td]i7-9700K-BOX 3.6GHz[/td]\n    [td]Asus Rog Strix RTX 2080 Ti[/td]\n    [td]2x8GB[/td]\n [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]📋 Conclusion[/h1]\n\nMy conclusion is that the game is really worth every minute of play you give it. Although I recommend picking up the game when it's discounted, as it's already quite a few years old and has been discounted almost every time there's an occasion, I can guarantee it's worth it even at full price.",

        "review": "This game really took a huge leap forward in graphics from the previous games. Mindblowing beautiful scenes aswell as well made costumes of both the npcs and Geralts different armors. The story is so in depth from the simplest witcher contract to the main story questline. You feel deeply immersed in the world because of it. The only thing I felt was missing in this game was the amounts of times I burst out laughing. I found myself LMAO during my playthrough of witcher 1 and 2 simply because the dialogue was way less censored and used much more vulgar language. Maybe its just me, but the older games were much more fun because they didnt have to censor themselves like they have to today. Despite that I would say Witcher 3 is definitly the best game of the series so far. The main story is well written and the ending was an emotional rollercoaster that ended with a soft smile. But oh wasent i done there.... the DLC for this game was nothing short of amazing! I have never experienced a dlc so well built with a whole new contintent, armor, side quests, \"main story quest\" and so much more. The characthers and the quests were very fun to experience since it felt like they had more time to do it and hence give the feeling of it to be better written. The main quest in the dlc was way more satisfying to finish than the normal main quest. If you are thinking of buying this game, add the DLC to the shopping cart, you will not regret it!",

        "review": "Great game, fighting is incredibly fun, especially when you start cranking up the difficulty! Story is also engaging, although you do feel like you missed quite a couple of things if you haven't played the first and second games, but the story is still very enjoyable, with or without playing the first 2 games\r\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this game to pretty much everyone, if you don't like fighting, there's a great story, if love fighting, there are fun difficulty levels, with less \"hit it till it goes down\" and more strategy and prep to ensure you can take out a boss before you get absolutely rekt",

        "review": "Alright. Right off the bat I want to mention that, even though I gave this game a negative review, I still recommend it. I decided on giving it a negative review for several reasons:\n1- Most of this review is going to be spent bashing at this game for different, valid reasons even if it earns a positive score by the end\n2- My review would get lost in the sea of positive reviews praising this game to death and back\n3- Steam, please add a built-in way to rate games on a 1-10 scale (or at least a star based ranking) so that this isn’t necessary\n4- Also, I was unable to write the entire thing in the review itself, and had to put an external link because of Steam’s absurdly low word limit. Like for real, this entire thing might be an over 6k word analysis on The Witcher 3, so if you are only looking for a quick review, feel free to drop off when you get to the link\n\nWith all of that said, before starting off I must say that yes, you will probably love this game. So take it for granted that, unless you so happen to have similar likes to me in gaming, this will probably be one of your all-time favorites. So, go ahead, get it, you probably won’t regret it. \nIf you are interested, the things I value the most in games are good gameplay, good combat, enemy variety and boss battles. I can also enjoy a good story, but gameplay is usually king for me, and besides, this game’s story is incredibly flawed so that’s no excuse here\n\nAnd, let me tell you that, even if you have similar likes to me, this review will probably not be very useful because it is filled to the brim with spoilers. All I can say without spoiling much is that the gameplay in The Witcher 3 is average, boss battles are the bare minimum, side quests are overrated and the main story has some very noticeable flaws to it. Hearts of Stone improves on almost everything, while still having some issues, they are a bit more passable, though Blood and Wine has just as many issues as the main storyline. To be completely honest right here right now, I regret having purchased this game. If I had the opportunity to travel back in time and stop myself from buying this, and rather playing something else, I definitely would, even though I wouldn’t necessarily call The Witcher 3 a bad game and I enjoyed Hearts of Stone. I’d likely leave this game for later, when I’m older and can’t find anything better to play\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the analysis is too big and doesn’t fit within Steam’s word limit for reviews. Henceforth I had to turn it into a pastebin and link it here. I can understand that a lot of people won’t have time to read it, won’t want to read it or will be suspicious of the link even though it is 100% safe. For that reason, I decided to include a quick rundown version of what is in the pastebin below the link. Keep in mind that from here on out you are in Spoiler territory for the game\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/6DfSAnnS \n\n[b]Summary of the Pastebin:[/b]\nMain story is weak, with a decent start and first act (The Bloody Baron), but Novigrad and Skellige are a huge downgrade and feel like side content, and there’s a lot of missed potential in here, especially with Radovid as a potential antagonist. The Battle of Kaer Morhen and Bald Mountain are awesome high-points, but Final Preparations and Battle Preparations are rushed and kill the momentum of the game. On Thin Ice is very good though. The main story also moves very slowly as for a long time you’re on an endless quest of searching for Ciri\n\nGameplay is repetitive, Combat is okay, Side Quests are also too repetitive and boring, and Contracts are poorly designed with little time put into making each Contract monster stand out as unique and fun to fight. Oils, Potions, Bombs, Crafting, etc are a hindrance and are not fun to do. Enemy Variety is overall pretty low as you’ll often find yourself fighting repetitive, perhaps reskinned monsters that are the same as monsters you’ve fought earlier, and most Bosses are below average in quality, with a few “standouts” that are mostly still barely above average-decently good. Gwent is pretty well done, fortunately\n\nHearts of Stone is a huge improvement over the main story, but it’s still not amazing or anything. It has some flaws still, but a lot of them are more forgivable than the main story’s flaws. Good antagonist in Gaunter O’Dimm. \n\nBlood and Wine however, goes back to the main story’s ways, with a lot of missed potential for something incredible. The world of Toussaint is cool, but that’s not enough to call this DLC the gold standard and an absolute masterpiece. Dettlaff boss is probably the best one in the game though\n\nOverall, those are most if not all my main major thoughts on The Witcher 3’s main story and content. It isn’t the worst game I have ever played, and I wouldn’t really call TW3 a bad game either, but I sure as hell wouldn’t call it a masterpiece\n\n[h1]Base Game Score: 7/10 Good (Try it?)[/h1]\n\n[h1]Hearts of Stone DLC Score: 8/10 Great[/h1]\n\n[h1]Blood and Wine DLC Score: 7/10 Good (Hard carried by Dettlaff fight)[/h1]\n\nWell, I think that’s about it. This was probably the longest review I’ve ever written(counting the Pastebin) and will (hopefully) ever write, especially in such a negative tone. Sometimes, I myself can't believe that I actually put over 160 hours into this game, completed 2 full playthroughs of the main story (one of them in Death March), completed every Witcher Contract in the game and even got every single Gwent card. I guess I really had nothing better to play back then. As evidenced by this review however, I don't think I have what it takes to proceed with the rest of the 100% Completion process, so I'll leave it here, at least for now.\nI don’t have much more to say here, so I’ll leave you with the final score\n\n[h1]Final Grand Total Score: 7.5/10 Good (Try it?)[/h1]",

Breathless, exciting, immersive, immense in its ambitions and the size of its environments, the game is a success in all aspects. We could have feared a half-hearted transposition for the arrival of the witcher in an open world, but it is clear that CD Projekt has signed here a memorable work that will echo for a long time in the universe of Western RPGs. The power of the scenario, the quality of the graphics and the optimization on PC, all accompanied by a delectable gameplay contribute to immersing us in an epic and mature adventure that is very difficult to put down. A work that every role-playing game fan should try!\r\n\r\n19/20",

DLC's are also just like a part of game, if you buy them — you buy just like a witcher 3.5; However a lot of people say that it's mid written, too stretched and can't hold emotional tension well. Visual part of this game is very, very, very \"individual\". As for me: i hate the way it looks, the way it plays. I'd chose to read a book, than playing in it. P.S.: Played 74 minutes only on PC, played a lot more on PlayStation, yet don't like it anyways.\n\n6.5/10",

Hasn't been equaled in 9 years, if you're thinking you just might like it then definifely get it.\n\n  I personally recommend playing on Death March as you otherwise have no reason to use the wonderful alchemy system. Potions are expensive to make the first time around, but all, i repeat all your potions and bombs replenish for the cost of just one bottle of a strong alcohol when you meditate, meaning they're basically free as you both run into alcohest all the time and can buy it nearly everywhere. I've been popping potions like a druggie and i've never needed to buy alcohest.",

        "review": "The Witcher 3, it's my first game in the Witcher franchise and I enjoyed this game wonderfully. It has a very rich and in-depth story where you can forge your own path and select your own outcomes. I owned this game for a long time and just never gotten to the point of finishing it until this year. It's an amazing game although not perfect it's damn near close enough.  \r\n\r\npros: It has rich story where your decision impacts the story-line and your surroundings. The graphics at the time of writing this has aged well and the game still looks great (including the next-gen update). Some of the scenery is absolutely breathtaking and the cut scenes is nice. The voice acting is great and each character has their own personality. A great selection of swords, armor and even crafting grand-master gear is worth while. This is also one of the few games where the dlcs are an absolute must complete and gets better. Blood and Wine is one of the best looking and best story-lines dlcs I have played in fanatasy games in the wild, and it's location is near the size of the main area in the base game. The side quest in this game are a gem, I must admit even on equal to the main story.\r\n\r\nCons: While playing this game I encountered a-lot of bugs that didn't age well. The combat although it was cool dismembering npcs was very clunky and somewhat outdated. Combat wasn't difficulty but sometimes you would miss based on weird camera angles. Boss enemies could not be locked on if I remember making the combat feel more clunky. Some bugs would straight up crash the game forcing me to restart areas multiple times. When dismembering npcs they would have generic models for the heads and sometimes bodies, for example if you dismembered a bandit wearing a hood or rogue knight wearing a helmet, those items would disappear showing the same base npc heads. Where bugs like npc clipping and floaty items could really take you out of the immersion sometimes. \r\n\r\nConclusion: Regardless of the cons, many of the pros out weigh the cons. The story was deep and rich and the moral decision of choices made the game feel more than just selection chat bar. Overall I would give this game a 8/10 it would have 1 more point if mainly the constant bugs and crashes did not exist.",

Once I got to Novigrad, then the game really started to pick up steam for me. By the time I had finished the main story I had decided that this was one of the greatest games I had ever played. On top of that, the DLCs are beyond amazing, \"Blood and Wine\" is the greatest DLC ever made, no contest. If you love a great story, great game play, awesome exploration, gripping side quests, or hell even a good card game, you will absolutely love this game. I cannot recommend this game enough.",

The game holds well as time goes by and I'm constantly discovering so many things I've never seen before so many years after it came out. The rich story and open ended nature of the game lends well to its replayability. The DLCs are more of the same. Well developed game in an incredibly complex world. It's not a perfect adaptation of the books, but it is done in such good taste that it doesn't matter.",

Haven't ever played a Triple A game that genuinely put so much care into not only the main story but every random interaction possible. As if the gameplay was not good enough, they decided to add an entire new card game called Gwent that has its own strategies and mechanics. Also, The DLC is like a whole new game as well with a whole new zone to explore with EVEN MORE care put into how you interact with it. Don't listen to me just buy it already!\r\n\r\nThe only reason this game is not a perfect 10 is because of a few minor annoyances like horse riding could be finnicky at times as well as crashing a few times making me redo certain objectives again.\r\n\r\n9.5/10",

Cyberpunk crashed 2 or 3 times over the course of almost 200 hours. This crashes 2 or 3 times every hour. Two - combat. This is clearly a skill issue, V could handle Adam Smasher at the highest difficulty with Johnny's handgun. Geralt has died so many times to wild dogs it's as if I'm speed running the most pathetic achievement ever.",

The graphics, the gameplay, the storyline—it all exceeded my expectations. Every level felt like a new adventure, filled with surprises and challenges that kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters were so well-developed that I found myself genuinely caring about their fates, and the world-building was nothing short of immersive.\n\nAs I progressed, it became more than just a game; it was an experience, a journey I didn’t want to end. Each moment spent in this virtual universe felt like a perfect escape from reality. The developers truly poured their heart and soul into every detail, and it shows.\n\nTHIS GAME IS LIKE COCANINE",

        "review": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterpiece in the realm of open-world RPGs, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep, engaging experience. Here's why:\n\nPros:\nVariety and Freedom: One of the standout features is the incredible variety in how you approach quests and combat. Whether you're crafting, fighting, or using signs, there's a build for every playstyle. This flexibility keeps the game fresh and allows for multiple playthroughs with different strategies.\nOpen World Exploration: The game's world is vast, beautifully crafted, and filled with lore. Fast travel points are abundant, making navigation convenient without sacrificing the sense of exploration.\nEnemy Diversity: The range of foes you encounter is impressive, from mundane beasts to mythical creatures, each requiring different tactics to defeat.\nStory and Voice Acting: The narrative is compelling, with twists and turns that keep you invested. The voice acting is great, bringing most characters to life with emotional depth and authenticity.\n\nCould be better:\nNPC Variety: While the world is expansive, the NPCs can feel repetitive. More unique characters or dynamic interactions could enhance immersion.\nPotions Overload: The alchemy system, while detailed, can be overwhelming. Simplifying it might make it more accessible.\nNPC Interaction: It would be nice if Geralt could have more direct impact or dialogue options with NPCs to address \"grievances\" (wink-wink).\nGraphics: While still visually appealing, the graphics don't quite match up to the latest standards, of course. However, the art direction and atmosphere more than compensate for this.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Witcher 3 remains a benchmark for what RPGs can achieve. Its rich world, engaging gameplay, and memorable story make it a must-play. If you're willing to overlook some dated graphics and dive into a complex but rewarding system, you'll find a game that offers hundreds of hours of fun content with genuine emotional depth. Highly recommended for both newcomers and veterans of the RPG genre.",

I thoroughly enjoyed The Witcher 3 even by modern gaming standards.\n\nDownsides are the game is still very buggy. Unfortunately a lot of the bugs aren't the haha funny kind. They lean towards more game breaking and require a restart a lot of the times. It still gets a pass IMO because of the sheer size and content contained within The Witcher 3. Even by modern gaming standards it would be considered a highly ambitious game. To think it came out in 2015 despite many updates I'm simply awestruck by how ahead of it's time The Witcher 3 was.",

I played on the console in the first one, and I must say the true experience comes with playing with an Xbox controller. Anyways the game is fabulous: The lore, gameplay, characters, soundtracks... I'm not even mentioning the quality of DLC's. If you still haven't played this game, you must before Witcher 4. I sure hope that it will live up to our expectations and won't be a failure like Cyberpunk 2077.",

I have read all the books and even like this game better than them.\r\n\r\nSide quests feel like main quests in other games, conversation choices have consequences, combat is competent enough and responsive compared to turn based shit, water works well, animations have no right being this good in a game that seems to get everything else right and the content is so plentiful. \r\n\r\nCan I also just take a second to commend this game's internal logic when it comes to item/quest order dependant dialogue. Other devs would just lock every part of a quest out so they could have it follow one chain. This game manages to account for so many different things when playing. I love it.\r\n\r\nThe kind of veteran talent that made this game after years of learning the craft have been replaced with green ass kids and activists writers who are some of the most boring human beings on earth with no appreciation for sophisticated literature. They can't write complicated characters and they don't have an ounce of humour in them.\r\n\r\nA game like this and many others of the past dance circles around them.",

        "review": "I bought The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt eight years ago, but only recently started playing it. Despite the passage of time, this game remains a true masterpiece. Even after eight years, it stands out as one of the best AAA games out there. The graphics are stunning, and the story is top-notch.\r\n\r\nThe game’s open-world environment is incredibly immersive, with lush, detailed landscapes and a dynamic weather system that adds to the authenticity1. The narrative is deeply engaging, following Geralt of Rivia on his quest to find his long-lost lover, Yennefer, and his surrogate daughter, Ciri2. The story is filled with rich lore, emotional depth, and complex characters, making every quest feel meaningful and rewarding2.\r\n\r\nThe combat system is another highlight, offering a blend of swordplay, magic, and alchemy that keeps battles exciting and strategic2. The game’s world is vast and filled with content, ensuring that there’s always something new to discover or a monster to hunt2.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Witcher 3 is a game that has aged like fine wine. Its graphics, story, and gameplay mechanics are still among the best in the industry, making it a must-play for any RPG fan.",

There is no way for me to complete this game because of the crashing issues. I have tried playing on dx11 and dx12, both crash endlessly. It feels like they are trying to destroy these great games in order to force people into playing the garbage games they are releasing now.\n\nI now have this game sitting in my library that I can't play. Please fix the crashing issues!!! As of now, I do not recommend this gamer and, in fact, would like my money back given that the new gen update is what has made this game unplayable. I will update this review if the game gets fixed. As a side note, before the crashing issues, this game is far and above one of my favorite games I play of the few games I actually invest my time into.",

        "review": "The game mechanics are decent in general (some notes below), the world is expansive and incredibly detailed with loads of variety, and the overall narrative arc is absolutely masterful. I was actually moved to emotion in a few places.\r\n\r\nThings I liked:\r\n\r\n* Combat mechanics are just sophisticated enough to make battles interesting, without over-complicating controls. \r\n* Fast-travel at key key locations makes moving from objective to objective much easier than having to gallop for 15 minutes (as in Red Dead Redemption). \r\n* visual cues make searching and moving through objectives on a mission relatively easy. \r\n\r\nThings I didn't like: \r\n* Swimming underwater, especially in the dark, is next to impossible. There are some missions I simply cannot complete, because the swimming is just too difficult.\r\n* Camera views can get bolloxed up at times, especially in close quarters. Sometimes, this will get Geralt stuck under roof eaves, or in rock crevices, or cause you to plummet off cliffs. \r\n* In 115 hours of play time, there were 3 hard crashes. Nothing about the circumstances in-game seemed to relate the crashes to each other in any way.  \r\n* The Skellige storyline is too \"ladies can DO STUFF now!\" for my taste. Your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nOverall:\r\nFun game, very engaging story. This game is definitely NOT for anyone under 16.",

Fun random conversations at points.\n\nGameplay: 6/10 At some point is feels like every quest is the same, until the end game story post defending kaer morhen. Mount, ladder, swimming, examine animations becomes annoying. When it comes to combat later in the game, it's just like Skyrim, spamming attacks because you are overpowered.

Many characters are given chances to be well fleshed-out and you get a chance to explore Geralt's many past relationships.\r\n\r\nOf all the games I've played, this is the one that takes the \"your decisions change the outcome\" and handles it the best. Even in side quests your choices matter and you can really feel the impact of your options. At times, it feels like there's no right or wrong answer and you have to carry the weight of the inevitable consequences of the decision put forth to you.\r\n\r\nI played on the highest difficulty for achievement sake, so I did find the combat enjoyable enough without breezing through. Optimising your loadout/potion usage for your specific opponent(s) is enjoyable, as is creating different builds through armour sets and mutations. I suspect it'd be much simpler on lower difficulties, though still enjoyable.",

        "review": "IT IS A GREAT GAME, GO PLAY IT!\n\n\nYet...\nAfter the 1st playthrough, \nMy love towards this game diminished significantly. The jank grew from minor annoyance into a big one. (Like the somewhat unresponsive Gerald controll.)\nI love the combat, it is a shame that the closest I know is of the Souls-esque, that I dislike. The story and characters are great, but the quests are mostly on the quantity side. For every \"Baron\" you have 10+ monster/treasure hunt, don't get me wrong hunting monsters is THE WITCHER thing to do but after the 5th hunt, you have seen what the game has to offer.\n\nAnd just to add oil to the clown award or dislike I may get. This is a AA game masquerading as AAA. When those two things were ment something. This \"falsehood\" set up the inevitable Cyberpunk disaster... What a great game can cause, and how will it not matter as time progresses...",

Not only did the game age incredibly well, the DLCs which I never played back then, are amazing on top of all the other changes that they made including the next-gen upgrade.\r\n\r\nI extremely recommend this game to anyone, even the ones who never played the first 2 games. You should enjoy this game while you can. It's truly a once in a lifetime experience.",

The Witcher 3 is, in my opinion, the GREATEST RPG ever created. It has also been my personal favorite game of ALL time since 2015, surpassing bloodborne. Everything about the game is pretty much perfect in every way and I find myself constantly going back to it at least once a year. I got it on pc a while ago but my old machine was too crappy to run it. Now since I have a new, much more powerful machine, I will most likely sink another 2-300 hours into this account. I would buy this game today if it was $70 and I'd pay an extra $40 for DLC. Now the game is like $10-20 with $10 DLC. Which mind you is probably one of the greatest DLCs ever created. Absolute masterclass in gaming and just entertainment as a whole. 10/10.",

I loved White Orchard, kinda enjoyed Velen, was amazed by Novigrad then burnt out during Skellige, so I finished the main questline while I was wishing Ciri's death after spending dozens of hour killing countinously respawning armies of drowners, wild dogs, wolves, bandits, sometimes spiced up with some worthy opponents.  The thing is I still think I was right in that aspect, the base game is just simply bad, even the quests are just \"hold the right button, follow the red marks\". I could wrote essays about how the worldmap is too big for its own good, and the fast travel system actually shrinking it for less than the first two episodes. \nBut the second time I've actually managed to start the DLCs, and oh boy, they were pure gold, washing away all the sins of the base game. We finally got great stories, great characters, meaningful level progression. Olgierd and Regis will be always remembered. I can finally recommend the game after so many patches and these new content.",

Whether it's exploring the vast landscapes, engaging in intense battles, or making decisions that shape the narrative, I find myself completely absorbed in the game. The lore, the detailed quests, and the chance to embody Geralt of Rivia make it an experience that I come back to time and time again. It’s more than just a game to me—it’s an adventure I’m always eager to dive into.",

Dark, moody, and sarcastic protagonist with so many interesting characters along the way.. you can really get lost in its creator's imagination.  Andrzej Sapkowski created a very unique world with plenty of polish folklore charm and this game brings it to life. \r\n\r\nThe latest update to this game puts it far ahead in graphic quality to many games out even this year. With over 150 hours of content from the main game and its two stellar DLCs, you can replay the game a month after finishing and it still feels fresh. The DLCs also allow you to approach both new stories separate from the main game, which really underlines how the complete game is truly three in one. Each of the DLCs are better than many full offerings from other studios in both content and quality.\r\n\r\nA huge community of modders (and the recent release of the devkit) makes for even more replay value. ~7.000 mods on nexus at this point, with more every week. And, if you have VR, check out vorpX for a whole new way to experience the game in 3D!\r\n\r\nGame of the year for a reason. I own this game on GOG, Steam, PS5, Xbox, and Switch. I have bought copies for too many friends. Etsy has supplied my mancave with a Witcher theme. I LOVE THIS GAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

        "review": "I like the feeling of exploring a somewhat alive medieval fantasy world, but the core gameplay loop is pretty repetitive. Ride around on your horse, take on a quest or contract, then fulfill usually simple tasks like killing bandits, tracking down and hunting monsters, solving problems through basic dialogue, and occasionally being used as a messenger. It's pretty fun however and can be really addictive, but I found that Geralt wasn't really that interesting and the story was underwhelming, probably because I'm missing a lot of context from the books and other games. Overall I recommend if you're not expecting a game with the depth of like RDR2 and enjoy the setting.",

For context Gwent is a side activity which is optional inside the game and can be played across the world. Gwent alone has enough fun and strategy in it to be worth 40 plus hours. The optional card game to play in taverns. I am 44 hours in. I have made it to less then a 3rd of the map. I have done less then 20 percent of the main quest. Yet I have never been bored, never been angered, never had a moment where I wasn't fully enraptured by the story. This game is simply sublime. From the main story to sidequests. Every inch of this game is master crafted and it shows. This game is 10 years old and it still holds up to this day as one of the very greatest RPGs ever made. It's worth it at any price you can get it.",

The open-world is mesmerizing, filled to the brim with life, human or wild, side-quests that range from the funniest I've seen in an RPG to the darkest. OST is a masterpiece. Gameplay is good action-RPG mechanics, nothing too hard, but this fits a rather story-oriented game (as opposed to more \"quiet\" and gameplay-focused FromSoft titles for instance).\n\nDeserved its GOTY in 2015, deserves its legendary status ten years later. Go play it!\n",

The story is rich and captivating, pulling you into Geralt’s world with engaging characters and plots. The narrative is full of memorable moments that keep you invested throughout.\n\nThe combat remains fantastic and satisfying. It’s a blend of action and strategy that has aged remarkably well, making every fight feel intense and rewarding. Whether you’re battling a fearsome monster or outnumbered in a tough fight, the gameplay still holds up.\n\nThe landscapes in The Witcher 3 are absolutely stunning. The attention to detail in the environments creates a beautiful and immersive world that you’ll love exploring. The variety of monsters you encounter adds to the thrill, each one bringing its own unique challenge.\n\nAnd don’t overlook Gwent—it’s seriously addictive and adds a lot of fun to the game. Whether you’re taking a breather from the main quests or just up for a bit of a challenge, Gwent’s a great way to keep things interesting. Overall, The Witcher 3 is an epic adventure that still stands out and is totally worth playing, even years after its release.",

        "review": "If you're a fan of story focused adventure then this is about the best there is. The world building, characters, and dialogue are top notch. Mechanically speaking it's relatively basic, but it's not a problem given that the story is what drives you forward. There were two decent issues however, the first being a slow start. The initial setting (white orchard / Velen) plays somewhat slow and it took me multiple revisits of this game before I could cross that threshold. The second issue is that it's very easy to get endings you don't want. To avoid this you would have to research nearly every decision just on the off chance that it changes how the story progresses. Even side quests will effect the fates of certain characters. It's almost as if the game is constructed specifically to give you unintended outcomes, so that you would replay it again. Normally I would have no problem with this, but the game is massive and long winded. I'm sure there are many people that wouldn't be fazed by this design however. \r\n\r\n9.3 / 10  A must play for story enthusiasts and a great template for what open world games should be.",

The soundtrack is fantastic—immersive and memorable enough that I could imagine listening to it while working on other tasks.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning, though at times, there’s a bit too much visual noise, making it hard to see certain things clearly. However, wandering through the varied terrains remains a great experience.\n\nOverall, 10/10—well deserved GOTY!",

Massive open-world, plotlines that weave in and out of each other, great voice-acting, consequential actions, a huge variety of gear, visceral and sometimes challenging combat, and well-crafted characters all come together to form an experience that feels alive and real. The graphics are plain beautiful, and the diversity of monsters is great; I'm often fascinated by them, and each Witcher contract feels interesting because of that. I initially intended to play the three Witcher games through in narrative order, but didn't end up doing that. As a result, whilst the game is perfectly accessible, I do find myself missing some context for certain events, lore or relationships (Yennefer and Triss being prime, spoiler-free  examples.)\r\n\r\nI find combat between Geralt and other humanoids rather bland. In single combat, you just carve through anyone with ease and the same combination of moves; group combat is rendered challenging only due to the risk of mistiming an attack and getting struck by another enemy. The bosses are only a real struggle on Death March, such that the smallest mistake is really a death sentence, but going down to the next difficulty level is underwhelming. Often I only lose fights due to a misread or too much ambition, rather than genuinely being challenged. I must say that constantly doing tiny little tasks to get information or help is a little tedious; there's rarely a straight-forward quest, but when done well, it is immersive.",

        "review": "I was very new to gaming when this game was introduced to me, so the first thing that immediately made me like it, was the difficulty options you can choose from. It made it very clear that even without much experience this game could be for you.\nAfter many many hours of playing I now decided to write a review to convince more people to play this game. \n\nStory:\nThe storytelling is amazing. You have a main quest/story line that branches off into many side quests/story lines and you find out a lot of things about Geralt of Rivia, his friends, his relationships and his enemy's. What I liked most is the different dialogue options and outcome options. Some outcomes you choose even influence future story lines and are incorporated, so you could play it more than once choosing different outcomes, difficulties and relationships. \n\nGraphics/World Exploring: \nThe graphics of the game are just amazing. It feels like a realistic new world that you are captured into. Since the graphics are very nice it also makes a lot of fun to just run around the world to explore it. Loot houses, find hidden treasures, explore realistic looking caves and help people in need. Also it was a huge bonus to have a nice soundtrack playing in the background. The music changed for combat scenes, exploring and quests. It generally changed for most locations. \n\nCombat: \nAs a beginner it was actually pretty easy to get into the fighting style used in this game. You have a short introduction into it, which honestly was enough to understand the basic fighting techniques. When you go on playing it gets easier due to oils, potions and more understanding of the monsters and their weaknesses. \n\nGWENT:\nGwent is the card game inside the game and I absolutely LOVED it. After fighting, the highlight was to find a Merchant or INN-keep and just ask them for a round of gwent. I need this game in real-life. \n\nI bought this game when it was on sale for a very small price, but it is definitely worth the full price. Not long after I started playing I bought both DLCs for full price, so I think that says a lot (I have not started playing them yet, but have only heard good things). \n\nAll in all, I would totally recommend this game to beginners, amateurs and heavy gamers. Be aware that it does include blood, combat, nudity, foul language and sex - which I don't mind and it adds a lot to the game.",

        "review": "What stands out most is the storytelling. Whether it’s the main quest—Geralt’s journey to find Ciri or side quests, everything feels deeply personal. These aren’t your standard RPG fetch quests; they’re stories with emotional weight, often challenging your morals or surprising you with unexpected outcomes. It’s rare for a game to make you care so much about its world and characters, but The Witcher 3 pulls it off effortlessly.\r\n\r\nWhat keeps you coming back is the world itself—sprawling, wild, and full of mystery. From the eerie, fog-covered swamps of Velen to the windswept islands of Skellige, every location is alive with history and atmosphere. The attention to detail is staggering, with every corner of the map feeling like it has a story to tell.\r\n\r\nAnd at the heart of it all is Geralt—cynical yet compassionate, tired but unbreakable. His relationships, particularly with Ciri and Yennefer, ground the narrative in something deeply human, making the stakes feel real in a way that few games manage to capture. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  grabs hold of you and doesn’t let go. It’s an experience that stays with you.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Highly reccomended",

This is truly the perfect game, the story, characters, combat, and world are absolute perfection, the fact that past actions can have an effect later on is truly amazing, the different contracts and unique monster designs are so cool, the soundtrack is perfect and can make you feel so many things at once, the characters all have amazing writings and none of them ever feel bland, the open world is filled to the brim with content that actually means something and not stupid bullshit like Ubishit tends to do nowadays, it feels alive and you'll find yourself getting lost in it several times as you progress through the game, the story constantly has you invested and eager to see what happens next while never once leaving you bored or uninterested. The Witcher III is truly CD PROJECKT RED's magnum opus. This game came out in 2015 and holds up 9 years later. If you have not bought The Witcher III, I highly recommend you do so, you will end up having fun, I promise you.",

Makes you feel that power fantasy of being able to slice through enemies, but if you're not careful they can pose a major threat.",
