After slaying idols and achieving all there is to achieve, I stood atop a throne of relics, white through red, and I pondered the name of the game that I play. Risk Of Rain 2, why is it named this way? And then I looped yet again, tens of stages behind me, and I cut through the foes like a blade through butter. Everywhere I went, a flurry of destruction followed. Missiles, flames, electricity and knives poured down from the sky as if the gods were bleeding. Death was all that could be heard as the world came to a jeering halt. And there I stared at my frozen world, and from a distance I learned the reason for this game's name. Bullets, hellfire, the very cargo that I wield is the rain. The risk? That's me.\r\nAnd with the frozen scene I realize one other thing... I need a better PC.",

I loved this game but I can't bear to play it and find more unwelcome changes. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy the game in the state that it is I am happy for you. I can't find that for myself so I'm going to let this game rot in my library.\r\n\r\nPlay Risk of Rain 2. Maybe you'll enjoy it",

If you miss it, expect to waste more time running across the map again. \n-The game has a mechanic where it gets progressively more difficult as you play, so the large maps and platforming are there to waste your time so the game can get harder. \n\nI'd return it if I could.",

My concern is the sheer amount of bugs that were immediately prevalent that should have been caught with even the smallest amount of playtesting. I'm not sure the most recent DLC adds enough to warrant purchasing, but at minimum this game in vanilla remains phenomenal. The Void DLC is incredibly good and adds a lot of neat mechanics to ror2 (ignoring the new final boss). The Seekers DLC still needs work from Gearbox.",

I DEMAND AN APOLOGY FOR WASTING MY TIME AND I WANT MY FUCKING MONEY BACK! \n\nI guess I should actually review this, so here:\n\nThe whole point of this game is to build up a character making them more powerful by collecting items. I was having a TON of fun doing so. Personally, I hate using guides because that ruins all the fun of finding what works. I guess I should have read at least one about how much bullshit mithrix is. Anyways, today I had my best run ever. I was melting / exploding enemies 0.2 seconds after they spawned. Nothing stood a chance. Not even the first 3 phases of the final boss. It felt amazing finally having a run with a build that worked. But then, the 4th stage of the final boss TAKES ALL MY ITEMS AWAY AND IMMEDIATELY FUCKING ONE SHOTS ME, ENDING ALL THE FUCKING WORK I PUT IN COLLECTING ITEMS!!! What was the fucking point of it all? Why would I want to play again? Making a different build will make no difference in fighting mithrix. All those items mean nothing. The devs should just remove everything from the game and make a single stage where you fight the final boss with no items because that's the \"real\" point / challenge / purpose of this game anyways. Mithrix should have been a special stage or challenge boss. Making it the final boss of the main game is so counter intuitive to the entire game design of character building I actually can't believe anyone would think it's a good idea and I'm convinced they just wanted to piss people off. I mean, why would you ruin such a fun game by nulling the main hook of the gameplay?\n\nIn fact...\n\nThis shit pissed me off SO MUCH I literally wrote my FIRST review ever.\n\nDO NOT PLAY RoR2 UNLESS YOU ENJOY BEING PISSED OFF BY THE, ABSOLUTE, MOST UNFAIR BULLSHIT I'VE SEEN IN ANY GAME EVER!!!\n\nIf the devs would remove 4th phase mithrix from the main game and make it an optional extra fight then this game would go straight to recommened. \n\n(yes, I know, grammar, whatever)",

The base game has lots of content already. The first addon is fine, the void items are fun, the sniper is a cool character I like to play, but the game is also fine without it.",

        "review": "Is this a good game? Yeah. It is. The dedicated fans can tell you here or on YouTube. However, the rest of this is me expressing frustration as I uninstall the game a third time.\n\nThe apologists say, \"when you die it always feels like your fault.\" I've heard that a few times. It just isn't simply the case. On a fundamental level, it goes against the rogue-like credo to learn through dying. Things will blow you up, melt you, swarm you, or push you to oblivion. On good, hour-long runs. And you'll say, well damn.\n\nFurther, there are times where I don't know why I won. Or why I was allowed to win. I mean I can look at my build in hindsight and go, \"that's too powerful.\" The first time I beat the final boss, I just got watch from a distance while my build did the rest. Someone who has won a lot would probably say, \"oh, that's cool,\" but it felt cheap and artificial to me. And it made losing more skill-based runs feel worse.\n\nMore, the gameplay loop really is run around, mow down large hordes of the same enemies and grab items. Find an frustratingly obscure teleporter, and start over. I can hear people say that I don't understand the game, and yes I got to experience the hype moments, hype movement, and hype builds. But, if we are honest with ourselves, that really is the cycle.  That is the core of it. On particularly bad runs, I find myself saying, \"What am I doing with my life? What a waste of a day on repetitive bull-crap.\"\n\nProbably most importantly, the game is addicting, and not in a good way. When I catch myself saying \"this is the run\" for the third time that day with bloodshot eyes, I know I'm in the danger zone. Or, \"one more try,\" after playing for 4 hours. I've got a family. I can't be binge-playing games anymore. It's one of those rogue-likes that hits hard for gamblers. \n\nLastly, this game is buggy. \"Gearbox, am I right?\" Yes and no. I bought this game pre-Gearbox, and my first three playthrough were so comically buggy that I uninstalled the game afterwards, saying, \"I don't think this game is ready.\" Even now, the game will crash on good runs for no reason (especially Abyssal Depths for me, even when not a lot of creatures), and behave oddly on others.\n\nWith all that, it is a good game. It feels cool to discover. It has a good sense of mystery and exploration about it.",

Now that the new DLC is out there are 3 achievements that I can't get because I'm not paying just to get them and I know I won't ever use the expansion in my games.\n\nWhy is there a legendary related to getting gold? Even if a legendary didn't go with a build before at least it was still cool that your shots caused an explosion or an AoE sphere formed around you. Now if you're lucky enough to get a legendary there's a chance you'll get unlucky and get that War Bonds garbage.\n\nElites that are not fun/game breaking as well. Get this game if you're fine not having 100% of achievements. It's amazing before this Seekers of the Storm DLC.",

This is the reason why people like looping more than killing the final boss. Vanilla Mithrix kinda sucks especially in phase 4 if you suck. If you hate vanilla Mithrix, I recommend you get the umbral Mithrix mod. It is absolutely better and harder (in a good way) to beat than vanilla. There is also a practice mode for it if you want to practice.",

Unfortunately with the update that accompanied the Seekers of the Storm DLC Gearbox and CO have royally screwed this game. My friends and I can't even load into a lobby anymore, much less complete a run. Even playing solo doesn't prevent all the issues. Weird physics bugs still plague the single player.\nOverall this is an extremely fun game that was completely broken with the most recent update as of this review. Until Gearbox makes significant progress towards making the game stable again I cannot recommend this game.",

The early game pacing is too sluggish, and while I know the appeal is supposed to come from stacking items and scaling power, it just didn‚Äôt hook me.\n\nAs someone who enjoyed Returnal, Risk of Rain 2 felt like a watered-down version without the tight combat and cinematic polish. The randomness and chaos didn't make up for the lack of immediate engagement, and it left me wanting more substance.\n\nIf you enjoy slower, co-op roguelikes that focus on item synergy over time, this might be your thing. But for me, it just didn't live up to the excitement or challenge I was hoping for.",

Ramping up in difficulty throughout it's many unique and diverse stages, there is hardly a time when you're bored playing it, except, perhaps, unlocking some of the older abilities of the older cast of characters, who's unlock requirements are sometimes bloated compared to most of the newer survivors.",

        "review": "The game is still fucking broken Gearbox!!!! You still have a lot of work to do to fix this fucking shit heap of a game! A few bug fixes aren't going to cut it, the game is STILL fundamentally broken and completely unplayable. This game used to reward skillful play and adaptation however it is now COMPLETE gambling. This game doesn't give a shit how good you are at it. Gearbox doesn't care about how many hours you've sunk into this game to improve, this game is completely luck based now with no skill involved and HORRIBLE item balancing. Gearbox has ruined multiple survivors, the item pool, and the gameplay loop entirely. This game is complete and utter dogshit now. I absolutely hate the new elites. The new maps are ENORMOUS and yet guess what one fucking item they didn't add in this update, a movement item! So have fun searching a stage the size of a fucking football stadium just for worthless items that will NOT help you with the insane difficulty spike, all while you have no mobility to dodge the insane amount of enemies!\nThe balance is INSANE. This game did not used to play like this. On stage 5, no matter if your run is fast or slow, the director will completely fuck you over and just spawn like a billion guilded enemies EVERY FUCKING TIME!!!!!!!\nIT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU HAVE A GOD RUN, THERE IS NO WAY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE 50,000 FUCKING GUILDED ENEMIES CLUTTERING UP YOUR SCREEN THAT ALL TAKE ZERO DAMAGE AND STEAL ALL YOUR GOLD.\nGEARBOX IT IS THE FIRST FUCKING LOOP WHY IS LITERALLY EVERY OTHER ENEMY A GUILDED ELITE VARIANT??????? WHO THE FUCK BALANCED THIS???? WHO MADE THESE CHANGES????\nI would like to remind everyone that in the past, elite spawns rates were not this high and this frequent. Gearbox thought it would be a good idea to add TWO new elite types with the WORST gameplay mechanics and to INCREASE the amount of elite spawns.\nYeah, totally needed balance changes, thanks Gearbox!!\nThe new elites are completely retarded. I am convinced an AI came up with these elite types.\nYou're telling me Gearbox thinks it's a good idea to add an enemy that takes away your gold when you shoot it, give it the tankiest hp AND a shield on top of that, AND make LITERALLY EVERY OTHER ENEMY BE THIS ELITE TYPE???\nWOW THIS IS SUCH A FUN CHANGE!!! I LOVE HAVING NO MONEY!!!!! I LOVE DOING NO DAMAGE TO THE SQUISHIEST OF ENEMIES!!!!!!! I LOVE MY LOOPS TAKING EVEN FUCKING LONGER THAN THEY ALREADY WERE AND THEN GETTING PUNISHED FOR PLAYING THE FUCKING GAME AS INTENDED!!!!!! I LOVE HAVING NO DIRECT COUNTER TO THIS ENEMY AND FOR BEING ACTIVELY PUNISHED FOR BEING BETTER AT THE GAME!!!!! I LOVE ENEMIES WHERE THE ENTIRE MECHANIC IS TO NOT SHOOT THEM THAT'S SUCH A FUN AND WELL THOUGHT OUT GAME MECHANIC!!!!! LIKE YEAH GREAT MECHANIC UH HUH YOU KNOW WHY I PLAY VIDEO GAMES? OBVIOUSLY NOT TO FEEL POWERFUL OR HAVE FUN NO I LOOOOVE NOT SHOOTING THE ENEMIES!!!!! I HATE SHOOTING ENEMIES YEAH THAT'S A GREAT FUCKING GAME MECHANIC LET'S PUNISH THE PLAYER FOR SHOOTING THE FUCKING ENEMY. LET'S PUNISH THE PLAYER FOR PLAYING THE FUCKING VIDEO GAME AS INTENDED WHAT A SMART FUCKING IDEA. WOW. REALLY MIND BLOWING.\nFUCK YOU GEARBOX!!!!!!!! SUCK MY FUCKING DICK!!!!!!!!!! I FUCKING HATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!! YOU TOOK MY BABY AND FUCKING EXECUTED IT!!!!!!!! YOU BEHEADED IT!!!!!!!! YOU FUCKING MADE IT SO GOD DAMN AWFUL FUCK YOU!!!!!!! NEVER IN MY FUCKING LIFE HAVE I HAD TO DOWN PATCH A GAME JUST TO ENJOY IT UNTIL FUCKING NOW!!!!!!!!!! YOU DON'T DESERVE A CENT OF THE FUCKING PROFIT YOU GAINED THROUGH THE DLC IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TREAT THIS BELOVED FRANCHISE LIKE TRASH. GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU GREEDY BASTARDS!!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS  R U I N E D!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSHITTY SHIT SHIT FUCKING SHIT ASS FUCKER SHIT SHIT DICK FUCKING FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS MAD ABOUT A GAME!!!\nI PAID FOR MY GAME TO BE WORSE!\nI ACTUALLY PAID MONEY FOR MY GAME... TO BE WORSE...\nCOOL! :)\nFUN! :)\nAMAZING FUCKING CHANGES GEARBOX 10/10 WOULD NOT SHOOT ENEMIES AGAIN!! :))))",

This game is on my top 3 all time... until the update popped up and made the game objectively worse. 90+% of my time is spent in the hardest difficulty, just for some perspective. \n\nReal quick, a list of things that are GOOD about the DLC:\n-The soundtrack SLAPS. Top three all time soundtrack without a question, probably #1. The new map songs are just as good. \n-The new maps are a great addition to the game\n\nAnd that's it. I guaruntee this game wasn't play tested to any sort of degree. The best example of this is that the bosses laser and the mini boss lasers WERE SYNCED TO FPS. WHO DOES THIS?\n- 80+ percent of the new items are insta-scrap. The knockup item is garbage, the green thorn does nothing, the split damage is a negative in many cases, and that's just the start. On the subject of items, the sale star should be a red tier. It makes some runs absolutely non-fun when used properly and makes command artifact just dumb (with current scaling). \n- Chef is comically bad. He feels bad. His combos suck. His abilities hardly synergize. He's a 1 trick. I don't know how you have multiple good mods to look at and this is absolutely a worse version of any of them. \n- Speaking of which, scaling is hot garbage now. You'll get to stage four and die before you even spawn (because bad guys can spawn before you!?). They claimed to fix the issue where on stage one you'll be waiting around... I'm not sure I've noticed it being any better.\n- 'Gilded' is absolute garbage. They have WAY WAY too much health, on top of the shield. PICK ONE.\n- I swear chance shrines are bugged and I fail 80% of the time now. My friends I play co-op agree. \n- A simple bug, the primary attack the Vagrants do are unable to be attacked in multiplayer. This has been since day 1 of the DLC. \n- The new small worms are overtuned, and are basically to be ignored if gilded and you're not meme-tier broken. \n\nIt's been nearly a month since the last patch and my most of my complaints still exist. \nAll of this leads to the game feeling WORSE after the one or two patches AFTER the game broke from the DLC. They then have let the game sit without any real fixes for i believe 3+ weeks... AFTER TAKING EVERYONE'S MONEY. \n",

ROR2 very quickly became one of my, if not my favorite game of all time. The concept, stages, characters, soundtrack, lore... I wouldn't even know where to begin praising this game if I tried. (okay, that's a lie, I'd start with the soundtrack, Chris Christodoulou is a genius) \n\nThis is the first the time in a while that I'm actually addicted to a game that's *genuinely* fun. Not fun in the way that predatory live service games are, but the type of actual fun that should be the ultimate goal of any video game. I've poured a couple hundred hours into this game already and there will be several hundreds more to come. Also, this game has one of the most dedicated and talented modding communities I have ever seen, ranging from QoL mods to basegame-quality-like characters and stages, so even if you get sick of the base game at some point you're not running out of new content worth checking out any time soon.\n\n Not sure how this game evaded me for so many years, it's fantastic.",

I thought if I got further, unlocked more classes... but 12 hours in and I am done. This game is just not fun to me even with friends. Not sure how it is so highly recommended when there are so many better games in this genre. Maybe get it for a sale at $5-$10 but I would definitely not pay full price for this.",

        "review": "Risk of Rain 2 is a multiplayer roguelike that keeps surprising you every time you play. After putting in over 69 hours, I can say that this game continues to deliver an enjoyable and challenging experience, even after so much time.\n\nGraphics and World Design\nThe transition from 2D in the original game to full 3D in Risk of Rain 2 was handled beautifully. The worlds are vast and detailed, and combined with the atmospheric soundtrack, it creates a sense of endless adventure. However, some enemy designs can feel a bit repetitive after many hours of gameplay.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics\nThe gameplay is fast-paced and satisfying, with each run feeling different due to the randomization of items, enemies, and stages. The variety of characters, each with unique abilities, adds depth and replay ability. Building your character through item stacking is one of the most addictive aspects of the game, as it allows for crazy and overpowered combinations that can change the course of a run.\n\nDifficulty and Challenge\nRisk of Rain 2 is not an easy game. It starts off manageable, but as the difficulty scales over time, the chaos ramps up quickly. The mix of challenging enemies, boss fights, and the constant pressure to find a teleporter before things get too hard keeps the adrenaline high. It's punishing at times, but that's what makes victory feel so rewarding.\n\nMultiplayer Experience\nPlaying with friends enhances the experience significantly. The cooperative nature of the game, combined with the frantic pace, makes it a blast to strategize and survive together. That said, the game can also be enjoyed solo, though the difficulty spikes a bit more.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAfter 69+ hours, Risk of Rain 2 still holds up as an engaging and fun roguelike. While there are moments where certain aspects may feel repetitive, the dynamic gameplay, variety of characters, and chaotic action make it a game that's easy to come back to. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, it's a thrilling challenge that keeps you on your toes.",

I struggle to think of a game that's come out in the past five years that has such unique art and gameplay.  Every character in this game plays completely different from the next and every run can have endless possibilities due to the wealth of items you can find.  I've spent hours trying to unlock alternate abilities for each survivor, get new characters and generally trying to see all the game has to offer.  However, the deeper I go the more I find and its been a while since I've had a game hook me like this. \r\n   \r\n Buy or Pass? \r\n    If you like rogue lites and third person action games: buy this.\r\n    If you dont like to have fun: this isnt for you onto the next.",

The new elites are not fun and unfair.  The new items are poorly designed and just water down the item pool and make runs harder.  While the new stages and music are fantastic they cannot even come close to make up for the absolute assassination that gearbox committed on this game I once loved.  There are items that also genuinely just screw you over, and I'm not talking about the lunars.  The Unstable transmitter has killed me on multiple occasions.  The new survivors are also nothing special.  Seeker is is a buggy mess and her abilities are unintuitive and often get you killed.  Chef is a worse version of the mod that has been out for over a year.  And I haven't even gotten the false son yet.  That leads me to the next problem, the mods.  So many mods are broken because gearbox decided to fuck up the code of the game so badly.  Mods that have worked through every major update now are defunct and most likely will not be updated because why would a mod developer waste their time on fixing a mod for a game that is now worse.  Base risk of rain and the Survivors of the Void are fantastic but i cannot in good faith recommend seekers of the storm.  I will change this review if gearbox ever decided to overhaul the update (unlikely).  I want the best for this game and that means massive changes to the new content.  Gearbox is a spiritually spent money hungry company now so i doubt there will be any updates in the future for this wonderful game.  Here's hoping that I'm wrong but i doubt so.",

This soundtrack feels out of this world, you will levitate listening to ''‚Ä¶con lentitud poderosa'' and if you have played and finished the first Risk of Rain before this one, you'll reach nirvana. Speaking of which, go check the first one's soundtrack too.",

        "review": "Game-Wise:\r\nI really enjoyed this game and what it had to offer. I had some trouble at it first resulting in my FIRST win at a in-game time of 30 Hours (No, I am not referring to the timer within the game like 30 hours on a singular run, jeez, the brain would be begging you to go outside or sleep). Every character played differently with some being very fun, or maybe, a little goofy to use. This game was quite fun just don't rush and soft lock yourself within the Bulwurk Ambry (I think that is what it's called). It sucked when I ruined a good run cause I immediately picked up the Artifact before the rings around it fell, resulting in that ;-; (Or I was just unlucky and the game had a bug/glitch there)\r\n\r\nAchievement-Wise:\r\nSome of the Achievements on this game feel really RNG, specifically the Ethreal and Purified Freedom (SOTS DLC Exclusive). Ethreal is the basically the no-hit challenge with Mercenary but unless you have spent several hours on that one character, you only really have a fighting chance with either trial and error OR what artifacts are being used in the Prismatic Trials. And the other Achievement, well, do you know how hard it is to find a Altar of Gold. I mean yeah you could use the Bazaar to increase your odds but the chances are still low. Either way every Achievement was fun to collect because not only did you do the challenges it had to offer but you were also rewarded in the end with something new. I shall still hate on those TWO specific Achievements I mentioned but overall, 8/10 with Achievements.",

        "review": "At this point I've been playing for a while, so I guess I'll throw my opinions out there.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic. It's the best roguelike I've ever played and I genuinely don't think there's anything out there right now that even comes close. \n\nSeekers of the Storm has its issues. It made multiplayer balancing brutal (if that's something you care about) but the actual content it added is nice. If you're worried about the new Survivors being garbage I implore you to go out and mod the game. Mods give this game infinite replay value and I strongly suggest you go out of your way to try some mods out. \n\nEverything that Hopoo themselves worked on is very polished. Even though Gearbox aren't the best fellas for the job, there will always be people out there who are willing to fix their mistakes. \n\nPlay the damn game.",

I now have to buy the content to regain my 100% completion.\n\nI wouldn't normally be too annoyed by this, but in this case it feels like they saw the wave of negative reviews and are are trying to force a group of players (admittedly probably a small percentage) to buy the DLC to recoup some of their investment.\n\nScummy if true. If it's not true, then why would the achievements not have dropped with the content on Day 1?",

Jumping into this game expecting things to go how you plan is only going to get you frustrated in the end. Treat every death as a lesson, not as a punishment.\n\n(Yeah, Gearbox dropped the ball on Seekers of the Storm, but they have been making an active effort to fix things)",

Tons of unique characters to choose from, fast-paced, challenging gameplay, incredible soundtrack, and tons of replay value.\n\nYou might have heard recently that Gearbox acquired this game and completely ruined it. As of October 2024, most of the bugs have been patched, but Seekers of the Storm is an incredibly lackluster DLC that ruins the item pool quite a bit, and with the corporate greed of Gearbox, the state of the game has been thrown in limbo.\n\nIf you are going to buy this game, I recommend buying only the base game and the Survivors of the Void DLC to get your total money's worth. Really only buy SOTS if you have cash to burn.",

You are now encountering elite enemies right off the bat, and you can encounter elite bosses quite early on. This has made the game very unbalanced, especially for people (like me) who want to play with the melee characters. I'm probably not gonna play it anymore until they fix the game and return it to the way it was.\n\nSo if you are interested in this game, DON'T BUY IT AT THE MOMENT!!! Wait until the next major update and hope they fix the unbalanced enemies.",

I also was really wishing the staff that upgrades character's kits was going to be added, even in the two DLCs that were released, but alas.... Also sold out to gearbox lol.\nStill fun to play but wasted potential thus far. RORR beats it by miles in fun factor, RORR>ROR2>ROR1.\n\n(27th 100%ed game)",

There are so many factors of replayability it's incredible; so many combinations of items with their own synergy that work differently for different characters who give different experiences in their own right. Artifacts adding unique modifiers give you so many ways to change up the gameplay to give you something fresh.\nThe system of progression is something I'm surprised not more games use. Having achievements grant new items and characters rewards the player for playing more and trying to go for different item builds, so there's more than just bragging rights for doing certain tasks.\nThe soundtrack is one of if not the best soundtracks I've ever heard, each track setting an excellent atmosphere that seems to fit no matter the situation.",

They all play solo so they do not care for the masses of multiplayer folks. The game just doesn't work functionally right now. Stay away",

The variety of characters and their respective abilities, combined with the randomness of loot drops throughout the levels, make for every run to be different. At first, I didn't think it would have much replayability, but to my surprise, it did. \n\nI believe this game really shines when played with other people, as going through a journey with friends to reach an overarching goal is always what creates a good multiplayer game. Whether you decide to beat a final boss at the end or trying to last as long as possible while looping, it creates a pleasant atmosphere from the peace of the beginning of runs or the challenging intensity of the late-game. \n\nThere's also many different ways to alter the game to set the atmosphere to what you find best. If you like the relaxing and chill nature of the early-game, go ahead and changes artifacts to something like the Artifact of Command to choose the drops you want. If you enjoy the intensity of challenging waves of enemies, you can enable artifacts like the Artifact of Death to make all players die when any player drops below 0 HP, Artifact of Evolution to make monsters receive items between stages, or Artifact of Vengeance to have evil versions of yourselves become enemies. If you enjoy breaking run monotony (which I feel the artifacts give you the most variety this way). you can enable things like the Artifact of Enigma to change your equipment after each use, Artifact of Metaporphosis to spawn as a random survivor (character you can select), and a few others that drastically change how one would normally play. \n\nThe colorful and potent artsyle, as well as addressing many issues that affect previous rogue-like games (such as a lack of run variety), and interesting multiplayer create a masterpiece that one can enjoy no matter the pace they choose to select.\n\nP.S this was written before Gearbox. I enjoy the passion put into this game by the devs, but not greedy corporations.",

        "review": "First off: I love RoR2! I've played hundreds of hours. If you haven't played it, buy the base game, right now!!! The reviews used to be overwhelmingly positive, until the new DLC tanked it. The base game deserves a high rating. Survivors of the Void DLC is also pretty good, and adds a fair amount of fun content. I recommend it as well. \n\nBUT....\n\nDO NOT BUY Seekers of the Storm DLC. Yes, they fixed some of the bugs that were glaringly apparent at launch, but it's still completely under-cooked and uninspired. First, let's talk about the price. $15 is insane for an expansion of a handful of maps, 3 half-baked playable characters, and however many items (17 I think), when the base games is around $25 or less.  You aren't getting anywhere near double the content of the base game, yet they're asking you to pay more than half of the base game cost. \n\nThe new maps are just okay, but probably the best part of the DLC. A couple of them are well designed and fun, and a couple are the opposite. \n\nThe new characters feel like modded characters. Modded characters aren't polished, many of them are still fun as hell to play, but they all have one thing in common that makes the lack of polish acceptable; the're FREE!!!!!!!!!    The new characters are severely lacking in creativity and polish. Worse than that, they aren't really unique. They all kind of feel like an amalgamation of already existing characters, but not in a fun way. I found them boring. \n\nFor me, the worst part of the DLC is the new items. They aren't fun. Most of them are defensive, so you almost don't even notice their effects. They don't make you feel more powerful when you get them. Some of them are just objectively pointless. For example: Knockback Fin. Causes enemies to pop up in the air like 5 feet when hit. What could possibly be the purpose of this? If anything, it's a hindrance. More often than not, an enemy is launched and then you miss them with subsequent shots. Dumb. I find myself avoiding almost all of the new items. Again, there are a ton of mods for items if you want to spice things up, but for FREE. \n\nTo be clear; I don't mind paying for content. I want to support games that I spend a lot of time playing. But, nobody wants to be taken advantage of, and that's what this feels like. It feels like they leveraged the community's love for the game to price gouge and put out a product that would take just long enough to realize how bad it is that you won't be able to refund it. You'll spend 2 hours hoping that there's more, just to find out it's too late, and you're a sucker. \n\nI see myself as one of RoR2's biggest fans. I've loved it since early access, and I still do. Corporate greed has just gotten the better of the new DLC. Yes, Gearbox released a statement promising to make it right, but don't give them your money until they deliver. They've done literally the bare minimum so far, which is fix stuff that shouldn't have been released in the first place. The sell now, fix later model has got to stop. It's BS. I'm tired of it. You're tired of it. You're going to see a lot of reviews saying to cut the devs a break and it's going to get better. I'll cut the devs a break when they give us $15 of content. Right now, I see it only as a cash grab. \n\nI will change my review to positive if/when the devs deliver on their promises.",

But then suddenly I was married to my wife when I was a little boy... she always nagged me about playing Alert of water, but I loved it. So then, I went to the law firm and filed a divorce against her. She was very unhappy. After that whole thing, I hopped on the new sequel called Take a Chance of Precipitation Deuce. I played it all day and all night for forty nights and forty days. It really helped my marridged. I love Eminent Threat of Dihydrogen Monoxide x 9.81m/s^2 Deuce, but CogwheelCube ruined it. I had so much fun until the  WheelLoge bought Threat of Water two times's IP and my marridge documents. In the conclusion, I just lost my dog and she used to me on my selfphone. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk. Plese dont bye Hazard of Pelting H2O Second.",

It's still a great fun game and people love to complain.",

        "review": "would be the greatest game of all time with steam workshop support. the mods are fantastic, highly recommend playing it modded, you can play as goku, soldier from tf2, & sonic the hedgehog among many others, there's mods for qol, new items, item reworks, and a ton of other silly shit.\n\nlove the game vanilla though, very fun core gameplay with fantastic survivors and a ton to unlock and explore, gets a little boring past 2 or 3 loops though, because if you're getting that far, everything is dying instantly anyways.\nBoth dlc's are fantastic, both add entire new paths to take in order to beat the game, tons of items (the sots items aren't even bad everyone is hating for absolutely no reason other than knockback fin), and of course new survivors",

The second I opened the game I came in my pants a little i'm going to be completely honest and it just kept giving, every track in the game works so well and it complements and makes the gameplay fucking amazing.\r\n\r\nit's a shame gearbox dropped the worst fucking dlc of all time but I still think this absolutely my favorite game of all time.",

But that doesn't mean that the game is inherently bad now, it's still one of the greatest roguelikes of this generation. Plus I feel like all the bugs and new content that doesn't fit into the old flow of gameplay will be ironed out with time. I was doubtful of this, but they seem to be listening and working to restore the game to what it was which is definitely a good sign. Though no matter what, through thick and thin, this is a game I will always hold close to my heart. The game is just going through some rough times at the moment.",

Joking aside, I loved the first game, and this was a fantastic follow up. My friends and I have this on our permanent rotation of games we're always coming back to. Tons of playtime and content, plenty of bizarre and fun ways to spice things up.\n\nVoid DLC: Excellent addition to the game, new boss is a real challenge for existing meta builds, new worlds are beautiful, and homage continues to be paid to the first game and its established lore. Well done, well worth the money if you play this game regularly\n\nSeekers of the Storm DLC: While initially a little buggy, I picked this DLC up September 16th, and have yet to have a single gameplay issue. I understand others had problems early on, but We have played probably 100 hours or so of the new DLC, in both solo and multiplayer, and have yet to have a problem. The one glitch I noticed is the environment logs from the new Versions of the Ambry are bugged and unlock the log for the old version. Aside from that, haven't had any issues. \n\nTo address criticism, here's the opinion of a long time RoR player. I loved RoR1, and to have the amount of lore and fan service present in the worlds, survivors, and logbooks brought by this DLC was awesome. Chef is back and fun as hell, Seeker is a great compliment to glass cannon survivors, and false son brings a great dynamicism to play that keeps things exciting. I don't at all agree with people saying the new survivors feel flat, or uninspired.\nThe new worlds and path of the storm is an awesome addition and challenge to beat without farming in a timeless world, especially on monsoon and adds another fun side branch to longer runs.\nMany of the new items have quickly become staples, and to those saying some of them are blah, let me remind you that items like the Hunters Harpoon and the Roll of Pennies are OG items and more blah than just about everything in this DLC (except maybe war bonds)\n\n I understand people were unhappy with the initial state of the DLC, but my whole game group is loving it, and no one's had a complaint. Who cares if its made by gearbox now, evidently they give enough of a damn to put in cool things like Providences sword and worms into the hatchery, deeper lore to the logbook entries giving us more insight into the brothers relationship, and new worlds that differ significantly from the ones we have thus far. Let me remind you that some games get no DLC or new content at all.\n\nThis game is an easy 10/10 recommend from me, and the DLCs if you can spare the cash and like the game are as well. \n\nBring your umbrella, it's a monsoon outside.\n\n",

        "review": "TLDR: I believe Risk of Rain 2 is one of the rare roguelikes that transcends its genre boundaries and placates a much larger demographic. Chances are, you'll love this game one way or another.\n\n[h3]Balance[/h3]\nI'm going to ignore prismatic trials, and all the weird wacky side content because I haven't really tried it. There are 3 game modes, that will surely encapsulate your preferred difficulty. Baby mode, human being mode, and testosterone supreme. I haven't trimmed my neckbeard in a little while so I prefer the latter, but every game mode escalates in a exponential curve, so you will find a way to lose one way or another. When you are choosing your difficulty it's really about how much time you want to spend on your run - I believe there is a healthy challenge in this game for everyone.\n\nIn every roguelike there must be RNG swings. Risk of rain has ups and downs, but a veteran of this game will almost certainly make every possible scenario work. In other words, get good :^).\n\n[h3]UI/UX and QoL:[/h3]\nIf you have experienced the soul-crushing experience of dying on the 1st stage of this game's predecessor, you know how short runs can be. Risk of Rain 2 sacrifices the ludicrous difficulty for a more tenable difficulty curve, at the price of longer - and sometimes tediously long runs. Introducing the zeitgeist of the Risk of Rain 2 Gearbox era: the pause button. Who knew the 60 lines of code to pause threads would take a studio acqusition to achieve.\n\nThe Risk of Rain franchise lists as one of my top 10 favorites, but unfortunately its pristine game status has pulled the wool of retrospect over the proverbial eyes of the community. This game absolutely needed the QoL and UI/UX changes that gearbox provided. They went mostly under the radar, and I won't cover them all here but just about every gripe I had with this game has been accommodated. Read about it here: https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/4281321170606899294?snr=2___\n\nGearbox has provided other various features to make the game more accessible and transparent to users. Quality design should make information simple at a glance, and entirely transparent upon when scrutinized. You can now read the exact stats of items in game (why didn't this exist before?!). There is still a lot of information you could never possibly hope to acquire except by visiting the wiki, thank God for the dedicated people over there. Post-update UI/UX stands at a 7/10 for me.\n\n[h3] Graphics [/h3]\nI remember when I was invited to play this game upon release. I had no prior exposure, and expected RoR1 with more content and maybe a graphics overhaul. This game looks incredible, at least as good as it can without melting your GPU an hour in (actually it still kind of does). The dev team toed the line between minimalist performance and gorgeous, communicative graphics to make an incredibly stylized style that never sacrifices readability or performance. (PS check the umbrella settings in the gameplay tab that Gearbox added, a lotta good shit!).\n\n[h3] Music [/h3]\nHOLY FU3KIM0LI.\n\nI hear a lot of praise for composers like Mick Gordon. Good game composers will make a reactive set of polygons feel like your Herculean victory story. Risk of Rain 2's composer Chris Christodoulou does the impossible with elated peaks of guitar riffs when you're fighting some titan of realms and the antonymic, quiet, mysterious ambience when you slip into the Bazaar Between Time. Try playing this game muted - it's simply not the same game.\n\nI wanted to slip in a quick excerpt about sound effects and reactive audio. MAN this game makes it satisfying to be powerful. Crits, bleeds, missiles all have different chunky sound effects that make you feel infinitely rewarded for hitting the same boss for 3 minutes. Sound design in this game is one of the best I've seen, for allies and enemies alike. Nothing like the thick dopamine hit of firing a crit on huntress with tri-tips - even though I'm losing the run.\n\n[h1] \"Didn't Gearbox ruin the game?!\" [/h1]\nI tried to consolidate the changes into this section, but their UI/UX design needed to be mentioned. Let's break down the Pros and Cons, without the tribalism of angry gamer speak. There were some hiccups in the DLC release that are worth mentioning, but I was also overall happier with this DLC release than Survivors of the Void. Hear me out.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Aforementioned UI/UX/QoL changes - The biggest Pro IMO\n- Holy CONTENT - Much more than the previous DLC with less price, and new skins for all base characters.\n- New map design (GORGEOUS)\n- The introduction of more revive mechanics - a much needed addition especially for multiplayer\n- A more diluted item pool - it introduces more variety and counteracts the power creep of added void items\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- New items feel poorly thought out, with several having little to no effect. It seems the devs maybe hadn't played this game enough to understand what is desirable in this game.\n- New elites need some tweaks. I have heard some bugs that are absolutely absurd with the spawning of additional Gilded elites, and a late-game elite with percent health damage reflect was simply a poor idea.\n- Some wacky, jagged bits on the new path. The new mini-boss has some bugs and knockback issues that need to be changed. Nothing a few patches won't fix.\n- I was REALLY looking forward to Chef but after a few runs he definitely needs some buffs or an overhaul.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\nGearbox made a mistake, and fixed it quickly. There are still rough edges but the DLC is more than worth the price tag as of this moment. I will get more than an hour of playtime per dollar spent, which is more bang for my buck than most games will promise. Their dev team has been receptive, responsive, and transparent in what has been pointed out. This could have easily been a cash grab after how many sales it has already made, but they have been working hard to accommodate the concerns. Give it a shot; I believe Gearbox could make this franchise even better with time and patience.\n\nAlso I ran out of Pros and Cons but there might be more :P",

Just doesn't let us join lobbies. With crossplay enabled at some point in the game everyone gets disconnected. \n\nSo far as far as I'm aware there's been next to nothing from the devs, so we have no clue when this will be fixed. I'll change the review when it does but until then, I can't play the game and that's unacceptable.",

Negative reviews are mostly backlash on the new DLC (Seekers of The Storm) don't let that back out of a great game.\r\n\r\n2- What about the DLCs?\r\nA: both DLC are a nice addition to the game, but unfortunately you can only see the good polish on Survivors of The Void.\r\nWhile Seekers of The Storm have a Soul and Heart, it was either rushed, or lack of experience by the developers with the New Unified code.\r\nAnd we should be very greatful for Hoopoo Games for implementing the DLC system of this game, because if GearBox was adding the first DLC for sure they would force everyone to buy the DLC to play together, and I really hope more games would come over with this system at MINIMUM.\r\n\r\n3- Should I buy it full price or discounted?\r\nA: If the IP was on Hopoo Games hands i would say Full price to give them a help, but since the IP is on GearBox Hands get when discounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Unfortunately for me, I can't really play it because there is so much BS happening on the screen at any given frame that it literally hurts my eyes.  Mad respect though, I'm simply too weak.\n\nOh, also the soundtrack is absolutely killer.\n\n7/10",

        "review": "Gearbox took a game with overwhelmingly positive reviews and tore it down with a single DLC. Don't support gearbox, ignore the DLC and just play Survivors of the Void + Base Game instead. This game is incredible with the amount of content/secrets and the like, always fun to play and unlock the survivors/new abilities for them. Gearbox is washed and we need to make sure they never forget it. Gearbox owns the IP now, so the next DLC will like be a broken and buggy bowl of plain noodle water and so will the one after that. Sad to see. Also, even if the DLC wasn't broken, it's very very mid anyways, watch a review on YT to find out why.",

        "review": "The game is allegedly running well post-Seekers DLC. It has a well established modding scene for endless replayablilty and has an AMAZING soundtrack by Chris Chris the absolute goat, which remains one of my most listened soundtracks to this day.\n\nHowever I can't in good faith recommend this game as Gearbox has set an awful precedent for their first update after purchasing the IP. They allowed it to be shipped in a disgraceful state, with completely broken game code and a laundry list of reproducible bugs that should not have gotten past QA. Modders have even thrown up hands and retired from the game due to how egregiously Gearbox tore the code a new one. This was even after the update had been delayed and cut into two parts, which had its own fair share of bugs that never got hotfixed until the full release.\n\nOn a personal level, one of the biggest draws of the game was the worldbuilding, where lore is spread out over environmental storytelling and sparse details over many logbook entries. Hopoo employed a lot of showing, not telling, not unlike the Fromsoft games. Unfortunately Gearbox came out the gates flailing with their first announcement trailer introducing voiced dialogue and filling in the blanks which Hopoo so carefully left up to interpretation, such as pseudo-retconning the ending of the first game to fit their new epic. Subtlety was never their strong suit (see: Borderlands), and the mystique of the world was tarnished in the process. It was like someone took over the Half Life franchise and let Gordon be voiced by Nolan North because they didn't understand the point of a silent protagonist nor have they the creative bearing to write around them.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for my interest in the franchise was how Gearbox's massive blunder has caused a rift in the community. With all the criticism proliferating the airwaves a number of apologists has taken it upon themselves to push back against the negativity on behalf of Gearbox, pleading for others to change their reviews and shooting down any form of criticism of the game as issues the developers will inevitably fix. In any case, the whole mess reeks of poor management from Big G and I'd rather go back to supporting indie developers who treat their games with love and respect.\n\nI'm still putting the soundtrack on repeat though. It's just that good.",

        "review": "i love this game. i had sunk many hours into this game before SOTS and will continue to do so even in spite of my dislike for the new update - but gearbox's design vision for SOTS, and the changes to the game outside of it in its newest updates, have made the game much harder from a balance perspective. and it's in a way that makes the game tangibly worse than the very sturdy balance the game was in previously. (v1.2.4 specifically.) i can't recommend the game in the state its in now post-SOTS release because the game just isn't as fun anymore - it constantly ping-pongs between feeling unengaging and cheap. \n\ni like to think 100 hours in that i'm at least okay at the game, though i have favorites i understand the ideals of what each character does and how to optimize a build throughout a run to give yourself the best chance to win. but even if your goal playing on monsoon is just in obliterating - not going for mithrix as i am, just looping to get all the extra character skins and achievements - the amount of enemies you're running into at earlier stages feel so unbalanced. it's noticeably worse than it used to be, spawns are just off the fucking charts. elite elder lemurians at ~15 minutes into a rainstorm run and its even worse on monsoon with boss enemies. (i just had a run ended by three stone titan lasers at once two minutes after spawning into abyssal depths and it didn't feel great!) the new enemies they're throwing at you - specifically the gilded and twisted varieties of old enemies, as well as scorch wurms and the fucking child - have core design ideals that clash so hard with the other well designed enemies, and can make entire runs feel unfun when you die to them. child oneshots are annoying and gilded enemies are damage sponges to a RIDICULOUS degree, but scorch wurms are somehow worse than both with the fact that they're tanky as fuck for no reason, have big hurty AoEs which can hit you in the air, AND cant be attacked while they're burrowing in the ground. actual worst enemy in the game. dogshit on every level.\n\nthe DLC itself, if you buy it at that fat $15 price tag, doesn't even get you anything incredibly exciting - to be fair seeker is an alright character (though not my speed) and false son is fun but was quite broken on release and they're still having to fix shit with him. but chef? lmao. actively bad. the most undertuned character in the entire game. the new areas and boss fight you get feel boring at best and actively annoying at worst - if you loop a couple times climbing up prime meridian to get to him and oneshotting false son can be pretty easy, but approaching it from a timed run perspective many might do for a challenge, like people do against mithrix, makes the entire area's design flaws really stand out. the new boss fight is just a worse mithrix, and isn't fun or engaging in any different metric. i hate the 'run around and touch pillars to get your abilities back' bullshit, and false son's one hit kill beam being able to reach through the walls you're meant to hide behind is deeply tilting at the end of an especially hard run with how hard the game is overall now. the new stages are pretty, and the concept of the new artifact is great - handing down an item from a previous run to a new character's run if you can beat false son - but everything else? only one new equipment thats just a free res, and many of the new items (outside of my love Sale Star, who is forever innocent) either don't even work, aren't good, or are way too situational to add anything to runs. if you're not running Command artifact (which to be fair, i am 90% of the time) your characters are tangibly worse early with how you have to waste time trying to scrap the crap new items which add nothing to your character if you don't want them. and if you just decide to push through with them instead, you get savaged by early game gilded pest or brass contraption. like, wow, my knockback fin really came in clutch there!\n\nwhen RoR2 is at its best it can still be really fun but i'm running into a wall trying to get the 100% completion with the game's balance in the state that it is. monsoon difficulty sucks right now, and i truly feel that after another 15 hours trying to get to grip with the games new balance, it's not me sucking, it's a significant series of design missteps and code issues that have fundamentally altered what was once a pretty fantastic game. between this and turning borderlands into a shell of itself, i hope randy pitchford catches every single red light on his commute home from work, every day, for the rest of his life. if you wanna pick up the game now do so with some caution - this update'll probably get better with time, but gearbox owning this franchise doesn't bode well for its future. coming big content updates might be even worse. enjoy it co-op with friends first, solo is enjoyable still but co-op is where this game's best. vanilla is still great, SOTV's good but SOTS is optional. it has great extensive mod support through thunderstore, try some of those instead!",

There's no steam workshop, but they're are tons of awesome mods through r2modman on Thunderstore.io.  Survivors of the Void is a great dlc that expands on the base game, unfortunately it seems that Seekers of the Storm and any future dlc will be of questionable quality since they're being made by Gearbox instead of Hopoo.  (The recent mixed reviews are because Gearbox released a new dlc that broke many parts of the game, however as of now the bugs have been fixed).  If you enjoy Rogue-Likes I promise this game will be well worth it!",

I would recommend this game 10/10 times if it weren't for the fact that multiplayer on its own just sucks. You either constantly struggle with making a lobby of more than two people (you have to adjust multiple settings, at least in my friends and I's case, just to finally make a three person lobby) or you'll be fourty minutes into a super promising and awesome run just for your game to lag and everybody but the host lag out and get kicked. It's ridiculous and incredibly frustrating and for that it's not worth it.",

Despite the recent update and DLC, the gameplay is still extremely fun, the character playstyles are varied, the environments are pretty, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the items are cool, the enemies have varied designs, and the lore is (oddly enough,) very interesting. \nAs an employee of the UES Safe Travels, your mission is to find out what happened to the Contact Light in the previous game, gathering loot from the scattered crates dropped by the destroyed ship along the way, using Providence's teleporters to travel across Petrichor V. \nThe game currently offers 4 different endings, 16 characters (each with their own unique unlockable abilities), 207 items, 61 enemies, 10 enemy modifiers (\"elites\"), and 28 environments.\nIf you like movement characters, one of the strongest characters in the game heavily relies on movement. If you like precise sniper-like characters, the \"Survivors of the Void\" DLC has you covered, if you like sacrificing health for damage, I recommend getting a friend to help you unlock REX, if you like AOE characters, beat the game and go nuts, if you prefer melee characters, there's a couple options, including the aforementioned movement character.\nThe game had a rough turnout recently under the acquisition of gearbox, but they managed to turn it around and patch most of (if not, all) the bugs, afaik.\nThis has become my favorite game currently, and I cannot stop playing it.\nThere are also two gay lizards in the abandoned aqueduct stage. Very nice.\n10/10 game.",

        "review": "While I love this game, I'm unsure when exactly the difficulty scaled to an impossible high point.  Whether Hopoo did it or Gearbox, but I was unable to play on Monsoon and get high up in levels before dying, and now I cannot get past the lower levels.  The enemy spawn rate is ridiculous, the healing rate they give out is disgusting.\n\nWhether using artifacts or not you just do not get enough items to survive.  Seeker isn't a bad class, but the characters are basically bullet sponges now.  This game is barely enjoyable.  Some enemies can knock you literally across the map and you cannot input any keys.  The \"Xi Construct\" boss attack effects are so bright that it is an epileptic concern.  Not only that but his hit box is horrific, and with the heal rate it's a sickening fight.\n\nHopefully the difficulty, and other aspects are worked on.",

Good job fixing the game breaking bugs I guess, but I can't really say you did a good job for fixing issues that a game developer wouldn't overlook on their first product. Either way the game runs now at least. Now I can feel the absolutely worthless saturation of dogshit new items that don't fit the flow of the game whatsoever. And when I'm done with that I can get one tapped from across the map by my own proc effects by your horrible new twisted elite, or play a bullet sponge simulator against a gilded elite 10 minutes into my run.I shouldn't have to install mods to remove content so the game feels fun to run through.  Literally the only thing this publisher has been good at is destroying previously flourishing gaming communities.  Congrats on your consistency Gearbox",

Gearbox has destroyed the game. Even after two patches to fix problems they created with their DLC, the game does not play how it used to. Enemies are spawning in greater numbers and have quite a bit higher attack speed that pre-SoS. If they ever manage to undo the damage they did, I will gladly change my review to Recommend. Until then, if you don't own this game, don't buy it.",

It feels like 100x times the amount compared to RoR1.\n\nIts hard because I really like a lot of it, but holy moly after playing RoR Returns it shows the cracks in this one.\n",

I have had the pleasure of not seeing the Twisted Elite but my friend did and he got his run ended by one of em. Also the new boss is shite with his ability to take away your abilities.\nI truly love this game and hope for the best since i can't seem to find another roguelike similar to this.\n\n\nDont get new dlc kinda cringe",

We have the time and money to release two full dlc packs with brand new items, maps, and characters, but we cannot for the life of us, add a rejoin game button when disconnected from a multiplayer run. Why am I being disconnected in the first place? I dont know! Though why I cannot even rejoin? I cannot fathom why I fucking can't. You useless fucks, get paid to work on this shit, play your game, go in a run for 80 minutes with your friend, then get disconnected for god knows, and dont rejoin. See how that makes you feel, when it happens 10 damn times. I hate you",

The variety of survivors to play as means there's not a dull moment and there's a play style for every mood. The game has great progression as you unlock new items and characters and has plenty of challenge for all skill levels. Once you've learned the base game, try the alternate game modes for a greater challenge. \n\nRecently Hopoo sold the game to Gearbox.\nGearbox: Don't mess this up. Please.",

Will never forget the amount of times we blew up while one second into starting the teleporter just because we kept messing around instead of playing the game like how youre supposed to play it, or when youre the last person standing because the others got thrown off a cliff. And even playing alone the game is so fun like man, gaming is fun.\r\n10/10 game Mithrix is hot",

I may come back and change this review in the future, but it'd require Gearbox getting their act together and not breaking the game any further than it is. \r\n\r\nThat being said-- Great if you wish to play single player, good luck doing multiplayer however. Kicking party members on lobby launch, FPS based item duping glitches, etc. Very, very silly in it's current state.",

From that time, I can say, without a doubt, Risk of Rain 2 is one of, if not my favorite Rouge-lite. I'd certainly recommend this game to anyone who likes rouge-lites. \nI will say, the game is not balanced, which is not surprising considering how the game works, but if you are looking for any semblance of balance, you wont find it here.\nThe game doesn't really pose much of a challenge, that may just be because of playtime, or the other games I have played, but to anyone who plays a number of games, I doubt they will have any challenge.\nOnto another note, both of the dlc are worth it. Both Sots and Sotv add a multitude of items, and a rather large pool of items. They both add characters, who are all fun to some extent, and new areas, If you like the base game, buy the dlc.",

This is excluding the massive bugs that we shipped out as well as ones that continue. \nI want to talk about how the new characters, item,s enemies, and maps all add nothing of substance to the game but in fact water it down with mediocrity. i have never once played this game with such dispassion as I do with the new DLC. \n\nBASE GAME 10/10\nSotV 7/10\nSotS 2/10",

Now that I've actually tried this game, I can confidently say that this game is an amazing roguelike, that has a nice balance of RNG while still being fair. 9/10 game, 10/10 soundtrack.",

If you're playing in a group, however, be prepared for an hour plus of extremely unbalanced gameplay where some players run away with the game and leave their teammates barely participating. And make sure to have another game system at the ready in case you die, because you'll wind up sitting there while your teammates further widen the gap. When they finally do resurrect you, they'll have gotten so much stronger than you that there's basically no point in you still being there. I played over a dozen runs today, and only had one run over the course of nearly 5 hours that I actually felt I was contributing.\r\n\r\nTL;DR--Multiplayer usually involves 1 or 2 players doing all the work while the other players just sit and watch. When you die, you end up sitting there with nothing to do, and when you respawn, everyone else is significantly stronger than you.",

There is no part of this game I can critique as it does exactly what it intended to do, and it does it perfectly. In comparison to other roguelites, I'd say this is easily top 5. I love this game, it's atmosphere, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet. Also if you have friends that either have the game or want to get it too, the multiplayer experience is phenomenal. While I personally recommend both DLCs as well, if you are to only get one get Survivors of the Void as it is just objectively the better DLC.",

FPS now effects enemy attack speeds and breaks several items, so you literally have to turn your fps to specific limits to try and balance the game. Multiplayer worked until last weeks patch but now the lobby will never take your friends in so thats broken now. Game still wont start for a majority of the playerbase due to teh 3% loading glitch. If you havent played it before 2024 dont start now, you missed the good days.",

        "review": "Pretty simple 3rd person shooter roguelike game. You have 5 floors (I think, mybe there are secret floors as well) and there's a boss and a portal/teleporter on each. You have two unlocked characters to play at the beginning and you unlock more of them like in Isaac and Gungeon. There are no tutorials and story, but it's not hard to learn. You have a lot of pickups and items that can stack, an active item and also 3D printers. I don't get it why you lose all of your money at the start of the next world. It doesn't make much sense to me. Design of the game is nice, but I haven't played it since this new update. I heard players are complaining so I'm gonna check that out as well.",

Gearbox was wrong to put out the dlc so early and some choices were made, but they're working on it, and they're doing a good job. The game itself is a masterpiece, and I can't recommend it more if you like fast paced chaos with skill and knowledge put into an hour of gameplay. the bosses are awesome (except that one), and you can loop to make your runs even more crazy. And while its far from perfect, you can depend on the modding community to fix whatever nitpick you have. Don't just listen to this guy for whether or not you're buying the game or not, but I recommend this game without a shadow of a doubt.",

The newly acquainted Gearbox devs have immediately fumbled on it, and the DLC is also straight 50 50. It's a da*n shame that it's come to this. It's a da*n shame that Hopoo, IMO, has abandoned their game, and any further progress of Risk of Rain 2. It's all a da*n shame.",

This is one of my all-time favorite games and I've been a RoR fan since classic was brand new, but in the current build, the game feels like it's missing it's soul even after the bugfixes pushed by gearbox. I cannot express how disappointed I am to see this handed off from Hopoo games...\n\nIf you enjoy the game, look into downgrading your version to pre survivors of the void builds. The DLC is also an absolute joke for $15. Downgrade and Mod for a better experience than gearbox will ever offer.",

The art style is very unique and the sheer chaos in the late game is so much fun!\r\n\r\nI love the quirky character designs (especially Chef and Rex) and each one has a unique play style. Going for god runs and chasing achievements to unlock the alternate abilities and skins adds a goal-oriented progression that keeps each run interesting!\r\n\r\nIMO this is the best indie game I have ever played and it is awesome to have watched it grow in popularity and gain major studio interest!",
