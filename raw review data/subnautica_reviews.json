But after playing this, I feel like the bar has been raised so high in the ground, that other survival games can only go under water... Sorry for the dad jokes. \n\nI always had fear of oceans. I know...shocking! Who doesn't!? I didn't even knew there was a word for it : Thalassophobia. But after playing and completing this game, I can confidently say: I am never going into the ocean...at least willingly. \n\nFrom the moment you enter the ocean for the first time, you feel a sense of dread about your situation. You feel confused: about your fate, about your objective, basically about everything. But as you start learning about the Planet: it's flora, it's fauna, it's islands, it's lore. You start to get your bearing. And then the game starts becoming fun! It did for me at least. And then the feeling of dread, which is prevalent throughout the first half of the game, is replaced with feeling of wonder and amazement. Which makes this game so awesome.\n\nI am now a fan of these genre of games(Survival games). And I would highly recommend this game to anyone willing, or even daring, to try it.\n\nP.S This game is terrifying for the first half. Like, remove one earphone, to make your brain realize this is a game, kind of terrifying. So be prepared. But after you kill your first leviathan, the game will feel like a big swimming pool, so to say.",

Overall it's a excellent game and its worth it.Once you play the game.....theres no going back.....Are you sure whatever your doing is worth it? Yes......\n",

        "review": "\nSteam Review: Subnautica\n\n⭐☆☆☆☆ (1/5)\n\nThis game is an absolute nightmare. Let’s start with Adam. This guy is the walking definition of an IRL NPC. You know those people who just have no original thoughts? That’s Adam. He constantly asks, “Chagsy, can you show me how to dropship?”—over and over, like he’s stuck in some pyramid scheme loop. I’m 90% sure he’s secretly part of the IRA. He’s always lurking around, acting all suspicious, like he’s about to blow his own cover. The guy moves like someone programmed him to do the bare minimum in life. Just staring blankly at you like a robot, waiting for his next scripted line. No soul, just vibes.\n\nThen we have Ethan. This dude is on another level of awkward. We went to McDonald's once, and there was literally ONE other person in the entire place—on the opposite side of the room. Ethan couldn’t handle it. He straight up refused to finish his meal, all because there was another human being in the same building. I’ve never seen someone so socially broken. And get this—Ethan never wakes up. No matter what you do. You could shake him, throw water at him, scream his name—nothing. The man’s permanently asleep, just lying there, contributing absolutely zero to the world. He might as well be in a coma for how much use he is.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on Chagsy. This guy is ancient—like, practically prehistoric. Grey hair everywhere, and I swear on my life, he’s got barnacles growing on his balls. Yes, barnacles. I don’t know how it happened, but this man has lived through so many decades that he’s practically turning into a piece of the ocean himself. Worst part? Every time he opens his mouth, he starts ranting about immigrants. I swear, the man can’t get through a conversation without bringing it up, and it’s like, dude, we’re just trying to have a normal day here—nobody cares about your outdated opinions on immigration! He’s stuck in the past, and honestly, it’s painful to listen to.\n\nHonestly, with these three clowns around, there’s no way to enjoy anything. Adam’s too busy being suspicious, Ethan’s too busy being unconscious, and Chagsy’s too busy ranting about immigrants to do anything useful. Do not waste your time. This game is cursed.",

Maybe a friend recommended it, or you stumbled across the game by pure chance. Whatever the reason may be, here's what you'll get when playing this game!\r\n\r\n-An awesome community (seriously, one of the nicest Ive been in)\r\n-A scary yet intriguing adventure (I dont usually play scary games much, but when I boot this game I just cant stop playing! I bought it back near the start and Ive beaten the game a few times since, even speedran the game!)\r\n-An awe inspiring expirience through a number of fascinating biomes with alien creatures ranging from cute and pretty to creatures that still terrorize my nightmares almost a decade after I first encountered them!\r\n-A sizeable playtime! (I estimate your first run to be between 24 and 36 hours, though it could end up longer if you take your time a lot, or get scared and procrastinate going to that one place youve been avoiding in your playthrough, whichever that may be.)\r\n-A mix of relaxation and intensity come together in the perfect blend! (This game is definitely something I play to relax, but the scary stuff keeps me on the edge of my chair even when relaxed, its an amazing feeling no other game has come close to for me!)\r\n-10/10 music! (I cant deny I listen to the OST of this game on my music app at least weekly. Its great by itself, but within the game it is simply perfect. I dont know of many other games with music that fits this well within the game. Goosebumps everytime!)\r\n-An eyecatching story! (Story? yes, story! This wonderful horror survival isnt just about surviving, its about saving a planet, and most importantly saving yourself from that planet! The story is generally quite good, but if you want a real kick out of it I recommend reading every PDA entry, because god almighty the devs went to town on some of the lore. In a good way, its awesome, creepy, uncanny, terrifying, and yet so extremely fascinating and intriguing!)\r\n\r\nNow, if I could recommend you one game to play you might not have already played before, it'd be this game. Seriously, get yourself a copy of this groundbreaking underwater masterpiece and join the community!\r\n\r\nP.S. if you find my time capsule, take good care of my boys. They kept me going when nothing else would within this endlessly spanning seagrave.\r\n",

The game excels at evoking curiosity and encouraging exploration, pushing you to uncover more of its mysterious world at your own pace. If you prefer a more structured experience, you might lean toward Subnautica: Below Zero, which offers A LOT more guidance. However, if you enjoy discovering things on your own, the original Subnautica thrives on letting you navigate its challenges without holding your hand.\n\nA significant portion of my time with Subnautica has been spent in VR While the game does offer basic VR support, allowing you to use a headset and a gamepad, the experience is greatly enhanced with the \"SubmersedVR\" mod. This mod introduces motion controls, one of the better VR mods I've encountered in any game.",

I must say this game is visually stunning and the sound design is incredible the fear of every noise around you as you descend deeper into the abyss is terrifying. The lore for this game is amazing too i enjoyed exploring each area and finding out what had happened to the planet. Also building bases once getting the hang of it was amazing.  I managed to go through the game with 0 bugs up until the final part and my sub was taking damage from an invisble entity but after a while that sorted itself out once i went further out. This game is a 10/10, i would recommend it to anyone.",

Nope... every time I'd get roughly 20 to 25 hours into a run, the game would start freezing up to the point it was unplayable. After about the fourth try of 20 plus hours, I was done. Did a quick run and somehow managed to get all the achievements speed running my way through before it became unplayable again, but good luck playing a normal game. Also spent about a dozen hours clearing caches and all the other \"tricks\" to get it to work, to no avail, and finally just gave up in frustration. Would have recommended this for sure if it was playable. Such an amazing game ruined by bugs and crashes...",

The leviathins are what make this game and that is great because each and everyone of them is extremely well made and they are terrifying when it comes to big three. The game has beautiful look and each area looks amazing, the vibrant colors make each and everyone of the zones no matter how devoid of light look bright and colorful. Congratulations on outworlds for making such a good game.",

The environment, the graphics, the setting, everything about it really sucks you into the world that you’re in. You’re dropped into a huge ocean with no clue what’s going on. You explore the ocean to unlock wtf happened, and you start out in a shallow/non hostile area. As you explore the ocean and its many biomes youll unlock things that can help you craft items that’ll let you explore the deeper parts of the ocean (and deep and pretty fucking hostile it gets), such as higher oxygen tanks and even sea vehicles. You’ll eventually craft a base where you can set up shop to further increase your survivability. Overall, the setting, the environment and the overall ocean experience leads to one of the most immersive survival games I’ve played.",

        "review": "Seaglide ran out of juice.\nReaper leviathan appears out of no where last second.\n10/10 my fears of the ocean have been justified\n\nStory: 7/10\nReason it's sort of low is because there is only one ending, I feel like it would be heaps better if you could have different endings like if you stay on the planet for too long or something like that. But the reason it's also kind of high is because it has really good plot twists, unexpected areas of entertainment like previous lifeforms and the lifepods are just an added bonus to see what happened to the rest of the crew.\n\nAnimations, Cutscenes and Gameplay: 7/10\nOnce again a 7/10. The animations are really good and the overall gameplay is an incredible mix of fear and suspense while also making it fun and pretty decently grindy. Not too much grind but not, not enough. However, I think the crafting of some items seem absurd or too easy. For example for a Seamoth it's a single plasteel ingot which is 1 titanium ingot and 3 lithium. I think judging by the size of the Seamoth in this example, it should be something like maybe 3 plasteel ingots. Although, UW might not have done this because it would have made the game too grindy possibly. I did find, finding lithium pretty hard but that could just be poor spawn RNG. Also there's only one cutscene lmao and thats at the beginning at the game.\n\nReplayability/Mods: 9/10\nSubnautica has HEAPS of things you could do. Despite the fact that you could platinum the game to get your hours up, you could also start projects like building a base in the void, trying to collect one of every material, scan everything that is scannable or even try to hatch all hatchables. The mods that are capable to be installed are also an amazing addon to this such as mods that induce more fear like \"De-Extinction\"\n\n\nOverall an amazing game 8.5/10 would recommend.",

Initially bought this for my nephew, found myself buying a copy shortly after watching him play. \r\nVery few games have made me pause to appreciate the art design. This is one of them. The sound effects and sound tracks are extremely well done. This game captures the appeal of a bioluminescent reefs and the terror of deep sea cave diving very well. Hell, even coming close to drowning because you got lost in a shallow water cave is an experience. \r\nIf want a game to immerse yourself (pun intended) in for a couple weeks grab this one. Bought twice for 60$, definitely worth 20-30$ when on sale.",

I love how so few \"enemies\" feel like traditional video game foes. Rather, they feel like actual animals whose behaviors you have to discover for yourself. There's a wonderful dynamic throughout of uneasy coexistence with dangerous predators; sure, you might encounter a shark in an irl ocean, but that doesn't guarantee it'll attack you, and you're under no obligation to bother it either. The slow spiral of going down down down, deeper and deeper, necessitating the construction of hardier submersibles, and encountering new biomes and creatures and materials as you descend makes for truly top-notch exploration.\r\n\r\nSubnautica is held back primarily by technical limitations -- the LOD pop-in that would be forgivable in most other games feels egregious when the environments are this lavishly crafted. Inventory management can also be a bit awkward when you're trying to move large quantities of material. Other than that, I have no real complaints.\r\n\r\nA fantastic game from start to finish. My only regret is that I waited this long to play it.",

The creature design is also great, every creature is unique and detailed.\r\n\r\n[b]Gameplay: 8/10.[/b] The actual gameplay is really nice, piloting a big vehicle, exploring, base building and everything is simply just fun.\r\n\r\n[b]Replayability: 9.5/10.[/b] Including my console and PC hours at the time of writing this I have around 120 hours in-game, I've played through the game about 3-5 times by now, to say the least its fairly replayable.\r\n\r\n[b]Summary.[/b]\r\n[b]9.5/10[/b]\r\nThe game has a loveable style of graphics, a great story, fun exploration, outstanding atmosphere and so much more. Subnautica is a very unique and overall fresh game, I would definitely say the experience more than worth its price and would recommend this to anyone looking for a good fresh game to play.",

        "review": "Great game if you like Survial/Exploration/Horror games with little hand holding. 9/10.\r\nI took my time, explored everything, built everything - in fact in multiple locations. The game is a little bit grindy (which it should be in a survival game), especially with regards to food and water, but that makes it that more satisfactory when you eventually get to manage your daily needs with minimum effort. The \"grindy-ness\" is more than forgiven due to the beautiful world in which it takes place. There is very little hand holding in this game, which I like very much. Most things, I discovered by exploring absolutely everything/everywhere, I only had to look 1 or 2 things up on the internet, after many hours of exploration, during my 200 hours playthrough. Bugs were minor, never had a crash. Only 1 savegame, though, so save only in situations when you are absolutely safe (like in a base etc). I had to learn that the hard way ;-)",

        "review": "The game starts off feeling minor, but the moment you dive into the ocean, there’s a magical sense of wonder, quickly followed by a feeling of terror as you progress. It’s a beautiful balance of exploration and fear, and while you eventually overcome your initial worries, the creatures of the deep should never be taken lightly. The gameplay offers a decent balance, but the unreliable scanner can be frustrating—it often fails to scan essential items properly, leaving you stuck with incomplete progress. Despite this, when the game functions as intended, the experience is smooth and immersive.\n\nThe world-building is impressive at first. You’re struck by the vastness of the ocean and its secrets, but as the game progresses and you become familiar with your surroundings, the world starts to feel smaller. Still, the story is well-paced and doesn’t overshadow the core survival mechanics. You can choose how deeply to dive into the lore while simply trying to survive, which keeps things engaging without feeling forced.\n\nGraphically, the game starts with a somewhat cartoonish feel, reminiscent of Astroneer or No Man’s Sky, but this style becomes fitting as you play. It doesn’t detract from the overall experience and feels more appropriate the longer you explore. The sound design is solid—there’s some well-done voice acting throughout—but I can’t comment much on the music, as I turned it off early on.\n\nIn addition to the scanner bug, I encountered another issue where, after starting a new save, I kept finding the same fragment repeatedly, which made progression nearly impossible. These two bugs could use some polish, even after all these years.\n\nOne standout feature is how the game forces you to manage the depths of the ocean, adding a new challenge to survival as you navigate through its different layers. Additionally, the lack of typical weaponry—aside from a mostly harmless knife—creates a unique atmosphere where you can't just overpower your foes. Instead, you learn to master the environment and its creatures.",

It is an experience like no other, with an amazing base building system, awesome scary moments (I know that this isn't a horror game but it kinda is), and a way to overcome your fear of the ocean (or worsen it). I can't wait for Subnautica 2, it's gonna be so epic. Please buy this game the peak is unbelievable.",

        "review": "One of the best survival games out there. It’s got all the elements of survival games, yet the unique spin of it being underwater makes it so much better and less bland. A lot of survival games seem fun, but playing them tend to be boring and kinda feeling unfinished. Subnautica on the other hand, is super fleshed out and so detailed. \n\nThere are so many different biomes in this game, making it truely feel like you’re in a living world. The atmosphere is great, the environment is great, EVERYTHING IS GREAT. Well, the game can still be buggy, fish swimming through walls and junk. This game truely requires you to save a lot in case a game breaking bug occurs, which is kinda sucky.\n\nBut when the game isn’t buggy, it’s an amazing experience. I love how the game doesn’t really tell you what to do (most of the time). To progress in the game, you’ll explore near areas which the game will tell you to go, but rather it being like “go to point A to progress”, it’s “go to a sunken lifepod”, to which you progress by exploring near it.\n\nThe game is also terrifying. The atmosphere and sounds with not knowing what’s next, while only seeing a shadow and scream of something in the distance makes this game so bone chilling. I’ve finished the game 3 times, and I still get terrified getting into the Aurora with the sounds near by, knowing something is lurking. \n\nI definitely say that this game is one of my favourites, and is such a fun one to replay.",

Easy and straightforward game mechanics that are just enough to make you feel like you did something without crossing the border of \"omg I just wasted so much time for nothing\" \n\nIt's not ragey. Just save your game before you choose to have a tickle fight with some reapers (and quit before you die) \n\nStory doesn't keep you in a choke hold. You can explore on your own terms which progresses the story. Building is super easy to figure out. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I love how streamlined this game is. A lot of the time, when a game is good at one thing, it's lacking in the other. But this game is just genuinely good overall. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "review": "It has become rare that a game drops you into an unknown world, and motivates you to explore it in the most positive way. \"Subnautica\" does exactly that, and reminds me of days, when games where an immersive step into another world, with everything else fading away completely. There are those games out there, especially in modern world, where you can play and create any idea that comes to your mind. But when you find them, it's a true gift. Here's what fascinated me the most in \"Subnautica\":\n\n+ a world so small and so big that you get the lost-in-another-world-feeling immediately, with aesthetics that are so beautiful, minimalistic and detailed at the same time\n+ a rewarding gameplay with almost no tutorial, but with every step bringing you further in the game - get to know how to get yourself food, ore, electronic materials, better equipment to uncover more parts of the depth, ... it's unbelievable how much exploration is packed into this game\n+ a chilling experience, which might sound weird thinking of that you try to survive on a foreign planet. But \"Subnautica\" is so slow paced (in the most positive way) that I easily played hours forgetting time completely, feeling an inner soothing. Thank you, devs!\n\nHand on my heart: I was never into crafting games. I even avoided to create potions in RPGs, skipping any alchemist or smithing or whatever ability. But after \"Subnautica\", I feel ready to explore whole new genres (same happened with \"Humankind\" which converted me to 4X games). But I'm sure that \"Subnautica\" will take a prime place in my gaming heart, and ... well, ... it always reminds me on older days with \"Aquanaut's Holiday\" on my PSX, too.",

        "review": "Great \"Immersive\" (see what I did there) game. I have been a scuba diver and clearly the developers have as well. There is a real authenticity to the experiences of being underwater, entering and leaving the underwater environments and how looking up at the sky or down to the depths look in real life as well. The game is addictive and fun and not glitchy at all on mac. There was a lot of talk in the community about it being glitchy and I have only seen one crash in over a thousand hours of gameplay. Very worth it if you like survival games and base building. Fun and mysterious storyline, spooked me once or twice. (granted I am a jump scare waiting to happen). Have fun, pay attention to all the details, read an reread all the messages you get.",

I half enjoyed the last ten. \n\nPRO: \n- exploration is incredible \n- the gameplay loop is simple, but fun \n- that which lurks deep in the ocean is hella scary \n- there's a quick clip of unlocking new stuff, which makes you feel more powerful \n\nCONS \n- for me, the endgame was mostly ferrying resources from one place to the next \n- there are times where it feels like the game *wants* you to ferry resources \n- on the macro level, you have a list of resources that you have to move from place to place; on the micro level, you must have the resources *in your personal inventory* to craft. Which means, you're ferrying resources to lockers in your bases, and then ferrying those resources from those lockers back-and-forth between your personal inventory to craft. \n\nMy suggestion: \n- buy this game \n- download the mod(s) that lets fabricators pull from all lockers within a base",

This game instantly captivated me with its incredible story, stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, and unique soundtrack. The concept itself is truly original. Personally, I’ve been following this game since the very beginning, and it has undergone tremendous changes over time. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games set in a futuristic world. In Subnautica, you crash-land on an alien planet, and from there, you must fight for survival while exploring the depths of a water-covered planet. Your ultimate goal is to find a way back home after your spaceship crashes. If you're a fan of adventure and survival with a strong sci-fi twist, this game is a must-try.",

        "review": "[h1]My rating: 9.5/10[/h1]\nOne of the most intriguing and captivating games I have ever played!\nSince having watched the \"Abyss\" as a teenager, I've been dreaming of an adventure game capturing that atmosphere. And here it is - even in ways better than that movie.\nJust completed the whole storyline after 180 hrs of gameplay, and I probably won't stop: I'll go back to my last save before leaving the planet, and continue exploring and building.\n\nIn terms of immersity and atmosphere, it competes to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328670/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition/]Mass Effect 1/2/3[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/727/The_Witcher_Trilogy/]The Witcher Trilogy[/url] in my personal ranking (though being of a different genre, of course).\nA more suitable comparison is perhaps [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/313630/The_Solus_Project/]The Solus Project[/url] - a rather unnoticed game which I've played some time ago and also enjoyed very much, in contrary to many others ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058359314/recommended/313630?snr=1_5_9__402]see my review[/url]). But I didn't quite like its harshness and enforced dark, pessimistic ending.\nSubnautica is different: While being officially a \"survival\" game, with lots of challenges and threats, it never becomes too dark, too brutal and too unforgiving like many other \"survival games\". It is more about exploring and discovering a strange world that's neither good nor evil, but just working by itself. Just like we imagine the deep ocean. I prefer storytelling and atmosphere over plain \"combat actions\", and this is where Subnautica is shining for me.\n\nFor instance: All those predators throughout the vast ocean, for which you have to take so much caution... well, of course they are dangerous and threatening (which is a vital part of the game, this has to be that way). But at the same time, they rarely get dominant or \"sadistic\", because that wouldn't be realistic for real nature predators. You learn to avoid them most of the time by adapting to their patterns. And should that fail, then they usually take their one or two attacks, and then leave off (I've played on normal difficulty settings).\nI found that fascinating, because my understand was: I am not their prey, I am just a nuisance or threat to their territory. So why should they want to eat me or chase me to the end of the ocean? Of course they don't. If I behave in the best adapted way, I can stay comparably safe. Just like I imagine it in real wildlife exploring.\n\nOne other thing that surprised me: It is one of the very few lengthy games I have played without ANY mods. Never really felt the urge to do so, because the plain game has been so satisfying and exciting.\n\nAnd last but not least, the overall game seems very stable and technically polished. The possible flaws I encountered were so few that I have trouble remembering them.\nThe most prominent one (for which I am giving only a 9.5 out of 10): Scanner room lists get reset with every game start, forcing you to use cameras over and over again to find urgently needed resources. Seems to be a known bug, which probably won't get fixed anymore (as the game is too old by now). Maybe there's a mod for fixing it? However, I didn't care much. It used to be some nuisance somewhere during mid-game, but I learned to ignore it. Everything else was so great, compensating for it!",

And by horror, I don't mean this is an actual horror game. But being trapped underwater with big things sneaking up on you is scary.\n\nBasebuilding was fine at best. It didn't really matter that much. The upgrades were good though, and it really felt rewarding to get upgrades and sometimes you have to chose between sidegrades instead. I wasn't that much fan of the story. It felt like it was just there to make you progress to through the game. The survival wasn't that great as well. Surviving the hostile fish wasn't that difficult and getting food and water quickly became easy.\n\nIn the end, if you are into exploration and building big bases for fun rather than building big bases because they are useful, you may indeed enjoy the game. On the other hand, if you like bases that \"matters\" or games where surviving is difficult, this may not be the game for you.\n\n I also recommend buying the sub zero version if you really love this game. hoping for more improvement and more mods to create give love to the developers  <3",

The story is mysterious and you have to dig to find out what happend and to progress in the game. The resources are well balenced and its always a fund and unique expirience to gather the materials to craft what you need. The open world is huge, exotic and exciting in all three dimensions.\r\nThe graphics arent the best compared to recent titles but it has its own charm I think. There are a few bugs and sometimes the movement isnt that smoth but thats are just little things.\r\nIt is great replayable.\r\n\r\nPS: I completed the game in 26 hours here but I played it before on another steam account so I knew what to do. As a new player you need about 35 to 40 hours I think. \r\n",

I love the freedom, the story, the easter eggs, the building, every aspect of this game was extremely fun and kept me entertained for hours. Some of the exploration was frustrating at times but oh, was it so rewarding to find exactly what you were looking for! I managed to destroy 5 Seamoths during my play through by the way. Is that a record? The one thing I didn't like was building the ship at the end. After all the discovery and exploration, the last thing I wanted to do was material farm. But that is a SMALL complaint in comparison to one of the best games I have ever played so far. \n\n9.7/10",

The keyword was \"Used\". Subnautica has given me a fear of the ocean and I LOVE it.\nThis game is amazing, the story behind it is top notch just to the point where you can tell that the developers put a lot of time and effort into this game. The creatures in this game have made me shit my pants more than 5 times. If you are a fan of games where you actually need to put effort in, and you don't mind getting scared, this game is for you.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, I have only completed about 52% according to the achievements. I cannot wait to finish this game, and play Subnautica: Below Zero.\n\nMy final thoughts on the game:\nIf you have the money it is totally worth it, the amount of mods that can be added to the game makes this game one of the best games you will probably ever play. I cannot wait to finish this game.\n\n10/10",

If you haven't played and are reading this, stop reading and go play it.\r\n\r\nThe biggest criticism I had was that the ocean wasn't quite as alien as I wanted it to be. You can often intuitively guess as to what's dangerous and how dangerous based on how it looks and sounds. The life doesn't always look all that different from something you might see on Earth. Other than that I just want more experiences like this.",

I started out afraid to venture deeper into the sea but as more time passed I slowly managed to get over the fear of the unknown. It's an excellent open world survival game with its rich exploration and lore. I highly recommend the game especially if you have thalassophobia. The experience with the fear really compliments the horror aspects of the game.",

        "review": "[h1]Complete Immersion[/h1]\n \n[i]There will be a TL;DR at the end.[/i]\n \n~\n \nI’m at a loss of words, really.\nI’ll just ramble, because this game really got to me.\n\n[i]Subnautica[/i] has blown me away completely. It not only hooked me to the point where I binged it like that one [b]Netflix[/b] show you could never turn off - but it actually made me [i][b]feel[/b][/i].\n\nThere’s a lot to say about the core loop that has been done to death by everyone the world round - how it’s an interesting, hand-crafted open world with pretty visuals (and arguably the best sound design in any videogame I’ve ever played)\n\nBut it really took me a while to sink into the experience only to step away from my computer, popping out for some air and reflecting when I realized… I never saw a single loading screen, there were no cutscenes, I never left the perspective of my character, even in menus I never separated from the world or felt my legs swept out from under me. It was a constant, seamless, and elegant experience through and through.\n\nI did look at the wiki a few times getting through this game, there were many things to wonder about and fret over - but there wasn’t much the game offered that I couldn't do myself if I had wanted. It was organic on an essential scale. Expanding the area of influence the player has, being invited further and further away by SOS signals, being enticed by the plot to solve simple problems with slightly complicated solutions.\n\nI made more than a couple of ‘shopping lists’ where I’d leave my base and harvest a certain sum of materials to haul back home. I enjoyed my time out and became familiar with the nearest biomes, only steeping my toes into the ‘[b]deep end[/b]’ of the maps with scary surroundings and deadly leviathans lurking about.\n\nThe enemies that should be scary ARE scary by nature. The fish that are supposed to be cute and wacky are adorable and characteristic.\n\nThe sound, oh wow the sound. I play the music in my car now. The audio is top shelf, and the PDAs you come across breadcrumb story beats with recorded audio logs - and the performances are on par with the likes of [b]Bioshock[/b]!\n\nI’m a huge fan of [b]Far Cry 3[/b] and [b]The Forest[/b] - and I have to say that [i]Subnautica[/i] blends a lot of different strengths while exuding its own original charm, design, and power.\n\nSubnautica isn’t a mere copycat - it has a firm presence, a solid core, outstanding presentation, and a path that is both linear in execution and profound in capability. A person could easily play through this game in 20 hours, maybe even half that if they knew what they were doing and streamlined things for themselves. I’m glad I took the long way.\n\nI left my Cyclops and Prawn deep in the recesses of the magma fields for future explorers to happen across. My base continues to run its idle lights to keep its indoor crop farms satisfied with a nuclear reactor - and all the aquarium fishes let loose. I put my prized possessions in a locker by my bed in case another soul comes along sometime in the future. I put beacons in all the places of interest. I waved goodbye to my precious Cuddlefish pet.\n\nThrough it all, I engaged with something truly profound. I was mindful and present when things were dull, when they were peaceful, when there was peril, when there was tension, when there was trial or ease. I would look down and see my feet, I would feel a sense of pride in my own actions - terror at my own predicaments - frustration at my own folly.\n\nThe game kept expanding further and further, pulling me ever deeper until I could never hope to break the surface again. In a way, I’m deeply satisfied having gone through it. In another, it leaves me hungry for more in a way I believe I will take into the real world in the best of ways.\n\nIt can be rough around the edges, a bit obtuse or cryptic at times, and glitches can make you realize your lack of an autosave feature in the worst of ways.\n\nBut there’s no way those small snags are going to keep the weight of your imagination from surrendering to the undertow surrounding it all.\n \n~\n \n[h3]TL;DR[/h3]\n[b]9.5/10[/b]\n[i]Subnautica[/i] is an [b]Incredible[/b] game.\nIt engages your instincts to make you feel curiosity, wonder, peril, pride, and even joy. You will find yourself smiling, or even gawking as you lean into the glow of your computer screen. While the game is safe for your children, it pulls you under its waves with depth previously unimaginable and designed in such a wickedly smart way. The developers cared, and through it - they bring you the deep end of quality. If this game isn’t in your steam library, you need to change that right now.\nTake a deep breath, feel the heartbeat in your chest.\nYou’re alive, and life is glorious.",

When we don't see the island anymore, the motor randomly dies. You fall off, you can't swim, you take damage and die but you get kayaking and gta dont have that so it is impossible to die. Then we survived. Now we are in the middle of seeing the deepsee. We see a shark and we kill him with our whale killing gun harpoon. We say ez clap we sell sharks for millions of debt. We are now stuck in the ocean and broke af. pepe hands. We find mushrooms, then we meet strange creatures. We see the giant aurora (our jetski) it’s about to explode. We hear a countdown from our jetski saying it’s reached a critical state and is about to explode in 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. lagging voice 0… booom now it’s radioactive to go close to our jetski we need to build a rocket ship then fly away from this planet. We go deeper into the ocean . We find the “old ones” . They have big bodies and are also friendly, well some of them that we found. Now we are going deeper with our mini water car. We don't know what's gonna happen. We go deeper to find a lava shooting an old one that is trying to kill us. we kill it. We find an old old one that is dying. We help her hatch her eggs. She's intelligent. We then get help to get out of there. We now build our rocket ship and leave. ez clap",

It does what it does in an extremely satisfying fashion. \nI have played Planet Crafter before, and I still love that game, but by now it seems like all it ever tried to do was emulate Subnautica. Same gameplay loop (explore, find resources, build, upgrade), but sort of more naturally achieved. The depth mechanic really adds to the overall feelings of fear, discovery and awe. The visuals and sounds are much better than I though they'd be, and the story makes so much sense, you can tell it's polished work.\nWorth every bit of whatever currency you're buying it with.",

        "review": "To be honest, I never liked pure survival sandbox games as they are too overwhelming and long. My previous experience with the forest was not good, I gave up after a couple of hours. I first thought that Subnautica was a horror game, as I read it was scary and had a really nice story. I purchased it when it was on big discount and paid very little ($3-4 I believe) for it, so I was not worried I would not like it. When I tried it, at first I felt overwhelmed by the hugeness of the world and the sea, all the things you have to take care of (food, water, health, oxygen, finding resources to move on, handling the limited storage, finding out what is going on…) is stressful and even annoying, so I was about to quick, similar to what happened to Forest. However, little by little I got used to all the mechanics and was impressed by all the different things you can do to progress in the game, find out what happened, how to escape, making new bases, tools, upgrading your gear and skills, etc… and before I realized I found myself with more than 40 h of gameplay and really hooked. It is so beautiful and so wonderful to get lost in this game and find new places, new materials, new “recipes” to fabricate gear and resources… The freedom you have for doing things, no matter how or when, is amazing. Basically, you can do whatever you want or explore whatever area you want with no time restriction, as long as you do not starve or die of thirst. Your only limitation is the oxygen and the depth in the sea, apart from the specific tools needed in some instances or harms to which you need protection against. The story, radio messages and notes you get in the wreckage gives you bits of the story little by little and makes you want to find more and more. Once you have your base established and know your way in the vast sea, you can finally get to fabricate advanced “ships” to travel further, deeper and faster, collect more new items and depending way less on basic stuff. I became addicted to the scanner tool, discovering the biome, fauna and flora, and the alien structures, the logs from the wreckage, etc. is thrilling. \n\nIf you are not sure about this game, but you like adventures, taking your time to explore things, a good story and are not afraid of darkness, please make yourself a favor and try this game. To me, it was not scary at all, the aggressive fauna mostly leaves you alone or you can outrun them with advance equipment. The worst that can happen is that you are killed and lose most of the collected items, but they will remain at the place of your demise so you can always recover them. The fact that you can save anytime is a plus and helps you take risks without fear. \nTo say a couple of negative things, the rendering distance, or pop-in distance, of objects can ruin your immersion in the game. Sometimes you glimpse a plain seabed and think there is nothing there but sand, however, if you come closer you can see how plants, metal, flora and fauna pop-in in your face as you approach. Some of them are really notorious and annoying, like huge islands or ships or tall plants. Once you get used to it and know the areas perfectly you do not pay attention, but it is something disruptive and a clear limitation. In addition, although you can save anytime, anywhere, which is great, there is only one slot to do so, so you always overwrite your previous save. There is no chance of making more saves in parallel in case if you want to play back. It would be awesome to have the possibility to have more than one slot for saving, If they could solve these things it would make it perfect.\n\nTips for new gamers: Don’t be discouraged, read all the entries in your log (very important to get tips and understand what is going on), take your time (there is no rush), and above everything EXPLORE and INVESTIGATE as much as possible. Save if you are not sure what is ahead of you in case you die. Finally, especially at first when you are very limited in resources and tools, take notes of positions of areas you would like to explore in depth but are not possible at that time (they are too deep, need more storage, dangerous fauna ,specific tools…). Later on in the game this will be easier to mark. ENJOY. \n",

Its not just ooo spooky dark water I cant see through, so you dont have to be afraid of the ocean to get scared. TONS of activities and things to do/find to keep you occupied, enough that it has me addicted. Dont get me started on the setting. Its so flippin beautiful, even the \"scarier\" areas I admire. So many different flora and fauna to scan and learn about. Its almost as if this planet is real. Very well done and very thought out, personally I give this game a 5/5",

Also I have stumble upon few bugs, but not something game breaking. \nI wish the game has quick save/load.

It's like 90 seconds, and it's annoying to have to come back for air when you're just getting into the groove of exploring and treasure hunting. So I had to cheat to get a good gameplay experience--I gave myself infinite oxygen and all the basic materials because hunting for tiny sharts of aluminum is a chore and time-consuming. The greatness of the game is held back by artificial obstacles.",

The world is so amazing that I felt SO SO SO invested in it and if I was doing something boring at work I would find myself drifting into this world in my mind. Such a simple concept but so expertly executed and packaged. Brilliant game. \r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know about other gamers but I felt this game took me on a small spiritual journey to keep pushing myself to go deeper and explore despite being a bit nervous/scared to venture deeper. I was so invested and immersed in this world that it felt so real and I just loved it. \r\n\r\n1 Trillion percent I recommend this game.",

I'd delayed buying this game for some time as I wasn't too keen on a game set nearly entirely underwater but I am happy to say I was completely wrong. \n\nAs survival crafting goes it's pretty much perfect. It looks and plays amazingly, has an interesting story to keep you coming back and an incredible atmosphere. You really have to look pretty hard to find fault with this game.\n\nThe only very minor gripes I have are the occasional fish I have found swimming around the corridors of my base, the inability to cannabilise your lifepod for materials (although I may yet to have discovered something that will let me do that) and the lack of a spear-gun for hunting (which I feel is a bit of glaring omission, I'm sure it must have been considered at some point). So for me the game is 9.5/10 and I will certainly be going back for more in Below Zero once I've finished.\n\nEdit: As I've now nearly finished my first play through of the game I'd like to update this review. The final third of the game is a bit frustrating. I don't want to spoil anything but towards the end of the game the environment changes, and this change of environment necessitates the use of certain pieces of equipment which makes navigating this new environment difficult and slow. There is also a bug which effects this equipment which can result in a loss of collected materials or having to reload an earlier save. This bug has seemingly existed for some time but not been fixed. While not quite game-breaking it's incredibly annoying to have got so far and have to lose a bunch of progress because of a bug.",

Good sense of progression. Has a balance of both cosiness and horror elements depending on the biome. Has a decent coop mod too called Nitrox, although it's very buggy. Below Zero was very disappointing compared to this game.",

I freaking love this game, its progression, its building mechanics (making a home away from home), and that unforgettable moment before you beat the game when you are given the opportunity to reflect on your time spent getting to where you are.

From coral reefs to the darkest abyss, Each dive a journey, a perilous kiss.\r\n\r\nCrafting and building, your base to defend, Exploring the unknown, around every bend. The beauty of biomes, the terror of night, In Subnautica’s realm, both awe and fright.\r\n\r\nA tale unfolds, of a world so deep, Secrets to uncover, promises to keep. With every breath, a new challenge to face, In this underwater, enchanting space.\r\n\r\nSo don your suit, and take the plunge, In Subnautica’s world, where adventures lunge. A game of survival, of beauty and dread, A masterpiece crafted, in the ocean’s bed.",

It has adventure and exploration. It has cool vehicles and base building. And it also has nightmare fuel giant sea monsters that you will see in your nightmares. I recommend this game to people that like survival and exploration games. This game is very similar to Raft but if you were on an alien planet and also instead of sharks there are leviathans that will eat you whole.",

Были моменты, когда казалось, что понял что-то об игре, но сюжетные повороты вносили свои коррективы. Временами игра казалась скучноватой, но это только когда приходится только плавать и собирать одни и те же материалы. Всё остальное время это постройка базы/убежищ, исследование мира, придумывание теорий, где что может лежать. Очень многое в игре продумано до мелочей. Пока прошёл только в режиме `Freedom`.\r\n\r\nНа Линуксе завелась вообще без проблем на максимальной графике.",

        "review": "I really love this game. It's a GREAT game, but I just wasted 38 hours because of a bug that has apparently existed for 3 years with plenty of people complaining about it. It has left myself and other unable to progress the story and complete the game. Spoilers ahead for anyone who hasn't finished the story, as the bug involves a late-game event.\n\n[spoiler] When entering the Sea Emperor Leviathan facility, you're meant to speak with her, figure out you need to help her hatch her babies, and do a number of things to move the story toward its climax. There's an alien arch sitting behind her eggs covered in sand which she is meant to blow away so you can open it with an ion cube. This is where I got stuck, because after speaking with her, instead of swimming around the facility following you when you move toward the eggs, she stands still at the center of the facility and doesn't move. I cannot get her animation to trigger no matter what I do. \n\nI've done a number of things to fix it, including:\n\n- scanning everything, including the eggs, incubator, archway, etc.\n- swimming around the archway and the eggs trying to get her to come to them.\n- leaving the area and coming back.\n- leaving the area, saving, closing game and verifying game files and relaunching.\n- going back to my base, killing my character, and returning to the area.\n\nAbsolutely nothing has worked- and I have not used any command cheats at all during this run, so there's really no reason this should be happening. The only kind of 'oopsie' I did was leave the facility via the moonpool entrance because silly me forgot to bring ion cubes so I went to mine the node in the other room with my prawn suite [having the grappling hook allowed me to go through that entrance]. After coming back, she was bugged. \n\nI am literally so disappointed and angry that this bug has existed this long without being fixed despite how vocal people have been about it. I would advise creating a save just before this encounter with the sea emperor so that if it happens to you, you can at least reload and hope it fixes it. [/spoiler]",

But you will quickly realize that as soon as you are no longer occupied you will feel bored, you need to be busy constantly with tasks. That's the core gameplay loop of the game.\r\n\r\nThe creature design looks interesting and the world itself is really pretty. I love collecting all the fish species to display them in aquariums. Just be careful with the reaper leviathan! It makes a lot of people drop the game :]",

        "review": "Subnautica,\n\nWow, what an emotional rollercoaster this game has been. From the serene beauty of its landscapes to the heart-pounding terror induced by the Reaper Leviathan and Sea Dragon Leviathan, Subnautica is truly a masterpiece. Growing up, I never imagined I’d enjoy a game with underwater mechanics, given the anxiety-inducing moments from old Sonic games where I’d panic as he slowly drowned with that iconic music in the background. But Subnautica is different.\n\nThe game's design can disorient you, whether you’re navigating the Aurora wreck or exploring underwater caves, and that lingering sense of dread as you desperately search for an escape with only 15 seconds of oxygen left is unforgettable. The vehicles you can build add another layer of excitement— the P.R.A.W.N suit is a powerhouse, and grappling onto almost anything is a blast. Fully upgrading it is a game-changer. And let's not forget the Cyclops with its iconic “WELCOME ABOARD CAPTAIN, ALL SYSTEMS ONLINE”— arguably the best line in the game.\n\nOverall, Subnautica has genuinely scared me in a way I didn’t realize was possible. I never considered myself afraid of the deep ocean until I experienced it through this game. Now? Terrified. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. The PDA entries, world design, lore, and sound design are all spectacular. Without a doubt, it's one of my favorite games of all time.",

I have categorized my responses as to allow people to skip to what matters to them, and focus their time on what they wish to read. This message will be the same on all of my reviews so if you've read it once, you need not bother to read again.\n\nGenre: Survival Horror\n\nGame Mechanics: Collect resources, drive vehicles, build bases, eat, drink, manage breathing, heal yourself and repair damage to constructed objects.\n\nPlaystyles: I've beaten the game utilizing a variety of playstyles and have even streamed attempting a base only run. I died on my bases only permadeath run down at the endgame location, but I can assure it is possible to playthrough with only vehicles, and only bases (never operate a vehicle beyond the final one required for the ending to play). My preferred playstyle is to zip around the water like Spiderman in the PRAWN suit.\n\nUnique features: Most survival games have eating, drinking, base building and vehicles. This game is most unique in the fact that you are not intended to kill any of the enemies. You can, but honestly it's much more efficient to simply avoid, deter, or play cat and mouse with them.\n\nMy general opinion: Absolutely one of the best single player survival games to ever be made. I love this game, and countless others have too. If you want to enjoy diving on an alien planet, search no further, this is the game for you.\n\nOverall Rating: 10/10",

        "review": "[h1] Thalassophobia: The Game [/h1]\n\n[b]Subnautica might be one of the best games within the 'open-world survival-craft' genre that I have ever played.[/b]\nIt's not perfect -- I do have a few notable criticisms for the game. But there's just so much worth loving that I find it difficult to not just endlessly gush and rave about the game.\n\nThe whole gameplay loop is so fundamentally enjoyable that it ultimately truly emphasizes the \"[b]fun[/b]\" in \"pro[b]fun[/b]dal\".\nNo, but it really manages to keep a continuously consistent seamless experience interwoven between the act of 'progression' and also 'enjoyability', as you're always progressing and you're always having fun.\nThere's always something to do, always a goal pulling and pushing you forward. Never even for a second was I stumped as to what to do next, it kept me fully enthralled throughout the whole experience.\nGrinding isn't obtusely emphasized, instead far more relaxed and feeling more like the occasional punctuation to lull through the different, beautiful vistas of the world.\nAnd I ended up engaging myself quite a lot in the entire base-building aspect, as I found the whole system to be surprisingly really fun, honestly. It can feel a little rudimentary, but is altogether a very refined and enthralling experience.\n\nThe oceans of Planet 4546B is inhabited by truly awe-inspiring and just all-around well-designed alien creatures. They feel so truly individualized, being so diverse not only by their visual design alone, but also just how they seamlessly contextually fit into this fantastic world.\nOnly topped by the gorgeous and diverse atmosphere, established with its fluent mixture of semi-earthly ideas but spun with an other-worldly and at times outlandish presentation to it all. The environments can feel completely alienating in late-game areas especially, which is an honest compliment.\nSerious praise to the developers behind the visual designs of this game. The whole world simply feels so alive and lived in.\n\nBut as aforementioned, the game isn't perfect, and most of my serious issues with the game lie within its many technical shortcomings.\nMainly resorting to the visual side, but nevertheless still real issues.\n[i]Textures can be really delayed when loading, objects are often slow to the party, LOD changing far too close, the occasional low-resolution texture, noticeable Z-fighting[/i]...\n...It can really deter from the otherwise amazing picture the game paints through its vistas.\nWhile it obviously becomes progressively easier to overlook the more you play, it altogether cannot be ignored and it never does disappear.\nIt's honestly such a bummer, since the game is so often just so close to looking so good.\nAdditionally, walking up slopes on dry land can be a little wonky, and I did accidentally fall through the floor once.\n\nWhile suffering from prevalent technical issues, it never stopped me from loving and adoring the game, and it certainly never deterred me from pushing onward.\nOverall, Subnautica is not only of the best games within its genre that I have ever played, but is also so far one of the best games that I have played this year.\nTherefore deservedly receiving a [u]strong recommendation[/u] from me!",

        "review": "[h1]Beware of the Depths[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]Graphics/Performance[/b]\r\n\r\nThis game is a bit dated, so it works flawlessly on 4K using an RTX 3090. Its cloud saves allowed me to play on my Linux machine, Steam Deck, and Windows when playing in VR. If configured well on the Steam Deck, you can get 4 hours of game time while sipping on 9-10 watts; such as lower resolution, 40 FPS limit, and low settings. The added VR support is very nice after you install the VR enhancements Mod from Nexus/GitHub by IWhoI. There aren't motion controls, but I've heard of a separate mod that's trying to add those in.\r\n\r\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\r\n\r\nWow, what can I say about this amazing experience? It starts you in such a nice relaxing reef, but things start to tug at you. Like that crashed ship in the distance or a cave that's full of resources. You slowly venture out of your comfort zone and tame the shallows, only for the depths to call out to you. The pacing of this game is perfect. You slowly unlock a tech tree that makes you feel more daring... until you meet a bigger fish. The base building is very modular but decent. Survival elements are what you'd expect, but with oxygen as an added factor.\r\n\r\n[b]Sound[/b]\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good but repetitive. You'll hear the same tunes many times over a playthrough. The sound effects are top-notch, from the pinging of the sonar to the sound of surfacing, and the greeting you receive as you enter a vehicle; all these really immerse you in this water world. The whale-like sounds of the larger creatures really unnerve you.\r\n\r\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\r\n\r\nI played this game a long time ago but never had the courage to leave the shallows. I shelved it and it sat in my backlog for years. The overly positive reviews from the community led me back to it as I was looking for the next backlog game to load up... I can't believe I slept on this one; it's easily the best open-world crafting survival game I've played with a dash of horror and anxiety. The story is subtle but slowly unfolds through exploration. The world-building, biomes, sea life, and technologies all fit so well. The added bonus of being able to play on the go via Steam Deck or boot up the game in VR using my gaming rig is the cherry on top of a great game. Standing on a cliff with nothing but darkness below and jumping is terrifying, especially in VR. Pushing ever so deeper to progress the story is such a high; sometimes I forget to breathe.\r\n\r\n2 fins up as I dive into the abyss.",

        "review": "Excellent survival crafting game with an intriguing story and fairly rich world to explore.\n\nThere's a lot of repetitive time consumption, though. I played in the default survival mode and I really can't understate how much having to manage food and water intake ate into my time. Although annoying, this does push you to plan your excursions more thoroughly and use items you might otherwise ignore (managing salt storage, utilizing grav traps to catch food, locker caches for food supplies).\n\nBuilding and maintaing your base feels rewarding as you progress through blueprint collection and begin to expand on your base, through necessity, quality of life improvements, or simple aesthetic constructs (furniture).\n\nI feel that the quest system could really use a little more handholding in the early stages; although you're pushed from location to location via radio signal checkpoints, I wish that the urgency to mark locations through beacons was impressed upon me sooner. Having tasks that explicitly require use of the Prawn Suit may have led me to trying to craft it earlier. Understanding the importance of the pathfinder tool sooner may have prevented a few accidental drownings before I began trying to find solutions. \n\nOften when you get stuck, the only solution provided is \"go deeper,\" but deeper where? Our player has all this technology at their fingertips, but doesn't have access to a basic map for explored locations and instead has to rely on a live topographical view of the immediate area? Maybe I should have drawn one on paper myself, but this felt like a huge oversight.\n\nAnd, although the crafting system feels well managed, it's difficult to prepare for additional stages of crafting without referring to the Fandom Wiki. Once you make your way deep enough to explore the lava caves, you really don't want to return there a dozen times because you didn't collect a few materials needed that you weren't aware of. Sure, this can be remedied by just hoarding mass quantities any time you make a run, but occasionally—oops, it turns out that a count of 10 just wasn't enough!\n\nDespite these quality of life complaints, Subnautica offers a well above average adventure. The tension you feel as you dive ever deeper into the abyss creates a sense of wonder, curiosity, and dread for what's lurking around the corner. The world around you feels alive and dangeous, and immensely rewarding to comb through. Having a definitive ending also allows the player to neatly wrap up their time on planet 4546B.\n\nHighly recommended.",

I had genuine shock scares at times when confronted with some of the large apex predators and my heartbeat would increase as I descended into dark murky biomes. Subnautica contains various different biomes at varied depths with often stunning visuals and a variety of unique and fantastical sea creatures. The story unfolded organically and was quite immersive as time went on, driving me literally deeper into this world. The crafting system was a lot of fun, and I often would spend hours gathering loads of crafting materials and building elaborate habitats. Subnautica has cemented itself as my favourite survival style games, as well as becoming one of my favourites of all time.",

I've played for so long yet i haven't completed the story yet. the one thing i would say though is be careful with the prawn suit as it can sometimes glitch through the floor when travelling. Other than that the game is beautiful and probably my favourite. A lot of youtubers say it's so scary, especially the reaper but i think it's not scary at all, it's just annoying being in your seamoth one moment and flying through the air the next.

Even though I can only play it on the lowest graphics level it’s still the best. I don’t know how to describe it but I’ll try. \n\nI just have an old Windows 10 computer with 8GB of RAM and that’s why I can only play this Game on the lowest graphic level. To be honest at first, I thought it’ll be just like those other games I’ve played... But when I started the game, I immediately noticed that the lowest graphics level here is like the middle of another game, and that's really impressive, I mean you can still see all details that need to be seen. And it runs quite smoothly too what I never thought it would...because my PC is just a Work PC after all...I don’t know how many people out there still use this kind of computer, but if there are some then I can assure you that you can still play this game, but only on the lowest graphic level... Unless you have installed a better graphics card. And the price-performance ratio of this game is top in my opinion. Other games in the same category require more money. \n\nI don't know if that kind of comment is appropriate these days with all the new technology... I don't think anyone needs a comment like that anymore... But if they do, I'm happy if it helped a little to ensure that Windows Ten runs pretty smoothly at this game. \n\nAnd I can assure you that I’m not an old one who says this. I’m just a minor after all... I have a hard time to find the right words to say, so please don't judge when this comment of mine doesn't help at all. And I'm not looking for pity either, I just want to help as best I can, even if it might not work.",

        "review": "although its no where in the categories, subnautica is by far one of the most stressful and scary games i've ever played yet it can also be relaxing and fun. from the safe shores all the way down to the lava zone there is something here for almost everyone. from searching for materials to building bases and vehicles to avoiding you're first leviathan, the magic of this game and the first play through is truly stunning. if for some reason you haven't bought this game, you're missing out on possibly one of the scariest and funnest open world adventure games of all time. We love you Unknown Worlds, and i'm sure i speak for all of us when saying \"we can't wait for Subnautica 2, but take as much time as you need, perfection cant be rushed\"",
