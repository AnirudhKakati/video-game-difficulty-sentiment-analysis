        "review": "(THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLY GOOD FIRST OF ALL IT'S GREAT IT'S REALLY FUN AND HARD)\n... However this PC version crashes all the damn time, making the DLC especially pretty much a huge pain to try to enjoy and complete. I wish I could go back to it, I had planned for a 100% playthrough going in, but it just sucks so much and it's so demoralizing to deal with the perpetual crashing constantly kicking you out of the groove of some amazing runs in this GREAT game that is FUN AS HELL when you can actually play it without interruption.\n\n(I FULLY RECOMMEND THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF THE GAME IT'S REALLY PEAK STUFF)\n\nPlay this on PS5 if you have one. I don't so I'm stuck with this. Shoulda gave it to Nixxes.",

Anyways, story is abstract at times, I tried to pay attention but gave up after a while. The bosses are really fun, though some of them are shockingly easy at times. Example, the final boss gave me no issues what so ever compared to minibosses or certain enemies. I enjoyed it. Excited to see what Housemarque does next!",

        "review": "This is probably the most underrated game ever how this did not win game of the year back in 2021 or receive any awards is hard to believe.... the gameplay and character movement is so smooth and the combat is so satisfying... Only other game that gave me this kind of experience is Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal... Graphics are good with a really great particle system. The narrative and story while seeming confused at first is actually executed brilliantly and makes a lot of sense once you get to the end of the game... This game gave me an experience that I will not forget for a very long time and nowadays there are very few games that do this for me. The PC port does have some small issues here and there like stuttering at times but there are mods to fix that and overall I had a good experience. Co-op feature is really good especially at the beginning when the game may feel very difficult but it can be hard to find people as many do not play on pc... Overall I would recommend this game if you like rougelite shooters and want a different and unique experience compared to most games out there.",

        "review": "Incredibly memorable and thought provoking, Returnal provides a unique and worthwhile experience. It is regrettably held back by its simplistic roguelike elements.\n\nWhen the best character upgrades are simple stat increases it robs the game of its complexity. With few exceptions, increasing Vitality and Damage is absolutely the best choice for your resources. I would have liked it if the upgrades in this game granted combat power to the player through effects which then resulted in more effective vitality or damage rather than immediately giving a percentage stat increase.  To illustrate this point further, in Risk of Rain 2, Ukulele isn't a good item because it just increases your damage. It's a good item because it also has a chance to create arcing chain lightning which can reactivate your other on-hit items. The same principle applies in Noita with Chainsaws allowing for wand wrapping. In Returnal an artifact that executes this principle well is the Resinous Shield which grants you a shield against the next hit when you pick up Resin. This is much more interesting than a damage/integrity/protection augment and I would have liked to have seen more items like this.\n\nI believe that the developers expected that having weapons with random traits would provide enough variety in conjunction with the malfunction and parasite systems but the latter are so often not worth engaging with due to their random negative effects. Debuffs such as \"suffer damage when collecting items\" or \"suffer damage on Overload\" are completely debilitating effects since they fight against muscle memory and in the case of the former, effectively halts item progression entirely until you can cleanse it.\n\nI would like to see a version of this game where weapon traits are collectables that can mix and match with all the base weapons. I also disliked the proficiency system as it encourages repeated use of the same weapon. Encouraging the player to use different weapons with a reward system such as in Hades would have helped alleviate stagnation. Perhaps increased experience gains for a certain amount of kills. Furthermore, A simple 1-2-3 melee combo would have done wonders to the game's flow. Add a weapon which expands the melee skill set too while we're at it.\n\nThe elite monsters are absolutely the most dangerous encounters in the game and a fair criticism of the encounter design is that the power budget for elites is too high and a portion should have been allocated elsewhere. Returnal largely becomes a game of surviving these elite encounters and is less engaging once you master its fundamentals.\n\nWhen all is said and done Returnal is still an amazing game and every video game enthusiast should try it. Something which can not be overstated is the incredible attention to detail. The lead up and conclusion to the fourth boss really was one of those once in a lifetime gaming experiences. It is burned into my soul.",

In particular is very stuttering even on a powerful PC (I have played the game on a 4090, a Ryzen 9 7900x, 32GB of DDR5 @6000MT and a 980 PRO NVMe SSD). I think the problem is the frame cap that doesn't work as it should. Turing off all the ray tracing effects and using the Vsync to avoid going over the 120Hz of my monitor solved the majority of the stutters, but some (traversal stutters) are still present. In 4k at 120fps this version was still a superior experience to the PS5's one and the stutters are not game breaking (at least at 120fps), but it's a shame that the game has this small \"stain\"",

The sound of rain in the dense forest rolling down my suits display as I search through cryptic log files for clues. Slowly walking through the cyclopean architecture as I listen to the mad ramblings of a Selene who came before, I prepare for the confrontations that await. The horror and panic as, out of the corner of my eye, I spot an Apollo Astronaut who shouldn't exist, watching me.\n\nOn offer is one of the purest escapes from our reality that I've ever experienced, but it comes at a cost. This game has imparted upon me a perpetual sense inescapable dread. By the end, the flow of my mind mirrored the cycle: endings, beginnings, all mixed into one endless undecipherable loop circulating through my head. Whereas for Selene, the cycle will stretch on into the starlit void of eternity, I will be set free from this madness at the end of my inconsequential lifetime, but until then, I will savour every moment that I've spent on Atropos.",

        "review": "[h1]One of the Best Rouguelites with AAA Quality[/h1]\r\n\r\n[h2]The Setup[/h2]\r\nWe play as Selene, an Astra Space Scout. Players instantly find themselves in a crash on to an unknown planet. Our job is to survive the fauna and dangers of the planet. It's not long before we realize that the planet holds more secrets about Selene than we imagined.\r\n\r\nThe game makes us go through multiple biomes with multiple arenas that holds multiple kinds of bosses and sub-bosses in store. If you die, you start from beginning but some items and upgrades remain across the runs. However, this changes once we reach halfway into the game.\r\nAll the arenas and level are procedurally generated and weapon and item drops are all random. Thgis may make getting all achievements a bit frustrating.\r\n\r\n[h2]The Gameplay[/h2]\r\nIt's a third person shooter where weapons and melee feels satisfying but the accuracy and feedback takes a back seat. This isn't a bad thing as killing the enemies is just a way for progression to next level and gun upgrades. The dopamine rush comes from the Adrenaline mechanic that reward players with instant boosts if we manage to kill multiple enemies without taking a hit.\r\nNot taking a hit rewards the players even more with the fact that with full health, all the health pickups (Silphiums) become Silphium Resins that contributes to increasing the health pool.\r\nThis is where my major gripe from the game comes from. Once you become accustomed with the gameplay mechanics and figure out how to become fat by optimizing health pickups, the game becomes a bit too easy. It feels like enemy levels don't react much to our health pools.\r\n[b]There's a sure shot way to make this game easy: Grow health pool and just explore each an every corner of every room in each run![/b]\r\nHaving said that, I had a lot of fun playing the game and one of the bosses actually tested my skills where I defeated it with a sliver of health left.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of platforming thrown in as well where every biome will have some items locked for traversal that can be unlocked by the items we receive by progressing into the game.\r\n[b]If you can't reach any item in any arena, just remember that the game is designed to make you play again and you may reach that item in next run with permanent item unlocks earned via story progression[/b]\r\n\r\n[h2]The Visuals[/h2]\r\nThe game looks and runs amazing on mid to high-end builds. It supports Ultrawide and DLSS as well as Frame Generation for RTX 40 Series and above cards. The art of this game is inspired by a lot of space and sci-fi media and they've done a good job of creating a game the looks and feels fabulous. There are a few stutters here and there but mostly it's a solid PC port of a visually stunning PS5 game.\r\n\r\n[h2]The Story[/h2]\r\nI particularly loved the story presented in a non-chronological and psychological horror style. The story would appear a pretty basic distress and escape run but the distress runs too deep once you progress further into the house cutscenes. These segments may appear all confusing at first but once you understand it by piecing together all the various logs and cryptic scriptures in the game, it becomes clear that it about deep traumatic experiences and guilt.\r\nThere are two endings of the game: one is a basic ending that brings more questions than it answers and then there's a true ending that can only be achieved my making minimum two full runs of the game by watching all house cutscenes, collecting a few separate items and killing the final boss again.\r\nEven after achieving this true ending, if you have questions like I had, just open any story explainer on the internet and it will become crystal clear.\r\n\r\n[h2]My Rating[/h2]\r\n[b]9/10\r\nThis is truly an underrrated gem from Housemarque that got put away by a lot of people intimidated by its initial difficulty and confusing story presentation. But those who stick by and take effort to understand every aspect of the game and the story, are rewarded by an unforgettable experience. it's most definitely a MUST PLAY[/b]",

There are also hints at certain things that actually never come, like [spoiler]the fact you might encounter another version of yourself that's hostile.[/spoiler]\n\nThe gameplay is alright though. The further you go, the better your equipment and weapons. With the right equipment, you can actually have about 3 lifes at a time, so it's very doable. I'd say the biggest problem is that because it's a rogue elite, a run can be heavily unbalanced against or in your favour, and you HAVE to die to get all the collectibles.",

You have to think about the budget and compare it to AAA games. So don't expect any extraordinary gameplay or plot twists which will blow your mind. The game runs smooth without any lag.\n\nIt's solid for casual players but I wouldn't recommend it to pro gamers. Very repetitive and no real progress. Hades was also very repetitive but there was much more variety. \n\nA big no-no is the ugly protagonist which was definitely chosen and designed to BE ugly. It's a mindboggling trend in the gaming industry which has infested the western studios, not so much the far eastern studios. What's wrong with a beautiful female protagonist? Never got this. At least make a her look badass but NOT masculine. After all you sell this game to men for the most part. Your target audience shouldn't be game journalists or reddit bloggers.",

Game is installed on a SSD (as recommended).\r\n\r\nI have tried everything that people discuss about the crashes online:\r\n- Disabling Steam Overlay\r\n- Disabling Steam Controls\r\n- Using DX11 Mode\r\n\r\nI tried in 4K with DLSS, without DLSS, with Resolution scaled down with HDR on, with HDR off.\r\nI tried 1440p with DLSS, without DLSS.\r\nI even downgraded the graphics driver.\r\nI also tried with a Radeon RX580 (8GB) in the same system.\r\n\r\nTHE GAME KEEPS CRASHING!\r\nIt crashes in irregular intervals. Sometimes it's fine for an extend time, than it crashes every 15 minutes.\r\nOther bugs that keep appearing are:\r\n- Audio bugs\r\n- Texture loading bug\r\n- Game briefly minimizing and reappearing paused (without crash)\r\n\r\nThe crashes happen during boss fights, involved story sequences and during mundane gameplay (no enemies in the room, just browsing for items).\r\n\r\nIt is really sad, because the game is really great. The rougelike gameplay is great. The Combat is awesome. The presentation is great, even on low/mid settings. But the crashes are so bad that it kills all fun and immersion. It's really that frustrating when the game crashes on an intense boss fight, that just had you on the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nThe issues will probably not be addressed by the publisher. Since Sony Interactive Entertainment sees its PC releases as an advertisement for people buying PS5 Consoles, PS5 Controllers and signing up for their Playstation network.\r\n\r\nReally really sad.\r\nBut I can not recommend playing this version unless the \"fatl error\" crashes are fixed. Which does not seem very likely.",

        "review": "Returnal is a must go if you like Rouge-lite games, it has a very good gameplay and it becomes more rewarding as you advance through each of the levels. The game highly rewards skills, so it encourages you to master-it. However there are something you must know before you enter this game, being a Playstation AAA comes with it's downfalls and Returnal does not escape this. \r\n\r\nThe first and most important it's the length of each run, as I told before this is a rouge-lite game, however that doesn't mean (in this case) that is a short game. Each run is pretty long if you ask me taking about 1-2 hours (or more) to complete one cycle, this can be exhausting at most times and frustrating if you are killed in a advanced zone so be prepared for that, you can also pause the game and return but we both know that when you're in the zone this will not be your first choice. I think the fact that is a AAA makes it be longer and that enters in conflict with the type of game that it is (for me it should have short but addictive runs).\r\n\r\nThe game fails in giving a proper level-up if you one to skip early zones, you would find that doing a complete run will alwayd give you more level/resources/upgrades than not doing one and the game doesn't even try to compensate a little (so you don't have to do the first level over and over again), it just gives you a weapon scaling and that's it there is no health, perks, consumables or resources scaling which makes complete runs mandatory in order to be prepared enough (it's not necessary to do all the zones of the run but at least one).  Also it the game can be a little dumb at the time of giving you upgrades, this are supposed to be random (which is greate is part of a rouge-lite experience) but for example there is a resource that is used to increase the level of your weapon, I was in the last zone already preparing for the final boss and I used the last of one of the resources (keys, which you use to open great value chest) and it gave me a material to increase my weapon level WHEN IT WAS ALREADY AT THE MAX LEVEL -.- so I literally throwed to the garbage that key, I'm not saying I should always be given what I want but the game could be a little more intelligent it that sense and take out of it's random roulette that type of item.\r\n\r\nIt's final weak point is it's re-playability, in most games I enjoy collecting all the secrets of a game as long as I can do it in a very organic way by just playing and having fun with the game, however due to the randomness of this type of games, it can turn tedious to do it because you can do 5 runs doing all the rooms of a level and that one recording that you need to complete all the recordings of the level will not appear, so be careful if you want to obtain all collectibles. Also it's perks - downgrade system (called Parasites) is not as well done as I would like, something having great-pearks at very low cost or having horrible downgrades for mostly nothing but that clearly depends on the player.\r\n\r\nI know that I talked a lot about it's weakpoints but as I am already recommending this game I prefer to talk about that, being that said, Returnal is a fantastic game, it's game mechanics are extremely fun to master and very rewarding, for me the enemies are very different from level to level despite people saying otherwise (it's true it recycles somethings but for me it isn't thaaaat of a copy). THE BOSSES ARE VERY GOOD, really if you like bullet-hells this a very nice 3D attempt, it's environment and world building is pretty solid to me is not fascinating but it gets the job done, also it has very good sound effects that are pretty immersive. A must-go if you like challenges and as I said before rouge-lite experiences.",

Overall balance is not very good. The gameplay does not have enough variability.  Optimal play requires too much backtracking. The game is too long for its contents. Even though I beat the certain bosses at the first try, it felt too long.\n\nThe story starts somewhat interesting but becomes uninteresting eventually. The story looks like sci-fi on the surface, but actually it is that of [spoiler]a horror game.[/spoiler] Another point is that the storytelling is not appropriate for a game with this long playtime. The game never explain the story clearly and leave it to a guess. Constantly watching that kind of storytelling over extended period of time feels really tedious. Moreover, there are [spoiler]a normal ending and a secret ending. After getting the normal ending, I lost my patience and watched the secret ending on YouTube. They did not feel sufficiently meaningful to justify neither tedious storytelling nor long playtime.[/spoiler]\n\nAdditionally, the game have memory leaks and requires restart every couple hours. (I would still advise not to play this game even if the memory leaks were fixed.)",

Get Risk of Rain 2 or Witchfire instead.  This one only got praise because of the Sony name.\n\nEdit: played more, finished the game, did some of the Tower mode, my opinion is more solidified.  The adrenaline mechanic just encourages restarting the game for early game mistakes, there's not enough zone or enemy variety, half the weapons are awful to use, there's just not enough here.  The gunplay and movement stuff all works a lot of the time but it's not enough to make up for the rest of the game.  ",

(not that I judge anyone for enjoying it!)\r\n\r\nConsidering that I only heard praise for this game and the combination of a roguelike with bullet hell elements sounded like a match made in heaven, I had very high expectations.\r\nHowever, I was left extremely underwhelmed by this title.\r\n\r\nWhile the game- and gunplay is quite fluid, fastpaced and fun, the roguelike elements are genuinely terrible.\r\nThere's only a handful of weapons to choose from, many of which don't even feel that special or unique from one another.\r\nSo you already have a small base-set of weapons to vary gameplay between runs, but the items you can find - which should be the lifeblood of any good roguelike - are super boring too!\r\n\r\nIt feels like 99% of items are just variations of \"increase damage by 10%\", \"increase damage by x% if you can maintain your adrenaline buff\", \"increase max HP%\", \"increase damage reduction\", \"get lifesteal\".\r\nCongratulations, you've now witnessed the vast majority of upgrades you can find in Returnal.\r\n\r\nThis means that every single run feels exactly like the last one, because no item in any way seems to actually affect *how* you play, it's all just stat increases!\r\n\r\nNow add on top, that a \"run\" will last 2-3 hours (!!!) and always features the same half dozen or so bosses, you can imagine there's little to motivate me to come back to playing this ever again after rolling credits.\r\n\r\nI'm frankly just happy I managed to beat the game with just 3 deaths and 7 hours of playtime, because I don't think I would've enjoyed having to redo up to 3 hours of lost progress if I had died in the last biome.\r\n\r\nReturnal, at it's base is a decent game in terms of gameplay, but in my opinion the roguelike elements add absolutely nothing to it and it would have benefinited much more from being a simple linear game instead.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to enjoy this all the way back since I've heard people talking about it when it released on PS5.\r\nBut for the life of me I can't see how this game is getting so much praise.",

Every enemy looks the same, items use the same colors for multiple different types of items. I can't tell when I am about to pick up a health upgrade or a healing item because they are both green blobs on the floor. I can't tell if the item is cursed or if it is one of the permanent currency items because both of them are purple blobs on the floor.\n\nI can't tell if the enemy I am about to face is going to create a red circle, or shoot rapid fire following shots, or a shotgun burst of shots because all of the enemies look like tentacle creatures.\n\nThey need to sort out the colors and silhouettes of enemies so the game is more readable. THAT is the only thing holding this game back.\n\nYou may still have fun with this game, it is well made otherwise, but it is a terrible loss for what comes down to a failure of art direction.",

I'm not even a big shooter fan, i play this and the Borderlands franchise in that genre.\n\nThe gameplay is top notch. You can feel the weight of your character but never have the impression you're maneuvering a truck. The controls are very snappy and precise. When you die, it's to be put on you on and almost never on the game. It's hard, i won't say it's not, but it's fair. I never had the feeling the game was going out of its way to kill me, unlike the Souls games sometimes do (with debatable tactics like delayed attacks and such). Returnal is not 'viciously' hard and i rarely felt frustrated when i had to start over again.\n\nIf you enjoy sci-fi and weird atmospheres, there are good chances you will like this. The story is interesting but pretty cryptic, everyone will have their own interpretation of it i guess, it leaves a good amount to the player imagination.\n\nTechnically speaking it's pretty good, i play in 4K 60 FPS and didn't notice any major stuttering. In a sense it was to be expected as the game on PS5 was flawless in that department. Not sure in what state it was when it first released on PC, but now it's quite good.",

The gameplay feels awesome and unlocking new abilities opens up the game a lot. However I completed my first playthrough after around 13 hours which isn´t that much considering I took my time. While the game offers multiple endings and some more items I can unlock I can´t really see myself going through multiple runs.\r\n\r\nItemisation in this game is really really boring and lackluster. While the weapons you use are kind of interesting the artefacts that you collect each run and the consumable items are so irrelevant and boring for me. I really wish they added a few more interesting options which can actually alter the way how you run the levels. \r\n\r\nIf you can get it in a sale like I did it is worth the money and time and I had a blast considering I really wish the game would offer more content to explore or at least options how to make multiple playthroughs more interesting.",

        "review": "One of the most addictive games I've played in a long time. Really pretty looking, runs super well, and the gameplay is SMOOTH. I also really am enjoying the story. It's a very ambitious game, and I think it does everything well. The story sequences are especially polished and feel straight out of the newer Resident Evil games.\n\nThe main (non Tower of Sisyphus) 'runs' do get pretty long, making it not feel so much like a rogue-like to me, more of a mix between linear game + rogue-like. It took my 5 hours to get through biomes 1-3. That's long! Compare that to other rouge-likes like Binding of Isaac where the runs are typically much shorter (and frequent). It definitely IS a rogue-like though, it just feels very different from other games I've played where in a play session you'll do multiple runs. With Returnal, I found each run to be way longer.\n\nHowever, the Tower of Sisyphus runs are a nice diversion from the main runs. They are faster paced and just focused on combat. No running around big maps, looking for secrets. These runs are more like Binding of Isaac and they offer their own scoring system.\n\nI'm in shock at how polished this game is! It is just plain fun.",

This had me bustin' outta areas I hadn't since I first played Hades.\r\n\r\nYou're immediately dropped in and can play the game you bought. You can run fast and dash as soon as you start. Everything about the movement and combat is so satisfying. And movement is perfect on k&m, no need for controller unless you prefer it. You are never prevented from playing--the story is purely optional and never forces you to sit idly while expositional cutscenes take place. The momentum is absolutely flawless.",

It gives me the movement I have always wanted for a roguelike its as if a year went into JUST perfecting the movement system alone the game is gorgeous, fluid, fun, fast and the items are wonderful. There are items you can get that give you a benefit and a flaw, it makes you think and work around what would be a good build for you. If you like roguelikes I highly highly recommend, I had this on ps5 and STILL bought it for PC please give this game an honest try they should have marketed it more as everyone else should play it.",

        "review": "\"Frustrating, Buggy, and Held Together by Gaps and Glitches\"\n\nI wanted to like this game, but it’s a frustrating mess. The combat, reliant on a Gears of War-style active reload system, should have been satisfying—if it weren’t for the clunky, unreliable timing that drains any potential enjoyment. Pair that with a grappling hook that doesn’t even function in the first two biomes, and you’re left with a combat experience that feels broken right from the start.\n\nThe game’s core loop is uninspired, featuring bullet-hell patterns and floating platform mechanics that feel recycled from countless other titles (think NieR or Drakengard). It’s as though an indie developer pieced it together in a few hours using asset store assets—lacking creativity or any real innovation.\n\nBut what’s worse is the storytelling. It’s an attempt at being symbolic and melancholy, but instead comes off as inconsistent, poorly delivered, and unnecessarily depressing. The narrative leaves so many gaps, seemingly in an effort to make players fill them in with their imagination. What could’ve been a compelling story ends up disjointed and incoherent, feeling like a patchwork of ideas that never fully connect.\n\nAnd the bugs? They’re rampant. During the Helio's home sequence, I encountered a game-breaking glitch where the stairs soft-locked me on the second floor, causing me to lose progress and artifacts. Worse still, I couldn’t even save my cycle during the story sequence. For a game with an always-online design, it’s unacceptable for it to be so unstable.\n\nIn the end, this game feels like a joyless grind—a frustrating mix of poor mechanics, incoherent storytelling, and constant bugs. Even at 75% off, it’s hard to recommend spending money on what feels like an incomplete and broken experience.",

But if you want to get better guns you need to run through the stages and room to level up your Gun drops. There are also some artifacts that you can get that will help. Of course you could just plow right through if you are good enough, it IS a bullet hell like game so most stuff can be dodged with game knowledge. The bosses are fun and I enjoy the game play loop.

But - for this reviewer at least - Returnal offers just that. It is not any of its parts that make this such an immersive, novel, and satisfying title. It is the organic whole that blends the gameplay, storyline, and audiovisual elements together to give us something that almost feels alive. As for the difficulty level that many reviewers comment on, I personally find it just right for a formerly invested and currently very casual gamer. I use mouse and keyboard and have felt no need to switch to my gamepad. It is, I suppose, a matter of taste. But like everything else in this game, the difficulty and respawn cycle are intimately connected to the story line. Just sit back and cherish the ride.",

If only big studios invested in smooth stylized art like DRG/Dota/Risk of Rain instead of \"Realistic\" graphics that require upscaling and frame generation to run on average hardware. Edit: I'd be tempted to buy this and try it again with lossless scaling (on steam) if I could even hit 30.

        "review": "I'm someone who doesn't buy many AAA games on Steam anymore. I know it's a personal thing, but many modern big budget games feel like they hold you hand a bit too hard to appeal to a wider audience. This game, however, does not feel like that to me, and I respect it immensely for that. This is a super hard yet rewarding rogue-like with an intriguing story and amazing visuals, and it may surprise you at many turns with how things shake up. Despite all my praise, there is one thing I do dislike, and it's something many people bring up. This game is very poorly optimized for PC. The game looks amazing, but that doesn't come with unstable framerates and occasional stuttering. I know it isn't just my PC either, because these problems persist whether I have it on the lowest settings or the highest ones. So, if unstable framerates are something that bother you, you may want to skip out on this otherwise amazing game.",

        "review": "Gorgeous god-Tier Gaming experience.  From gameplay and reincarnation mechanics to storytelling and design, Returnal did not disappoint, in fact, it excelled.   Loads of fun and loads of replay value (which is really what its all about with roguelikes at the end of the day - is it not?).  In an era where are there are so many beautiful games with compelling stories it can difficult to stand out in a memorable way like the games of yore but Returnal does exactly that.\n\nThere were major aspects of the story which were shocking and somewhat disappointing at first but I've grown to appreciate these narrative choices and the fact that they differentiate this tale from the typical sci-fi romp. I had fun with it and i think that folks to enjoy a bit of narrative depth, psychological horror, breathtaking graphics, and adrenaline-pumping battles will have fun with it too.  \n\nbe advised: make sure that you have the hardware to run this game smoothly (regardless of graphic settings) as it deserves at least that.  Furthermore, i was initially prompted with a warning stating that my hardware was incapable of playing the game and thus i closed the game and ordered the parts to upgraded said hardware.  However, as i was waiting for the new GPU to arrive, I realized that i could simply close the warning and play the game despite it (no fancy bypass or know-how required. i simply closed-exited the warning prompt).  That being said, my PC was running at relatively high temperatures whilst running the game smoothly on low-mid hardware settings.  After the hardware update, i no longer experienced the warning prompt or temp issues. points being, 1. make sure that your PC can run the game before you buy it 2. the warning prompt regarding hardware requirements not being met does not necessarily mean you will not be able to play the game",

        "review": "This game is amazing.\r\n\r\nIt presents a lot of systems and mechanics to challenge me, keep me on my toes, and incentivize trying new things. There's not a reroll system, which I thought was a bad thing at first, but have come around to it - The real reason there being no re-roll system is OK in this game is because it's very well balanced. There are for sure spikes of difficulty at times, but a re-roll system doesn't FEEL necessary, whereas it does feel necessary in many other games I've played. The lack of needing and having a re-roll system keeps the runs fresh and new - you're not able to re-roll for some effect, what you see is what you get - and it really embraces the ideas of roguelite games. \r\n\r\nSo far, after 26 hours of gameplay, the only issue(s) I have encountered have been texture downgrading after the game has been running for an extended period of time, and the game run requirements being extremely high. On the plus side, for the first issue you can 'pause' your run, so relaunching the game is a viable option which addresses the issue. For the second issue, there's really no fix, you just need the hardware. This, unfortunately, means that the game isn't viable for the Steam Deck. \r\n\r\nThe game has a non-linear method of storytelling, and it gives you little bits here and there and has really drawn me in. \r\n\r\nThis game actually plays like what \"AAA\" games are said to be but often are not - fully featured games with fun gameplay and well thought out design. Everything really came together for this game, and it's top notch. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: As long as you meet the hardware requirements (which are quite high compared to most games), and you like roguelites give this game a go. It's an awesome experience, and I'm not one to rate games as highly as I rate this one.",

I'm not 100% on the former, but I've definitely experienced way too much stutter.  On a VRR OLED, the flickering gets really bad too, so bear that in mind.  Also, don't play with ray tracing.  RT isn't properly optimized, and some late-game areas will absolutely tank your framerate due to horrible CPU under utilization not unlike what is seen in Jedi: Survivor and Ghostrunner 2.  Your mileage may vary depending on how willing you are to put up with these issues, I found it exhausting but it didn't ruin my experience.\n\nThat being said, Returnal is hands down my favorite PlayStation-published game I have played since Bloodborne.  It the most brutally punishing video game I have played in my life, but it is home to some of the best combat scenarios, levels, and bosses I have ever encountered.  When the game hits, it hits hard.  It also makes great use of the DualSense controller, though it needs to be plugged in for the haptic feedback and triggers to work.  I really love this game so much, and thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for an ultra challenging bullet hell and/or roguelike experience.",

But it´s just the right amount of rogue-like to always gain at least something worthwhile during any run.",

        "review": "I kiiind of wish i returned it... it does have a ton of things that i love, but all built on a rogue-like system, which for games made in a few weeks its understandable, but they literally killed their own game with that decision, if properly managed, it could have been easily a nowadays Metroid (i say that as a big fan of it)\n\nBasically, the game feels like you actually started playing a dlc-rogue-like of the actual game where you kind of get to re-live the game that you should have played in a proper order, is it worth it? as it is right now exclusively in a discount, not escessively big tho.\n\nMechanics? 3rd person shooter in a bullet \"\"\"hell\"\"\" in 3D, nothing bad there, except for the fact that all the game's tempo is absurdly and unnecesary frantic, it is just completely excessive, specially because they try to tell you a story, that imo is quite worth it, and they really worked for a lot of that, but every time you stop for a... im gonna call it cut scenes (they are not exactly that but...) to avoid spoilers... it makes it come to a halt, veeery sudden most times.\n\nThe fact that the game instead of a lame effort on extending the playable hours of the game, trying to bait ppl in cuz rogue-like popularity of games this years went higher than it should have, being based on replaying over and over the same thing with a \"different map\" while barely advancing in the story, and the only mean on actually advancing... is \nSPOILER - - - > dying... over and over, it just gets extremely boring and meaningless.\n\nThe main character quite captured what Metroid was to many of us (not literally in this game tho), a legendary bounty hunter (\"not very fun fact but...\" in the years it was developed it was a \"hidden fact\" in some countries that it was a woman, so hell yeah, an almost consumed fighter there that didnt need anything but a new objective and nothing could stop her! that was literally why i bought the game... it was like i saw her) Once again, not the same but u sure get some of those vibes the more u get to know Selene, the voice acting, behaviour in general... which i really liked most of the time, the character felt... kind of original and... honestly just in case u play the game or watch it, for me she was the best part of the game by far. wow with the \"cutscenes\"... just loved those.\n \nThere are literally 4 things that would make this game one of the best i played in years, the game style, as i said, not a lame effort on selling through a genre of games like rogue-like that die incredibly fast, but how about making a... yes literally Metroid but with this background, character, and awesome design? it would have been astonishing, and again, not absurdly fast paced...\n\nKeeping the equipment? ever heared of upgrades for \" YOUR CURRENT WEAPONS?\" i get it, the idea in this game goes... in a different way, and sadly+mostly cuz of making it rogue-like... but still! at least make it an option, it just get tedious and repetitive as hell.\n\nThe map, SUCH an AWESOME designs they have, but they screwed up like the devs from Remnant (Other stuff that i love, but precisely this part sucks) again adding more \"forced replayability\", would have been infinitely better if you just made a map, big as it could have been and super awesome for what i saw they can do, and that you can actually enjoy.\n\nThe storyline, since it depends on spawn and... dying...  it gets 4kd up because of the same i mentioned before, imagine that you actually get to see the story of a game since u start playing it to the moment you see the \"credits\"? i have to say, its cool that when you die in game, you see a cinematic slightly changed, depending on where u reached and what u got to know, that is very cool, but not worth the rest of the game!\n\nI wish they put some thought into it and made a decent story mode, and leave this... messs.... as an extra gamemode, i didnt play it online, but while you play u find some \"holograms\" of \"other players\" and when you finish watching them something comes and tries to... sure as hell not invite you to dinner xD\n\nReally wanted to like it, watch a summarized version of it somewhere at least, that sure is worth it, but they... sadly messed up :C",

The fact that the map is different every time you play, or even die, lends to the re-playability and greatly reduces the monotony. The weapon system is fun to level up and the upgrades actually feel useful. The Tower of Sisyphus is what I keep coming back to over a year later. The campaign was fun and compelling, but the tower is very challenging and I still play trying to improve my score. I keep looking for any other games like Returnal, and I can't find any. Doom Eternal is close, but Returnal is it's own thing. I hope a Returnal 2 is developed.",

The game looks amazing too, and its fairly polished although I did have one or two minor issues.\n\nThe story is very interesting as well. It is very, very layered and metaphorical it requires a lot of piecing things together yourself and it is quite ambiguous, but it's all done through audio logs and scripted sections so you won't need to comb through text to get the idea anD you can look as deeply into it as you want, or just take it (mostly) on face value.\n\nThe sound design is absolutely crazy as well, Hunt showdown level surround sound so use a good headset.",

High production values and mostly tight gameplay is pretty satisfying. I think the \"runs\" are a little long with a decent run taking 45-75 minutes and, especially in the beginning, you can feel like there is not a lot to show from it. But if you stick with it, the gameplay and weapon/enemy variety are interesting enough to make doing a run worthwhile. It's not a \"one more run\" type game because each one can be so long. It can also feel repetitive in one session to play longer than 1-2 hours. But it's something I keep coming back to for a quick fix. I don't think it will be a classic I'll play for years but for now  but it's a solid 7-8/10 for me. Easily worth a try at a discount.",

Ambience and OST is good the whole way through especially if you have a headset to compliment and take Advantage of the 3D audio options they have.\nBoss Visuals and Fights are Fun. 2nd Boss for me is the Best. Personal Preference.\n\nOverall if you love Roguelikes then you will love this game.",

There's a lot of good choices about the game play, the mechanics feel great, unfortunately the content is lacking. The story is unnecessary, it feels slapped on to justify the rogue-like setting, but it's too heavy handed with annoying scenes that feel like Myst instead of a shooter. Roughly 15 hours in and I'm tired of the small set of weapons, the upgrades for them don't add much variety, but more importantly the enemies are so forgettable, generic, and repetitive I've lost interest in finishing the game.",

Apparently been an issue since day one, and Sony can't be bothered to fix it.\n\nOther that, incredible gameplay and story. If it's 50% off at least then go for it, but my review stays negative until they fix the above (they won't).",

Due to the rouge-like nature, one moment you are obliterating everything in your path, and the next you just walked into an ambush and got absolutely pounded to dust by groups of over-powered enemies.  \n\nThe control is very well done, movements are responsive, firearms are varied and enjoyable to use.  However the RNG is kind all over the place, the difficulty spike can be very sudden and unforgiving, and that's what kept this game from reaching Hades' level of enjoyment.\n\nThe overworld is a chore to get through, however he boss fights are some of the most enjoyable moments in the game.  Each boss all have their own bullet hell patterns, which are beautiful and deadly at the same time, once you memorised their patterns it will be easy to beat all of them.  \n\nThe game can be brutal at times, but it also rewards patience and exploration, don't be afraid to sidetrack, you might just find something useful to help you live and fight another day.",

I am so happy with the face that this game FINALLY delivers on a promise do many other companies fail on. That is to make a procedurally generated world feel like you're actually exploring something. The graphics are A-1, top-notch so exciting and detailed that alone is a great boon. But the gameplay, especially the controls, are as far as I can tell, perfect in every way. Once you finally get over the learning curve (it was 2+ hours for me) the action in the fights was so addictive and intuitive it just was so gratifying! The game makes you WORK for your progress, but man does it reward you for the same.  \r\nHahaha as for the punishments?\r\n\r\nWell- sometimes life ain't fair.\r\n",

        "review": "[h2] Returnal[/h2]\n\nI definitely enjoyed it - the game turned out to be a mix of Remnant and Risk of Rain, which is a definite plus since I liked both projects. I also appreciated Sony's approach. They managed to create a very dynamic roguelike with satisfying impact and shooting mechanics, incredibly beautiful visuals, and they added a cinematic approach to the storyline, which includes elements of mystery, drama, and horror.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3282463806\nReturnal is a roguelike for the wealthy. I think the pricing policy became a barrier to the game's popularity, because for most people, roguelikes are typically in the mid-low price segment. But here, Sony suddenly makes an almost AAA game that no one asked for. However, given the costs, it's impossible to sell such a game at the same price level as other roguelikes, so it was a risk, and it's still unclear if it paid off.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3288343674\nDuring the full playthrough, there were a few unpleasant bugs, like a camera glitch after teleporting, or instances where the teleport itself wouldn't open. But overall, these bugs didn't affect my impression of the game. The game isn't very long; at various stages, it seems like you're reaching the end, but then it turns out there's more to go, requiring you to gather your strength and keep going. The difficulty level is moderately challenging, as you would expect from a roguelike, so you will have to die one way or another. The bosses are also relatively challenging (relative to the Elden Ring DLC, hehe), but overall, the game makes you sweat.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3285666368\nIn the end, I recommend trying this product, but it might be worth waiting for a discount. It's a high-quality and interesting cooperative experience with a friend. I'm not sure if it would have been better if the co-op supported more than two players, but I think having up to three players might have been optimal.",

It's such a good game on so many levels.\n\nI have both the PC and PS5 versions, and the PC version works great using a 4060ti and a 12900k.",

        "review": "I have the impression that the developer tried to make Space Hades in 3D but completely failed to understand what made Hades fun.\n\nHades offers a ton of variety and choices before and during every run. Hades offers you several very diverse weapons and allows you to tweak how those work by letting you choose between several interesting upgrades. \n\nIn Returnal you don't really have any choices or any way to tweak the playstyle to you your preference. Upgrades basically just give you a stat boost and do not change the way you need to play and every weapon drop you'll just compare the damage numbers of the weapon in order to decide if you want to pick it up or not. \n\nEssentially, death after death you grind you way back to the next Boss fight until you learned the pattern of the Boss and then you move on to the next Boss. Imagine playing the darksouls 1 Bosses who did not had a bone fire right before the fog wall. It's like that but the walk to the Boss is way longer and you need to grind for weapons and upgrades before you can go back to the Boss.\n\nIt does not help that the game has some annoying technical issues. There soft locks which can cost you a run and for some reason the frame rate can drop below 20fps during Bosses even besides running on a solid 60FPS the entire time before the encounter. Let me tell you that's not a fun way to die against a Boss.\n\nOh and gyro aiming would have been grate, dunno why so many Playstation games refuse to give you this option, ti's a shame",

        "review": "This game is beyond boring. The regular enemies and traversal of the procedurally generated biomes is way too easy. Bosses, on the other hand, take 25-33% of your health with every hit, meaning you can survive at best 3 or 4 hits. Bosses are also an hour away for each attempt. So the game loop is to slog through the biome, to attempt the visual cluttered mess that are boss fights. The first two bosses have taken me 3 tries each to kill. One try per phase, where the visual clutter just gets worse.\n\nI thought this would be ok because I heard the story was this amazing work of art. There is no story. It's awful so far. Nothing about it is captivating or interesting. It's just a generic groundhog day in space. But by far, the dumbest design decision the developers made was the healing mechanics. In most roguelikes you get a set number of heals with predictable refills. Healing in this game is backtracking 8 rooms to find the little green plus sign (+) on the map only for it to not be a heal but component to upgrade your max health.\n\nThis entire game is probably 10 hours worth of content stretched to 40-50 hours by horrible and boring design choices. I am bored out of my mind and uninstalling. Everything in between the bosses is worthless anyways, so might as well delete it. This game would have been 1000x better if it was just a boss rush game like Furi.",

They had some unique ideas, like monsters similar to games like Prey (the newer one), looping as in Edge of Tomorrow, mental issues made manifest in movies such as The Babadook or games such as Hellblade: Senuas Sacrifice. The gameplay is pretty unique too, a weird mix of 3rd person over-shoulder shooter meets bullet hell meets rogue like dungeon crawler.\r\nBut the game feels frustrating, unpolished, grindy, is 2x as long as it needs to be, stops being fun in 1/4 of that time AND it's already over after only 14 hours despite all the grindiness they designed. And they want 60$ for this without a sale? Are they fucking out of their minds? This game is worth 20-30$, tops. It neither has the well polished gameplay that addicting roguelikes such as Hades or Dead Cells have, nor the impressive action, motion capture, and interesting characters and story that great tripple A games from Naughty Dog like Last of Us, Uncharted 4 or God of War have. This game is pretentious and greedy and it pisses me the fuck off.\r\n\r\nPro:\r\n-unique monster design and setting \r\n-unique gameplay idea combining 3rd person shooter, bullethell and roguelike\r\n\r\n-Con:\r\n-too expensive for what it is\r\n-too grindy, and yet still too short. takes a special kind of incompetence to make a game feel too grindy and have it end after just 14 hours\r\n-bad difficulty. early on too hard and RNG reliant, but in a good run with good RNG too easy. I oneshot the final boss and didnt even lose more than 25% of my max HP. meanwhile I died probably 10-15 times just to get this one good run. frustrating, unfun\r\n-3rd person shoulder view sux for this kind of game. you need to be able to clearly see all the projectiles, enemy positions, ledges you can fall off etc. feels frustrating as fuck to play with this shitty perspective\r\n-too few good roguelike features that the competition such as Dead Cells already had. not enough reroll options to lessen the impact of RNG, no guaranteed weapon etc drops at the start of certain zones, etc etc. you mostly just have to keep dying until you get the good run\r\n-shit story & story telling. 90% is unsatisfying, mysterious and vague lazy ass story telling at the side, then at the end its suddenly like \"oh it was all in her head\". fuck that. writers should never have a job in the industry again. with great movies such as The Babadook that pulled this off perfectly theres no excuse to deliver this underwhelming story",

        "review": "Returnal peca mayormente de dos cosas: es corto y tiene muy pocos incentivos para ser rejugado más allá de sacar el final verdadero o todos los logros. Personalmente también lo he encontrado fácil pero entiendo que eso es ya una cuestión de cada uno (fácil para mí puede ser difícil para otro).\r\n[b]Artísticamente[/b] es una pasada. El sonido te pone los pelos de punta en ocasiones y los enemigos, sin haber una gran variedad de ellos, cumplen bastante bien. Me habría gustado un poquito más de variedad en los biomas aunque no están nada mal. Los jefes finales son una pasada.\r\nLa [b]historia[/b] no es que destaque precisamente. Es sencilla y sirve de excusa para que te pongas al teclado y ratón a matar bichos. Aún así he de decir que, aunque la historia de Selene no me interesó lo más mínimo, la del planeta Átropos y de la civilización xeno me ha dejado con muchas ganas de más.\r\nEn tema [b]controles[/b] el juego funciona a la perfección tanto con mando como con teclado y ratón. El movimiento es preciso, rápido y fluido, al igual que el gunplay.\r\nEn definitiva, recomiendo Returnal a todos los que seáis fans de este género. Más allá de sus defectos es muy divertido, y en este tipo de juegos creo que eso es lo más importante. Eso sí, nunca pagaría precio completo por él y me esperaría a alguna oferta. En mi opinión es el típico juego que debería haber salido a precio reducido.",

I dont recommend it.\nBetween one of the worst stories in a games i ever saw, non existent balancing and runs that can take 10 hours its hard to recommend it.\n\nThe length is a big problem, if you finish it in one go, the game is 7-10 hours long, but if you are more of a casual player failing few hours into a run will probably make your blood boil as you get into 40h+ of repetitive grind of getting stuck on some boss.\nDosnt help that \"finishing it\" dosnt come with any rounded up narrative, its an open to interpretation mess with no focus that might as well be summed up with \"it was all a dream\" or maybe not, who knows, game isnt interested in explaining anything.\nAnother big problem is that its not a typical roguelike, you dont unlock anything, you dont have to experiment to find what works, you get a linear progression of upgrades you need to progress and you will get it in a single run.\nFinally the difficulty, for me it was way too easy, but i could tell it was only since weapon balance is non existent, i just picked best guns and face rolled everything, yet  i could tell that if i used a bad gun the game would be practically impossible for most people. Im really not a fan of games that punish you to this insane extent for wanting to try stuff out.\n\nIn the end its not a sucesfull attempt at third person roguelike, Remntant 2 seems like much more of a success.",

All bosses I've faced killed me when they were at 10% HP. This is ridiculous. I will not get better with the controller. I could spend more and more hours with this game until I get lucky enough to kill the 2nd boss and... face more frustration? Why would I do it?\nThe most positive side of this game is to make me realize than my time is more precious than wasting it on Returnal.\nGood luck with the people who enjoy it. Maybe the 1% of mankind finds satisfaction in this game - it seems I belong to the 99%.  I had high hopes for this game but it was a disappointment. I wasted my money on it.",

The tech side can be a bit janky, frame gen is completely useless aside from making the game play like jello ripples on a trampoline.\n\nWith that said - still 8.5/10\n\nIf roguelites aren't your thing - red flag, you start over OFTEN.",

        "review": "The sickest, most creative game I've played in a long time. It still has me completely hooked even after I finished the game. You play as a deep-space astronaut that gets stranded on an alien planet where an elder sentient civilization met its ultimate demise. The alien technology and weapons are beautiful and reminded me a lot of the aliens from Altered Carbon aesthetically. The weapons and upgrades you acquire are so much fun to use even though the stats are randomly rolled, and you don't unlock all of the weapons until the last biome (biome 6). The art design, boss design, sound design, and every other aspect of the game blew me away completely. I will admit it is not an easy game, bullet hell is overwhelming at times, you die way too often as you're learning how to hack it, and it requires a great deal of patience, but I found the combat way more enjoyable and unique than most Soulsborne games. The bosses and enemies are a bit Lovecraftian and otherworldly. The level design transports you from overgrown forests with strange alien altars made of stone and advanced technology, deserts, subterranean frozen tunnels, and deep under the sea. I am so happy this released to PC, and I haven't had many issues at all with the port. This is a 10/10 for me. I love this game and yearn for anything even remotely like it.",

That's done and ready to play? Oh wait need to compile shaders.\nWanna get freebies and online festures? Login to your playstation account, which never works for me, doesnt have an automatic password reset method, their customer service always not working when i need to login and have insane wait time.\nStops you and tells you to use a controller, but doesnt force you to. My controller has drift, and am not able to easily fix it through the game nor steam. I always play controller games with a keyboard and mouse. Fine, ill use my dualshock4 controller eith this sony game. Oh, all the buttons are the xbox layout, now i need to experiment with what each button is instead of just look at them(probably can change a steam setting somewhere)\nVery impressive graphics settings and options with benchmarks to walk you through squeezing out all the juice out of your gfx card. Played the benchmark a dozen times and learned a lot about gfx settings and mine's capabilities, when i was happy with the settings, i started the game.\nThe main cutscene of the game played at settings waaaaaaaaay higher than what i have set, causing huge lag between audio and video, so i had to skip it. Now i'm still unable to reset yhe game to rewatch the starting cutscene, and still trying to figure it out..\n\nBig chance i'll return it and buy it again when i have a better pc or they fix some of the bugs. To yheir credit, they did warn that my setup is not supported at the start of the game \n\n",

        "review": "I love this game.\n\nWhat everyone else says about the design, visuals and sound are true. If watching the trailer for this game, or the YouTube reviews, make you think this is your kind of Sci-Fi, it really is. You will love it. The fast-paced, precise and challenging action is fun and addicting, and all the while it absorbs you in its beautiful worlds and well told story.\n\nI hesitated to buy this game, reading about the performance issues. But I gave it a try, and I'm so glad that I did. With a 2080Ti and 3900x, the game was more stuttery than other games, but to me it was still playable. I would get around 115 FPS at 1440p with DLSS. Now with a 7900XTX and 7800X3D, I can get 180-220 FPS at 1440p with FSR. And it is running incredibly smooth.\n\nIt's true that an unknown number of people have memory leak and serious performance issues with this game. Housemarque needs to address this for the sake of those customers. Looking at the negative review percentage can give you an idea of how many. I suggest you look into the forums to find out more. Just remember some people are giving this game a thumbs down because they don't understand that they bought a roguelike, and others because they think they meet the minimum system requirements, but they are trying to run this game on a laptop or handheld that is below the minimum system requirements.\n\nIn the end I wholeheartedly give this a thumbs up. Don't forget to try the \"Tower of Sisyphus\" content, it might be your favorite part.",

        "review": "I played this game for dozens of hours on PS5 when it came out - one of my favorite games ever. Couldnt resist dipping back in on PC to enjoy higher end performance. This game is not for every one. It's hard, it's punishing, its unforgiving, and the mechanics that allow you to get stronger between runs are not as obvious or intuitive as other games. It reminds me a bit of games like Sekiro, where its a game that forces you to learn its mechanics and play on its terms. If you don't, you'll have a terrible time and drop off. If you do, you'll be rewarded with one of the most immersive, flow state conducive, rewarding gaming experiences of your life. This is one of those games where years later I can still remember how it affected me playing for the first time. I wish I could wipe my memory and experience it for the first time again.",

I'd say beating the first level was the main skill wall i hit, but afterwards it would only take a few attempts to beat the other bosses. I'm not sure what the negative reviews about the graphics crapping out are, I think I played a 6 hour session and never had a single issue.

Basically it's a space rogue-like, but there is a weird weird weird mystery story happening. If you like 3rd person shooter combat or rogue-like games, you'll probably like Returnal. Most things are really good and I feel like this is a game made with intent for theme, setting, and gameplay. Nothing majorly sticks out as bad.\n\nI do think the price is high even on release. Might be closer to 40-50. Especially now I'd wait for a sale. I did feel like the optimization was not good on release. Hopefully they fixed it, but I am seeing comments that of June 2024 there are huge graphical errors. If that does not get fixed I would consider holding off on buying.",

        "review": "As a package, this is worth getting, and is at the very least interesting in a way that you wouldn't expect.\r\n\r\nThe story is a little nebulous, but in a good way. The house sequences about Selene's life are probably the best moments of the game, because they add tension so well. It's almost like the Silent Hills game we never got. You wouldn't expect for a rouguelite shooter to keep you thinking about the character and who they actually are, but it keeps everything just intriguing enough to make each run worthwhile. It does feel like they sort of ran out of time near the end and didn't get to flesh out the story as much as they wanted, but the multiple layers of symbolism at least make this tolerable.\r\n\r\nThe actual randomization elements are a little questionable; there really aren't that many permutations for each biome, and most of it comes down to whether a gun you get is helpful. There are some guns that are just straight up better in almost every scenario, and the same goes for upgrades. You can even tell that the game thinks some guns are nonviable because there's always conveniently a handgun waiting around near bosses in case you have a gun that just wouldn't work. In that regard, while most runs are generally salvageable, some runs just have a chance to end up on easy street through what feels like no strategy of your own. I think this probably impacts all roguelite games, but you feel it here.\r\n\r\nI'd say the weirdest thing is that it feels like there are two permanent upgrade systems. The first one is the explicit one the game tells you about, which is the ability to unlock new items for future runs. Some of these are shortcuts to help with restarting runs with further progress into the story, but most of them are just unlocking the opportunity for new items in future runs. This system isn't great, because some items are better than others, and permanently throwing a new item into the randomization pool that you don't like makes future runs feel slightly less possible. However, I think there's a subtle undisclosed second system where it starts helping you out a little with each subsequent run. I noticed near the end it would just sort of give me more free stuff near the beginning, even throwing non-hostile enemies into the initial landing zone just to provide a little bonus. I finished the game after probably 20-30 deaths, so who knows how aggressive this gets. Take this for what you will: on one hand, you know there's help for getting to the end. On the other hand, it might make your wins feel cheaper.",

        "review": "Excellent Rogue-Like, Sci-Fi, Third-Person Shooter.\n\n     Starting with the obvious: The story here is top tier. There's multiple ways to interpret this games story, as seen by the various videos online. It's mysterious, yet captivating. It gives good progression of information, as to not leave you totally confused at random points in the game, but also shadows information behind various details and descriptions like you'd find a Souls game. You can enjoy this games \"surface level\" story if you don't want to hurt your brain too much, or you can dig deep into the trenches and discover your truth of what the \"underlying\" story might be.\n\n     The graphics and performance are also excellent. I will note though that I have an i5-13600K with a 4080. I didn't experience any graphical issues that other users have experienced, so perhaps it's a rig dif.\n\n     Combat is fast and very quick to pick up. There's not 500 different mechanics to this game. It's as simple as picking up and playing. You have a weapon. You can swap it for other weapons you find on the way. Each weapon has a secondary fire/ability with a cooldown. There's traits each weapon has that's pulled from an RNG pool that you can level up to make the weapon better, and that's really it. There's consumables with different effects along the way but at the end of the day, this is a basic, fun shooter. There's no ammo, just an overheat gauge for every weapon. \n\n     So onto the not so fun part: This game is punishing. Note that I said punishing, not difficult. This game is also very difficult, yes, but the \"bash your head against the wall\" moments come from the punishment you receive when dying. If you've been around the block with Rogue-Likes before, this is nothing new, but to those that haven't, allow me to explain.\n     As you progress through the game, you collect different upgrades via Artifacts (free buffs) and Parasites (trade-offs, like Corrupted Mods in Warframe. 1 good thing at the cost of 1 bad thing). Additionally, you get health upgrades, up to a max of 300%. You also get Weapon Proficiency, which I believe is capped at 15 for Act 1, and 30 for Act 2. The more Weapon Proficiency, the more damage and extra neon homing bullets your gun shoots. If you die, all of it is gone. You will literally \"return\" as though you started a NG. Imagine playing Dark Souls, starting out as a Deprived, getting to Anor Londa with decent gear and +'d gear, dying, and then losing everything and becoming Deprived again and starting back at the Asylum. That's what it's like. With the exception of the first \"mini-boss\" you're supposed to die to in the beginning, I got to Biome 3 before I died and lost everything. That was a depressing moment.\n\n     When you die, everything resets. This is a farming technique for collecting Scout Logs, Ciphers, etc, because the game is like Warframe where there's \"tiles\" for the Biome, and when you die and \"return\", the world respawns with randomized tiles. There might be a Scout Log or Cipher that spawns in a specific tile, and if it's not there at the time after exploring that Biome, you'll need to die to reset the tiles. It's literally RNG hell. Note, in regards to story progress, you can skip to where you left off, such as when I died in Biome 3, I can skip through the enemies in Biome 1 and 2 and go straight to Biome 3. Provided a \"lock-down\" doesn't happen which forces me to stay in said tile until I kill all the enemies.\n\n     So why is this punishing? Because each Biome is generally harder then the next. You thought things were tough when you had all that health and those upgrades? Now do it as a lvl 1 scrub. You'll essentially have no choice but to try and re-farm to get some decent weapon instead of your starter pistol, as well as some health upgrades so you don't get obliterated late game. Ah, but of course, while farming, you die and reset all over again. Or perhaps you got to where you wanted to be, battled the boss and then died. Now you have to re-farm all over again because there's no possible way you can beat that boss with even less health, less damage, and no upgrades.\n\n     As you progress through the game, you realize that chests are basically useless as they primarily provide RNG weapons. Well if you already have a Weapon you like, then there's no reason to waste a key to open it unless you want to gamble a Artifact, which can be bought with Obolites at certain parts anyways. That, or level up a specific trait for a specific weapon which is more so endgame/completionist stuff. \n     Ether is only good to \"un-curse\" health upgrades. Using Ether on chests is a waste for above stated reasons. Ideally, you'll want to use the keys for locked doors to try and 100% the game (if you're a completionist), as some Scout Logs, Ciphers, etc. are in optional rooms, not main rooms.\n\n     Point is, the players time is incredibly important, and when you waste the players time, you're disrespecting the player and it gets incredibly annoying. I played this game back on PS5 before they had a \"suspend\" feature. In other words, if you played for 2 hours and had to get off, if you didn't keep the game running, the moment you left the game/turned your console off, it was equivalent to dying because you reset when you loaded the game back up. The game was very punishing at launch to the point where the Dev's had to add that feature and then some. I actually Rage Quit at the end of Biome 5, right before getting the final key to enter Biome 6 (final area), because I had to battle a Sentinal, which I killed, and then 2 Sentinals spawned after that and killed me and I lost all my progress. I \"returned\" my game to Gamestop so fast. Never waste a players time. \n\n     Of course, I ultimately returned to the game once it came out on PC :)\n\n     RNG also sucks. Like I said, this game is all RNG in regards to the tilesets, which effects collectibles. The collectibles are needed to enter \"Act 3\", so you have to get them if you want the \"True\" ending. The same goes for the DLC. If you want the true ending to the DLC, you need all the collectibles, which means lots and lots of farming, lots and lots of dying, lots and lots of RNG, and lots and lots of broken objects around you as you try and travel up the 60 stages of the Tower (you will NEED to beat the final form of the boss that spawns every 20 stages. The final form is essentially stage 60).\n\n     I suppose you could use a Trainer to save yourself a boat load of headache but some people like the suffering. Anyways, the game is genuinely a great game if you have a rig that can handle it and you don't rage quit it. It's a sin not to experience this game at least once. And by once, I mean technically hundreds of times before you experience the full games story since it requires you to nearly 100 percent to get the true endings. Cool stuff though.\n\n     Oh yeah, Co-Ops dead. Which is a shame because I wanted to continue playing it and also help people out who might be struggling with the games difficulty but alas, no one's there. You can only attempt one coop session per death. If your partner dies, you won't be able to do a coop session in that BIome until you die/return. But ideally, that won't happen, as you got two people kicking butt that can res each other, but you never know.\n\n     Anyways, great game, just wear a helmet while playing it.",

Initial few deaths would feel very discouraging because your hour or 2 long progress can be dashed in minutes.\r\n\r\nPermanent unlocks are weapon traits but it took a while to figure that out, You also probably get better with practise.\r\n\r\nOn the positive front, the gameplay is superb and it features at least two memorable boss fights that will leave an impression for sure. There is a secret ending which I haven't yet tried. Gameplay is fast paced and one must say you would generally prefer a break to come back to it later.\r\n\r\nFor all those who plan to check it out, there are three built in cheat in the game for people to figure out:\r\n1. Toggle always run on in the settings\r\n2. Aiming down your sight will slow you down, accuracy ain't required much. Go with hip firing and move!\r\n3. Electropylon Driver\r\n\r\nBest of luck!",

        "review": "Gonna give this game a thumbs up because it is a good game, however some elements of it are just not for me, and it's killing my motivation to actually complete it\n\nMain thing I wanna rant about is the weapons. oh my god they are all very underpowered. I'm 6? zones in currently and with the vast array of weapons on offer I would only consider 3-4 actually worth picking over the starting pistol. I AM AWARE that weapons get stronger as you use them more often and unlock their unique traits, but what is the fun using a very underpowered weapon for a long time just so that it becomes usable later on. I don't want to have to throw away runs leveling weapons, I just want weapons that start ok-ish, and then grow to powerful. Right now the weapons start awful and grow to decent.\n\nFor example, the carbine that starts unlocked is at it's base form is a good weapon, with traits that change the playstyle of it and increase it's effectiveness a little. A weapon later in the game, [spoiler]the tripwire, fires 1 tripwire bolt per shot, and needs to be chained onto an enemy to deal good damage, is kinda awful. the bolts are a projectile, so they're hard to aim, and you constantly have to alternate between shooting a bolt at the ground and then at the enemy for some mediocre damage. In this state it's slightly better than the starting pistol but nowhere near the carbine with no traits. However, with the shotgun trait, this gun now fires 5 bolts at once in a pattern and it's the most broken run carrier I've ever seen[/spoiler]\n\nNot to mention the whole range of weapons that are slow firing, 1 shot magazines, or the shotgun in a mid-long range shooting game. Recently I unlocked a weapon that charges a massive beam attack, but [i]slows you down while charging it[/i]. This is a bullet hell game that requires constant movement. Slowing down is death\n\nWeapons aside, this is a really cool game with fun bullet hell mechanics and a gripping story. Is it worth $60USD? Hell no, pick it up on sale, if your computer can even run it. You're paying extra for the graphics, not the gameplay. If weapons were just tweaked a bit, a little more damage, traits unlocked quicker, necessary traits for a weapon to be not straight up detrimental unlocked by default or on every copy of the weapon, game would be 5/5 stars. Currently though, the weapons are too much of a run-decider depending if you run into one of the few good weapons in the pool, can't be more than a 3/5.",

Having a performance benchmark in game is awesome.\n\n\nWhat's bad:\n- The amount of content for the price. Compared to other roguelike games this is expensive, even when on sale.\n- Some times it feels very unfair, like the difficulty spike of certain enemies was an excuse to force you to die and extend the lenght of your playthrought. I would like the game to be a bit easier in general too, like taking less falling damage and having more checkpoints near bosses or that those that you bought in another biome count. The general design theme of the game is don't get hit and if you do don't get hit again in a short period of time.\n- The early biomes have a bit too many items locked until you get unlock skills later. In my case when I unlocked being able to dive and walk over lava I never came back to the first areas of the game, so those areas were always harder than they should be. This is something that happens in lots of games, but since I find this one harder I feel like this is something worth mentioning.\n- Several important issues with coop. It seems like coop was an afterthought because there are several key points in the game where in order to even see the prompt to progress the other player has to leave the game and you need to save your cycle, restart the game and continue the cycle. Also if by some chance your partner gets kicked out because a disconnection, a game error or because they have to leave temporarily or for whatever reason, then in many points in the biome you are not going to be able to resummon him because you can't go back to the summoning sphere. Also your partner doesn't keep any progress made in your game, he gets your progress only when he joins you.",

I'm big into Souls-Like games, and this brings me a whole different level of frustration in a way that reminds me of playing Risk of Rain 2, and I love that game! The graphics are very pretty (I have a GTX 3060 by the writing of this review), however I did have to do my own manual fix for the cutscenes, since they all played in 4K resolution and caused massive frame drops, and I don't have a 4K monitor. But after the help from Nexus mods, I rarely see any massive dips in frames.\n\nI won't spoil anything for those who haven't played this game and wish to try it themselves, but just be prepared to die... a LOT :)",

Long term upgrades are minimal so runs feels only like training your eye-hand coordination for the next boss. I don't like that there are so few positive-only pickups in each run; Almost everything is a trade-off so if you're risk-averse then the game trains you not engage with any mechanics except shooting.\r\n\r\nLocomotion is hard to get used to at first because it's so quick and snappy, but it does help with the eventual bullet-hell flow state.\r\n\r\nWeapons have neat alt-fires, but fall into the trap of them being useless in many situations. Especially against bosses. Hope you like holding down left mouse button.\r\n\r\nStory is engaging and I'd like to see it culminate but to be honest I won't be able to get there.\r\n\r\nLevel design is dark and muddy. It's hard to traverse in third-person and breaks in the terrain or not always obvious.\r\n\r\nThis is the most expensive rogue-like I've played and I can't say it's worth it unless it's on sale.",

        "review": "Que jogo maravilhoso! Com certeza Returnal está entre os jogos que eu mais gostei de jogar na minha vida! Ele foi o primeiro e único Roguelike que eu animei zerar até hoje. Joguei sozinho, não usei o modo online porque na minha opinião estraga a experiência de jogos single player. No início do jogo eu tinha achado o jogo bem difícil, porém depois que eu entendi como o sistema do jogo funcionava e comecei a usar isso a meu favor, e eu parei de agarrar nas partes. Por exemplo, o único chefe que me matou foi o primeiro, morri pra ele 1 vez, mas todos os outros chefes eu matei na minha primeira tentativa, porque eu usei as partes anteriores do chefe para deixar o meu personagem o mais forte possível, e quando eu ia enfrentar o chefe eu estava muito bem preparado e conseguia matar de primeira. Sobre as questões técnicas, eu joguei em um PC com GPU: RTX 2080TI, CPU: i9-9900K, 32GB memória RAM, ssd de 5000 de leitura etc.. Joguei com resolução 4k com todas as configurações gráficas na melhor opção possível, com ray-tracing desligado, e desativei o borrão de movimento, a profundidade de campo e o bloom porque eu não gosto desses efeitos visuais. Usei V-Sync ligado a 60fps, e dessa forma no meu PC a performance foi boa, porém poderia ter sido melhor, em alguns momentos notei algumas quedas de fps, porém somente fora de combate, por isso não me prejudicou, e teve uns 3 bugs, 2 deles fez a tela ficar preta depois que eu caí em um buraco, aí eu tive que sair e entrar no jogo para voltar ao normal, porém não me atrapalhou porque o jogo voltou exatamente na mesma parte que eu estava. Vale a pena mencionar que depois que zera o jogo, o jogador pode continuar jogando para explorar e fazer o final secreto e verdadeiro do jogo, eu demorei 18h pra zerar + 24h pra fazer o final secreto, porém infelizmente depois que eu vi o final verdadeiro eu fiquei com mais dúvida do que eu tinha sobre a história. Única crítica negativa que eu tenho do Returnal além da performance que podia estar melhor, é o final do jogo que não esclarece nada direito, o jogo poderia ter tido um final bem melhor e mais interessante, mas mesmo assim o jogo não deixa de ser maravilhoso. Recomendo demais Returnal! Agora manda o Bloodborne pra gente Sony!",

        "review": "I really tried to like this game as a general fan of roguelikes, soulslikes and shooters. The atmosphere is great, controls are tight and the first couple of runs feel like you are really exploring some dangerous alien environment.\n\nBut the feeling of progression just isn't there. I am just running across the same rooms, while finding minor healing items.\n\nI unlock something decent, get to a boss, die. Then I get stuck with a shitty pistol. I die again after a few rooms, rinse and repeat. Exploration is just too much of a risk. You get hammered for a minor upgrade you can't carry over, provided you even find an upgrade. You open a door and most of the time it means health -50% vs damage +5%. Explore the full map and you generally end up crippled with a RNG weapon. Rush the boss and you end up shooting it at lvl 1 with something crap.",

Perfection must be maintained or your run is screwed, you cannot misstep or take the slightest damage or the run is broken due to losing your accumulated damage multiplier. Bullet hell combines with high platforms or nearby deadly environments such as lava or water, meaning it is easy to dodge into damage or death. Yes, water is as deadly as lava. Strafe off an edge or into damage and you lose. And the next run will be harder.\r\n     In other words, this game sucks. On the very basic level of \"Is it Fun\", no. It is not fun. It's aggravating, frustrating, contrary, unfair, & a massive timesuck. Other than that, you might notice between 3-hour failed runs the gameplay is good, on par with Destiny 2. The art direction is consistent & very good. But since you are a very bad mom going mad for your sins, you deserve the horrible waste of lifespan that is Returnal. \r\n     Read the positive reviews with great skepticism. These are elitist jokers laughing up their sleeves because they are cooler than you. Unless you are an elitist joker, in which case this game is for you!",

        "review": "If you ever wanted to play a Metroid Prime game rebooted by FromSoft, this would be it. Note: Beaten on the PS5 ~5 times already. Bought on Steam again to support the developer and run on superior hardware. \n\n[*][B][U]HIGHLY RECOMMEND.[/U][/B]\n[*]Recommended.\n[*]On the fence. \n[*]Play it when hell freezes over. \n[*]Avoid like the plague. [/list]\n\nOPTIMIZATION: ~125 FPS on 1440p max settings FSR with RTX on a 7900XT (about 80-100FPS native)\nTIME TO BEAT:  10-20 hours\nSIMILAR GAMES:  Control, Remnant 2, Prey: Mooncrash  \nSIMILAR MOVIES:  Prometheus, Edge of Tomorrow, Annihilation\n\nThis is one of the most unique and underrated gems you'll ever play. It's a 3D inspired Metroidvania with roguelite and bullethell.  This means you will have different, alternating levels and permadeath each run. None of your progress is saved after death. The enemies will also shuffle and get randomized as well as the guns and perks. The game is more on the difficult side - Dark Souls style with only the default difficulty setting. Death can come from anywhere. Bosses are unforgiving but not outright impossible. Originally when I played the game, I rage-quit two or three times after each death and couldn't quite get it. But with each death came experience and perseverance. Eventually it started clicking and I fell in love with the game just as soon as I started getting good. \n\nThe score and visuals are also phenomenal. This is where the bullethell comes into play or the amount of projectiles on screen (there's a lot, so much so that you could probably use it as a 3DMark benchmark). During combat you'll be forced to dodge and platform to stay alive while battling your enemies. Boss design is perfection as well. Gameplay is super quick, fast and precise. No hand holding. No timeouts. No long or tedious cutscenes either. It's got a sci-fi story about being stranded on a mysterious alien world with plenty of lore, secrets, and eeriness. Seriously the atmosphere is superb, filled with soul, depth, and plenty of feels. There's a twist at the end and though I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of the game, it's all about the journey, not the destination. Also what's neat is that you can play with a friend from beginning to end (Co-Op). And if you are still having trouble beating the game just to experience it all, savescum your way to victory with cloud saves. \n\nOnly downside is, optimization could be better. It's not Cyberpunk 2077 at launch bad but it's not Doom Eternal on a toaster optimized either. At any rate, I still HIGHLY recommend the game.  \n\nFinal Score: 9/10",

I did have one issue with one boss where there were way too many particle effects and my game crashed. I had to lower the graphics for that one particular boss. Other than that, I didn't really have any issues with the game. It's gorgeous, it's frustrating, it's heart racing, it's trippy, and straight up fun. It's a hard game to recommend to everyone because it is pretty difficult and the runs can be quite long. The more you play and allow yourself to get absorbed into the game, the more fun you will have. My friend lent me his PS5 controller and it was pretty neat to feel the different haptic effects the game has built it. I wouldn't say it's a necessary part of the experience, but it definitely adds to the experience. You can tell that the developers put a lot of thought and care into every aspect of this game. I would give the game a solid 8/10.",

        "review": "The general gameplay is fun, and the graphics and sound are good.  I'm running into the same error that some people are that turns everything into muddy Play-Doh after a few hours, which is annoying, but suspending the run and restarting fixes it.  Saw a fix for that in the comments, but I don' think I have the specs to make that work.\n\nMy big problem is the plot.  It starts out looking like a interesting alien mystery, with alternate versions of yourself, finding your own body, etc.  Great start, but it's clear they didn't really know where to go from there.  We get some great and tense first person sections that have great sound design, but they don't lead to anything interesting.\n\nSpoiler Warning:\n[spoiler] It seems to lead to a \"This is all just a dream\" style ending, where it's not clear if any of what you experienced on the planet actually happened.  Some people have pulled off that ending, but it's not done well here, especially as we are left with so many questions.  \n\nWe're told that you are the one who shot down your ship causing it to crash.  We're told that you drove the car that crashed in the past and also the one dressed as an astronaut that you swerved to avoid.  Your mother also had an accident that worked in nearly the same way, which prevented her from being an Apollo astronaut, but you are exploring a planet that is explicitly outside the galaxy, which would be an impressive technological leap.\n\nWe never find out who sent the signal that lead you to the planet or why.  Was the strange creature you see at the end a real thing that drew you to a real planet, or is this all in your head?  If it's in your head, why the hell are you imagining weird tentacle beasts and strange biological weapons? [/spoiler]\n\nAt the end of the day, if you're looking for a good 3rd person shooter rogue-like, this fits the bill.  Just don't expect a satisfying ending.",

I've also seen a recurring bug where the texture LOD will be stuck at minimum after the game loads or reloads an area, and this one lingers until the game is restarted.\nI don't know what's possessed Sony to leave the game in a state this poor, but this is not an inexpensive title, and we deserve something that works for the price of eighty dollars.",

        "review": "UPDATE: My point still stands for my original review, however I have found a work around that prevents textures turning to mush after extended play, and helps reduce (but not eliminated some stuttering). \n1. Update the Launch options in Steam (Right click > Properties > Launch Options) to use the argument -notexturestreaming. \nBe aware that this will load ALL the textures into VRAM so you'll need a card that has 8GB of VRAM or more. \n2. Disable VSync.\n3. Set the max framerate to 60FPS. I've found the stuttering becomes much worse over this threshold. \n4. Under Screen Optimization enable DLSS and set it to either Balanced or Performance.\n\nUnfortunately even with these changes in some of the later areas my framerate started to become really erratic and I had to restart which seemed to fix it. Not sure if its a biome issue or just the same issue as before with a different effect because it cant just throttle the texture stream pipeline.\n\nOriginal Review Below:\nUnfortunately (as mentioned by others here) this game suffers from a rather major graphical bug that seems to occur with extended playtime. Once I get about an hour or two in, the texture streaming just stops functioning. All the textures look like they came straight out of the N64, with a massive loss of fidelity. Around this time the game also starts to stutter with frame rate issues, which again is weird considering it looks like it should run much smoother with everything so flat and un-textured. \n\nThe only way to solve the issue is to quit the game and relaunch it (sometimes a full PC reboot is required). I've tried playing with the graphics settings lowered which only seems to extend the time it takes before the issue occurs again, but it doesn't stop it happening. \n\nGeneral consensus is this was introduced in a patch a few months back, and there is no real work around for it outside of restarting the game. Since then there hasn't been any further updates from the development team to resolve or even acknowledge this error, so buyer beware. \n\nOverall the game is a really good idea and solidly executed for the most part, but I cant give the game a positive rating in good conscience when such a glaring issue is present.",

After a few hours of playing, all models and textures revert to the lowest quality level of detail, so they're blurry and hideous.  I'll change this review once they fix it.  Since it occurs after 2 hours, I was unable to refund.  Thieves.\n\nAlso just a note.  The latest version of the game is WAY easier than at launch.  There are many added quality of life items and upgrades.  I'm not sure how to feel about this.",

I DO recommend this game however I need to give it a thumbs down due to some of the technical bugs that seem to still be in this game.  this review was written 5/15/2024.  Basically there is an issue where if you're playing the game for a while all of the textures turn to complete garbage.  The only fix is to restart.  There's also very inconsistent frame rates and performance issues.  I have a 3080 and am using the recommended graphics settings.  I enjoy this game but it seems to have been abandoned and in dire need of an update.",

Building yourself up over and over again only to be forced back to spawn no matter how much you try. \n\nIt's a fun, smooth, and responsive experience and it pairs beautifully with the PS5 controller I borrowed from an abandoned house",

I only get a black screen and the option to skip.\n\nb) The game crashed twice in 30 minutes, once to desktop and once with a hangup during the aforementioned black screen, when I pressed \"Skip\" and right at the 99% mark of the Skip circle, the game froze I could only restart my computer (luckily CTRL+ALT+DELETE still worked, although I couldn't see the window).\n\nc) The first thing I saw when I started the game was an Epic Games Installer. I do not want that shit. The store page does not say anything about Epic Games. AFAIK it is there to allow cross-platform play, but I would have liked to have been asked first before a rootkit is installed on my machine.\n\nWhat I got to witness in the first 30 minutes that weren't crashes, was intriguing. Maybe not purely my type of game, but the atmosphere and the early game mystery is very interesting. So if any of the above issues do not affect you or you love Epic Games (weirdo), go ahead.",

If you're looking for a comparison, there isn't a good one. \r\n\r\nReturnal has a great, dark atmosphere with a surprisingly interesting story that you pick bits up of as you play. For me, this separates it from other rogue-likes/rogue-lights. Many - if not all - contain similar story structures but this game's execution and the story itself is well beyond many others. For example, I'm playing Hades and a lot of people say it has a great story. I can tell you I keep trying to escape hell .. I think ... and I'm on run 50-something. Can't tell ya much else. It's boring. Returnal however, is pretty damn interesting.\r\n\r\nCombat isn't bad. Like many of these it starts out harder than it'll be later. Once you unlock more guns and especially a specific upgrade that can aid in combat incredibly, you'll fly through the first biome like it's a joke.\r\n\r\nThe second biome is a bit trickier but after a few tries (or a few more) it comes down to one specific tricky enemy that again, that upgrade helps with (which you obtain in the first biome BTW).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second biome you get something that really allows you to fully explore the biomes where you couldn't before and begin the third. \r\n\r\nThe third biome is a bit tricker and where I currently am.\r\n\r\nEnemies .. aren't bad. There's a weirdness. I swear with the same weapon some of the same enemies go down almost instantly where other times they'll take almost 10x the hits. Maybe I'm missing something, IDK. Maybe I'm literally missing and just not realizing it. I didn't start really getting good until a few days ago. This game takes some practice.\r\n\r\nStick with it. If the main game gets you down, there's the Tower of Sisyphus but you have to have beaten the second biome first. It's basically a gauntlet run but actually fun.\r\n\r\nI'm tired... I probably could have left a better review. There's so much to say about this game. Like any Rogue, some runs are great. Some suck. Sometimes you're ecstatic. Sometimes you're pissed. Luck of the draw bud. I'll tell you though, this is my favorite when it comes to this type of game.\r\n\r\nJust know one thing: Your runs are longer than average on here being what this is. If you play these games for short runs just be aware. You can suspend/exit and continue later however.\r\n\r\nScrew Ixion",

Beautiful graphics, lightning fast load times, and an endless mode? All I wish is that there was dlc, or a sequel. I originally bought this on PS5 and platniumed it, but seeing it on Steam had to support it, and play again. I cant believe how good this game is, and how slept on it is for so many. Try it, don't discouraged when you do not succeed at first, and just have fun. The shooting is addictive in the same way Galaga is.",

The bullet storm gameplay is sometimes overstimulating, but pulling off a difficult fight or room encounter in this game feels incredible. One of my only complaints for this game is that it is a bit too short, if you got the hang of it quickly it's possible to beat this game in just 4 or 5 hours since it is a rogue-like. So understandably the $60.00 price point is jarring because of this, however on sale I highly recommend picking this game up.",

I would advice every player to play it spoiler/guide free. Discovery (how to approach fights and so on) is a big part of the game. I think its a unique kind of game that cannot descriebed with a genre like rouque-like or souls-like, it's \"Returnal\"! :P.\r\nThe devs make very great effort to make it a good game for the player with listening to feedback, QOL-features that they aren't getting praised for but add up to a \"flawless\" experience. Stuff like vid settings that show you the change in realtime and so on.\r\nOnly downside was/is? the \"small\" amount of time until you finish it (~25h for me WITHOUT DLC). Haven't played the DLC yet and down know how much more gameplay it adds. For me it was one of the best games i ever played and the only question for you is if the \"short\" but extremly good time is worth the money (at least 25h!). In a sale it's a absolutly no brainer and i DO recommend it for everyone. Can still be a \"missbuy\" cause it's so unique but i would always \"risk\" it becasue it's so good in my mind that it was worth the shot.",

You can choose to if you want, or you can just skip.\n2. You can skip to further levels once you reach them the first time.\n3. You aren't so dependent on RNG from builds so you never really feel under-powered.\n\nAll of these things make the game so much more enjoyable for me.",

        "review": "Fantastic game. Reminded me strongly of Hades meeting Risk of Rain 2. \n\nFirst of all, to address some common things I saw in reviews: \n- Returnal advertises a strong recommendation to use a controller, specifically DS5. I didn't personally use a controller, and I think the game would be MUCH harder with a controller. Using a keyboard & mouse I still found it very difficult, but I'm pretty certain my enjoyment would be much less had I used a controller.\n- I only had some issues with lag, mainly during particularly intense moments with a lot of moving particles and monsters. But otherwise it ran pretty well for me on max settings. 3440 x 1440 @ 120hz, 3080Ti.\n\nWhen first playing through the game and exploring areas for the first few times, I was extremely immersed in the absolutely beautiful environment; you'd feel almost scared exploring new areas unsure of what's ahead, the variation of monsters/bosses, or unexpected environments since the map layout is randomised(not auto generated, just order differences). Even though you feel this way, you really want to explore every part of the map because at every stage of the game, exploration is rewarded and always feels good. Whether that's by getting stronger, finding secrets, or unlocking different parts of the story.\n\nReturnal has a really cool take on Roguelike, whatever that means. In each half of the game, you restart from the respective half, and while you don't persist how strong you get, you have a permanent currency you can trade for an item that might give you a tiny edge at the start, and all other progressions are guns or items you can find in the game. It doesn't make you \"stronger\" between deaths, but does give you more options and playstyles. I found the story very engaging, fairly interesting and had that Hades style where each run unlocks new parts of the story, even past the credits. \n\nOverall for me, it's a high recommendation if you're into these types of games. At it's core price, it's a pretty steep investment and while for me it was worth it at full price, in this economy it's probably better to wishlist and wait for a sale. I'm mostly done with the core part of the game after my ~37 hours at the time of writing, really all that's left is some story collectibles and the alternative game mode which I'll likely play around with, but otherwise I feel like I've taken what I wanted out of Returnal.\n",

Sparse but rewarding melee. But this game NAILS atmosphere. I struggle to think of many games PERIOD, let alone roguelikes, which manage to regularly pull me in with its setpieces, music, and tone. Areas feel open and empty as often as they feel suffocatingly claustrophobic, music swells and ebbs with each passing moment, in AND out of combat. \r\n\r\nSolid 9/10. Beat the game at least once before you go into Tower of Sisyphus. Also, Hyperion? Peak.",

The final boss is easy... the most epic boss was the mid-game boss (but still quite easy).\n\nAlso, the upgrade/roguelite items are pretty uninspired. They don't matter that much. The melee tree of items is also pointless since melee sucks and can't even be used on most bosses.\n\nIt was definitely fun to play as coop, but it's not a \"hall of famer\" if you are looking for coop roguelites.",

Aborting the install, or stopping the program from running in the background does not ameliorate the issue.  Only through deleting the Epic store all together does the game function, and even then functions poorly with graphical stutter and load hangs of a second or more when entering a new area.  All of this is a shame since I truly do enjoy the setting and the game play that I was able to play  for the 30 minutes or so that I was able to when I wasn't trouble shooting this port.",

Every angle you look at it from, the game excels at every little zoom. Sound, visuals, narrative, gameplay, worldbuilding. It´s sort of not ironic how this game flew over the radar of many, since its of such high standards and elevated art form. To the devs, please continue making this types of games, expand upon it, cant wait to see whats up next from you guys. Blown away falls short.\n\nEDIT: For as much praise i give the GAME itself, the software has been falling short with horrible memory leaks and weird video settings that wont let you select your screens native resolution. \n\nWhy do deveopers continue to punish the customers with lackluster support for their titles is really sad.\n\nI cant give it a positive review until this major bugs and errors in code get fixed, specially since theyve been reported for more than a year now.",

        "review": "Challenging in a good way, until it's not. \n\nPerfect port so it's a shame the game is so maliciously designed to just waste your time.\n\nEven Lords of the Fallen, despite its high challenge.. you eventually punch through. That's not the feeling I get here. Here you're just struggling endlessly through the same section dozens of times.. with the same level zero pea-shooter weapons..each time a total do-over, and you never get anywhere.\n\nThinking about it more, they painted themselves into a corner with some of the key design decisions they made. \n\nTeams should always ask themselves: Is this mechanic really necessary, going to make the game more fun? \n\nOr is this mechanic just an attempt to compensate for bad assumptions and bad design decisions? \n\nBy committing to a total stage do-over on every death, now you need to randomize the entire level so it isn't monotonous. A total do-over already diminishes your potential audience, and now you must commit to various compensations to make it work.\n\nIf your stages are randomised, they cannot have much depth. You're forced to template. So the rooms becomes relatively generic, with limited relationships or cohesion across rooms. The sense of permanence in the world is diminished - things the player already conquered are just back again and as we know almost no player prefers this. Acquiring items and progression requires little actual problem-solving, due to the template approach, so you add counter-mechanics like malignancy - again ask yourselves who actually finds that fun? Or is it there because you boxed yourselves in and had no choice. \n\nNow you need to worry about even the beautiful haunting first stage overstaying its welcome. The repetition of the combat music fading in every few seconds becoming grating on the player. Seeing the same basic enemies over and over again despite having mastered encounters with them hours ago. Picking up a health item knowing it made little to no difference. Picking up currency knowing it won't make any difference because the boss is going to require many more attempts. The list goes on. \n\nThe argument could definitely be made that choosing randomisation and do-over instead of more depth is what polarised this game and caused it to reach only a fraction of the audience it could have.\n\nThey had the groundwork here, and opportunity, to basically create the first 21st century Super Metroid. You can see the potential, but the heads of design in my opinion actually ruined this game without realising what they've done.",

One of the best looking and best optimised games I've played in a while.\n\nMy problem is with the structure, which is my general problem with all Roguelikes, even when I've loved them. Dead Cells, Hades, Returnal... You beat the game (Act 2 here), but then are expected to grind runs over and over to unlock the true ending. Even though the gameplay is great, I'm just not interested in that grind. It's a personal taste issue, so if you're the same as me, approach with the right expectations.",

I will even play the heck out of this game until I see all the achievements. Still gets a thumbs down for the inauthentic roadblocks they placed at every corner for the sake of putting them there. Returnal feels like a game made by a team who wanted to recreate something they've never experienced.\n\nEdit after completing act 3. The game is overall a good time. Still say there are some flawed decisions that translated into feeling like certain things were done to just be tedious and slow the player down. There was more good than bad. Changed to thumbs up due to overall experience being worth playing. There are a lot of rough edges though I stand by that.",

Rouglike levels, with rooms that connect in some of the most mind bending, beautiful ways imaginable,\nThe only thing that I can see as an oversight, are numerous invisible walls, dotted across places where you should be able to get with movement options that are presented to you, those boundries could be communicated in a slightly more obvious way.\nOther than that, I honestly think this is a golden standard of what gaming should do in the future.",

This game is incredible BUT difficult ... really difficult. But man the highs you get from pushing through the difficulty, it's like nothing else. Forget about beating bosses in Dark Souls, this game is where it's at.\n\nCan not recommend this game highly enough, but for gods sake play with headphones on. Audio is a big deal in this game.

        "review": "Played though this on PlayStation a few years ago. Bought it again here on sale to play with a friend.\r\n    I think this is the best PS5 game to date. Its not for everyone, but that does not diminish its quality. Anyway, enough about PlayStation. Now for the game.\r\n\r\n        Its a 3rd person Sci-fi bullet-hell rouge-like. It has a creepy atmosphere, stunning visuals, great game-play, great voice acting, amazing sound design, and a surprisingly intriguing story.\r\n      A while after it launched it received a free update. You can play Co-Op with a friend or matchmaking, which surprisingly doesn't seem effect the games balance much. And there is a new area with never ending floors to fight through with even more story added. Its great.\r\n    The only con I can think of is maybe there is a little too many items and stats to deal with. The loot pool unlocks more items and weapons the more you play, and there is a LOT. I like it personally, but that's the only thing I can imagine might be a con.\r\n      \r\n    This game left me thinking about it to this day. The story beneath is simple and impactful, and masterfully woven into every aspect of the game and world. Very intriguing to uncover. The game can be very challenging, but very rewarding to make progress.\r\n    You do unlock major shortcuts after each boss. You don't have to do everything again on each run. The runs can get long, so these permanent shortcuts are very welcome. You only have to defeat each boss and biome once to be able to run past most of it on future runs.\r\n\r\n    I HIGHLY recommend this one. Its not usually my kind of game but this one just felt special.",

Can only be semi-turned off by blocking it at network level.\n\n- The game crashes on first launch when compiling shaders with an \"out of memory\" exception. I guess my RTX 4090 with its 24GB of vram and my normal 64GB of memory is not enough for that game. Which funny enough just uses a fraction of it when it is actual running.\n- It does not have a main menu. It just throws you into the gameplay after the successful shader crash. Intro cutscene was not repeatable (wanted to share with my girlfriend).\n- They force PSN at you. Just to get the better \"Steam exclusive\" armor which actually is a PSN exclusive. You have to log in to PSN. WHY? I bought it on Steam because I dont have nor want a PS console and therefore am not interested of any Sony's <insert negative attribute here>.\n- It always trys to install EPIC <insert another negative attribute here> service, you have to cancel that to not get cancer. Modifying Steam's install script does not work.\n- The game tries to ping at \"rouge-pc api wwsga me\" and wants send data every few seconds. I blocked that \"wwsga me\" including other Sony's tracking domains entirely. No Sony, even tho you wont allow me to disable data mining in the game, I will do it on network level. Eat that. Game runs smooth. Will maybe impact multiplayer or make it impossible.\n\nBesides all of that <insert yet another negative attribute here> things above:\nThe game seems to be OK.\n\nBy not having EPIC running and also blocking the data mining and other domains + IP's, it runs smooth at:\n- average 180 fps\n- RTX 4090\n- 64gb ram\n- i9 13900k\n- installed on an nvme ssd",

Definitely have played this roguelike more hours than any other.\n\nTechnically it's also a shooter, but I don't recommend it for that. More of a platformer, than anything else.\n\nToo many reviews are talking just about the FPS, and not so much about the game itself. And because of that, it took me a while to give this game a chance. But I'm glad I did. The game runs more than fine, more on that later [ * ].\n\nThis is an absolute work of art, and a very unique game: a rather high-production roguelike shooter... a combination we don't see every day. I don't expect such a risky bet coming from Sony again in many years.\n\nThe game is trippy. The way the story is intertwined with the game is very interesting. In a way, it is impossible to make progress. In a way, it is inevitable to make progress. Like I said, very trippy.\n\nThe music and sound design are great. The boss fights are awesome. Jane Perry drives the whole thing with a \"Sigourney-Weaver-in-Alien\" kind of performance, for which she got a Bafta for leading actress... and then the game itself got Game of the Year, both deserved in my opinion.\n\nThe game is clearly made with PlayStation in mind, and that means a number of things:\n\n- Makes good use of the DualSense features: adaptive triggers, haptic feedback. Some of which I didn't even know existed. You probably play shooters best with mouse and keyboard, but I recommend the pad for the experience.\n- Not good for a small screen: 14-inch is as low as I have gone, and I think you lose the advantage of seeing far-away enemies.\n\n[b]For the PC port[/b]: I have forced DX11 mode, and I haven't really had performance issues. My review would be very different if I had, this game is quite demanding in terms of reaction time and FPS. No frame drops worth noting.\n\n[*] Holds over 90 FPS consistently for me on ultra (144Hz cap, vsync on, FSR off but DX11). Pretty much same performance as most modern shooters on this PC. However, I have observed that many people recommend enabling FSR or DLSS. In any case, you don't want to have FPS drops in this game, otherwise you are toast.\nPretty smooth performance on laptop too, which is less powerful but also smaller screen. I have played this game many hours on laptop, but I don't quite recommend this on a small screen.\n",

I wnated to play it on steam deck. 99% of times I had control issues, resolution issues, \"audio only\" issues, game not starting issues and others.\r\n\r\nThat said - the main problem is not really the remote play itself but the resoution change/minimizing the game. It causes problems locally on PC and make the game unplayable remotely.\r\n\r\nOverall opinion for PC is negative. With RTX4060 and Ryzen 3600 i was not really able to enjoy playing it on PC + 4K TV setup. I was declined to refund because of having > 12h play. Its understandable.

I blame wanting to evaluate the complete story which takes forever and being completionist on some of the achievements, though not all, because screw that.\n\nThe ultimate failing of this game is that there is too little progress as a rogue-like and you will repeat rooms hundreds of times due to needing to replay parts either due to an unlucky run, a simple mistake spiraling out of control, or just because some of the plot REQUIRES revisiting certain plot rooms or beating end bosses multiple times to get the \"true\" ending (and then the \"true, true\" ending in the DLC). It's pretty unforgivable that you can beat the phase 3 DLC boss, then not have that \"count\" due to not watching some walking simulator scenes in another part of the game.\n\nThere is a huge hurdle in getting past the first boss, then things get easier and repetitive as you go through rooms you already know with no surprises, but you have to clear them anyways as you need all the pickups and need to destroy the destroyables for more pickups. Screw whatever designer/programmer put in needing to destroy hundreds of pots per run just to see if they have health/coins/etc. Double screw whatever designer/programmer put in all damage killing your adrenaline progress even fall damage or damage on pickups (with a parasite or malfunction). And triple screw whatever designer/programmer put in jumping puzzles in a FPS with fall damage from falling in infinite pits.\n\nThe story was OK. Mostly just layered symbolism with no explanation, not that I need a full explanation, but the plot seems to be <spoilers>you are the mother, daughter, granddaughter who is dead or dying and are also mentally disturbed by generational trauma, postpartum trauma, and cycles of abuse.</spoilers> I get it. But doesn't mean that the story is satisfactory when it just sort of spirals around mixing symbols with a blender. The DLC \"true\" ending is just a sputtering out, which it kind of would have to be for an infinite rogue-like. But they could have done something else. I agree with another commenter I saw who said the main game should have been metroidvania and the DLC the rogue-like. It's a kick in the teeth to have to play the horribly repetitive rogue-like to get the plot.",

        "review": "Returnal is undoubtedly a unique project and a fulfilling experience, unexpectedly incorporating both arthouse-esque driven storytelling and roguelike gameplay under the same roof. It’s a difficult game about choices and risks that you take, that determines your outcomes of success or failure of your mission. \n[h3]Base game[/h3]\nWhile I understand that this game could be downright difficult, infuriating, and utterly beginner-unfriendly the first hours in, there is a steep learning curve that comes with it. Memorising mechanics could be rather tricky, which are ranging but not limited to: \n[list]\n[*] memorising enemy attack patterns\n[*] figuring out which weapons you like or hate\n[*] effects of consumables, artifacts, parasites, and certain feature behaviors of active items. i.e: If effects could stack or completely cancel out effects of other consumables. \n[/list]\nOnce you have a rough idea of what’s going on few runs in, it gets much more fulfilling and engaging from there as you will commit less mistakes that drastically raise your chances in succeeding in your run.\n\nReturnal’s story is heavy on metaphors, symbolism, greek mythology, and covers Carl Jung’s psychoanalytical concepts. The story boils down to exact same Jungian slogan of: \n[i]“There are three things in your mind: what you want, what you see, and what you’re supposed to be.”[/i] Represented in the matching characters as Helios, Selene, and the Astronaut. It’s also a game about loss, death, suffering, conflict in the perilous journey towards forgiveness, acceptance and finding peace and is very much open to a variety of personal interpretations.\n[h3]Ascension DLC: The Tower of Sisyphus[/h3] \nAscension introduces much more tense challenge mode, where arenas designed more compact with cranked up difficulty, but more firepower and consumables to balance the difficulty out. Despite having limited environmental progress (tower kinda remains the same after phase 3), I did enjoy this game mode much more than the base game, as the progression is much more fast-paced as well as it’s much more dangerous and rewarding.",

It all amounts to an experience that's completely unbound by Playstation Studios' typical cinematic inspired experiences. \n\nNot dissimilar to the chemical make-up that made Baulder's Gate 3 a smash hit, there is no precedent for a title with AAA levels of production within the C-RPG or Rouge-Lite genres respectively. It's the signature Playstation production values in combination with Housmarque's mastery of game-feel and design that juxtapose Returnal from every other Rouge-Lite/ Like within the genre. \n\nIf you have PS5 or an RTX 30/ 40 series graphics card, and are looking for something truly new and exciting, look no further than the modern classic that is Returnal.",

        "review": "Selene has a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell.\n\nDo you like pretentious? Seriously ask yourself this question. Sit on it for a minute or two & come back here... Okay, done? Regardless of your answer now, sit down & think on the next question. Who does pretentiousness serve? Is it you the observer or is it in fact the artist?\n\nWelcome back. If you answer \"yourself\", then that begs the question of function as to how it does in your favor. You can sit on that one more & return (ha) back here if you have a satisfactory answer. I for one do not. You may skip the last question in that case.\n\nIf you answered \"the artist\", then what is the purpose of you even being here in the first place? Again, think about it, just don't think about it too hard. None of this is that big of a deal anyway... You return once more.\n\nSee, nothing makes a blood vessel pop in me quite like the pretentious self-serving avant garde nonsense. At this point & just a disclaimer all of this is debatable. I don't proclaim myself to be the ultimate authority on art. But at this point as an artist you've given up on a dialogue between yourself & me the observer completely. You made a piece of media for yourself & yourself alone. Kudos I suppose, but why am I expected to pay for it & more importantly invest my very limited time into? Time that could be better utilized far away from this incoherent mess. For all its pontifications on the tragedy of life, Returnal fails to realize that the real tragedy is to waste it. How very ironic.\n\nLet's start off with the basics. The gameplay sucks. Selene's vast but very much underperforming arsenal hits with all the impact of a wet noodle (yes, singular). Also you don't even get to have the Halo cancer itself, the dual weapon system. No, a single gun is all you get. Considering how varied the guns are in utility, having at the very least two of them should be a no-brainer. But no, absolutely no brain power was spent to resolve this laughably easily resolvable game design conflict.\n\nThen the game dares to throw bosses at you with not two, [b]BUT THREE[/b] health bars. In my opinion any developer who doesn't realize the impact the health bars have on the player experience has to stand before the Hague. Nioh hit the nail on the head with its singular health bar bosses & the seamless phase changes depending on the health percentage. As for myself I was done with triple health bar bosses all the way back when I first defeated Sister Friede for the first time. It is quite simply an insult to throw it around so frivolously as this game does.\n\nThis connects neatly to my final & perhaps the most important point against the gameplay of Returnal. It's a rogulelike & it should never have been one. This game tries to again marry the genre with a metroidvania & I can't help but feel that it would be better off just being the latter. Fighting normal enemies is ever really a problem (more on that later). The bosses however are just a wall you hit every single time you face them & unlike Dark Souls which allows the player to learn the boss before defeating it, Returnal just sends you back to Helios. Have fun redoing the same level a billion times before you finally luck out with the boss. It seems the best strategy here is to just watch a video of the boss fight & try to memorize patterns like that, which I hope I shouldn't tell you is anything but a good thing.\n\nThere's one positive in the game that is spoiled by an artificial restriction on movement & that's movement itself. Yes, I have one thing positive to say about Returnal. The movement is snappy & responsive. It just feels good to move in this game. Alas instead of implementing a stamina system we instead get a cooldown on dashes which breaks the flow of the game. I understand that having iframes necessitates a limit, but why not just use stamina? You lifted a lot from Dark Souls already, why not this?\n\nNext to the aforementioned metroidvania & roguelike, Returnal is also a bullet hell game. If you played any bullet hell games in your life you know why they work & why this game doesn't. Making a 3D bullet hell is just a bad idea as most projectiles can easily be side stepped & since we have here somewhat intricately designed levels, most projectiles get stuck in terrain anyway. A good example is the minibosses that can be defeated by simply hiding behind a column, taking potshots at them from safety. The AI here does not help. It is really damn stupid. Your many foes can barely make a step without getting stuck in terrain themselves.\n\nNow, for the bosses this dynamic shifts of course. The arenas are open, meaning there's nowhere to hide. Also the last phase tends to unleash the actual bullet hell on you. Being low on health already that almost guarantees demise. But again, they're not even hard bosses. They are however a drain on your resources & a roadblock that one [b]HAS TO BREAK THROUGH[/b] in order to progress. That takes a while due to the artificial lengthening of the whole process through the magic of the roguelike. Yes, it gets exteremely frustrating extremely fast.\n\nI have one rule with roguelikes & that rule is: if the game dares to waste my time, then I'm not interested. This is why I to this day only ever recommend two roguelikes: Hades & Undermine. I even call the former \"the roguelike for the people that hate roguelikes\". I don't even hate roguelikes myself. I just don't tend to finish them, because the tediousness just gets to me after a while. To retain my interest you have to give me a reason to keep coming back, game.\n\nReturnal just doesn't. Permanent upgrades are few & far between, mostly just dealing with traversal. Hardly exciting. Yet another reason why Returnal should just be a simple metroidvania instead. Also we have a clash between the two genres even here. You will just invariably get burned by something you're not supposed to interact with because you lack a certain upgrade. Losing half of your health or even dying because of it just feels cheap & undeserved. Especially when the stakes are this high,\n\nNow. Does this game have anything at all to offer? Yes & no. The graphics is nice, but we have here the same issue the carcasses had in Lies of P. The enemies just blend with the background, especially in the lush ruins. Green blots everywhere all over again. I just tend to identify foes on the mini-map & reverse track them from their projectiles. Which is obviously very, very backwards. The atmosphere is alright, but the levels are very repetitive visually. The biomes hardly change in anything other than the color palette. As the result the game just looks the same from start to finish. It seems like every barrel of honey Returnal offers contains a fat spoon of tar. As a result the whole experience gets infected & poisoned the whole way through.\n\nI already touched upon an aspect of the storytelling. At first it intrigues you. But alas it doesn't stick the landing (haha). The ending is just as unimpactful as the rest of the game. It clearly took inspiration from Stanislaw Lem's Solaris. Which would be a good thing, yours truly being a Lem fan. Alas the lack of anything to say in favor of pretentious meanderings just kills it. That's truly sad, because Lem has a lot to say in every novel of his that I read. This to me is the crucial distinction between his works & the pale imitations such as Returnal. Also becoming the ultimate piece of evidence to support my original thesis. Returnal just doesn't care about your time.\n\nThis is even more so reflected in the \"true ending\" that apparently adds nothing more to the game & is just teethgrindingly difficult to achieve being purely RNG based. The fact that the game invites me to waste even more of my precious time for no payoff what so ever is adding insult to injury. Of course I did not bother. Neither should you in general with Returnal.",

You might see all the bullets coming towards you and think \"Oh no, how will ever be able to handle that?!\" but you will, with ease. I found the dark souls games WAY harder than this. I have this on ps5 originally so I have beaten it a few times at this point and helped other people complete it. Just great. All the cosmic horror/extensional horror in this makes it even better.

The biggest highlight honestly is the story, honestly the story still comes back to me from time to time. I highly recommend playing and preserving to see the story to it's conclusion. \n\n",

The crash seems random, you may have 10 mins or 10 hours before a crash happens, but just know at some point it will happen. Also, after updating my nvidia drivers to the latest ones the game now has FPS issues where it will play fine at 144 fps on epic and then after I restart the game it will have an fps of 18 - 26 consistently with no way to fix other than re-installing the drivers which allows you to play the game again until you restart the game (or it crashes) and then the fps issue returns.\r\n\r\nHonestly sony and/or climax studios should be forced to give refunds to whomever wants one because neither company is supporting this game even though it still has a high price tag. Save your money and your precious time and play something else.",

        "review": "I was looking for a good roguelike so I could stop playing Risk of Rain 2, but this game just wasn't it. It did capture my interest for the first couple of hours but then it turned utterly joyless. The game is clearly not optimized for PC -- just read all the other reviews about various bugs. For me textures would progressively stop loading the longer a run would go until I was shooting undifferentiated brown blocks.\n\nThe story has a few genuinely effective, engaging scenes early on that had me hooked to find out more. It turns out there's no real depth beyond those first scenes. Imagine a first year English major thinking themselves really profound for coming up with the idea that you can represent trauma and self-destruction as literal monsters, but not having the life experience to take that concept anywhere. I got to the main ending, was very disappointed, and just decided to read the secret ending online, and was really glad I didn't bother to try to play it.\n\nAs far as roguelikes go, I didn't think the game was actually that hard. At least, once you find a weapon you like and have leveled up your skills with it. The problem with that is that you can figure out the limited number of enemies and bosses much quicker than you can level up your weapons. This incentivizes you to not pick up and play with interesting new weapons, but just level up your one or two favorites for a few runs until you're ready to blow through the whole game.\n\nWhere the difficulty does come in this game is that the combination of bullet hell and 3rd person shooter really suffers for a lack of clear cuing. In 2D bullet hell games, you can clearly see every projectile, and it's up to you to figure out how to handle that. When you accidentally dodge into a fireball rather than past it, you want to smack yourself. Here when a wall of projectiles comes from some unseen angle, you want to smack the game. Compare to Risk of Rain 2, where I can be running like mad through a swarm of enemies, but the audio cues are all so distinct I can tell there's a wisp charging up behind me, a brass contraption loading over my left shoulder, and a malachite enemy spawning to my right. Maybe something with the audio mixing was as bugged as the textures were, but the sound design did not at all compensate for the limited perspective like it needs to in a frenetic 3D shooter.\n\nEven outside of the texture issues, the game likes to start you in an aggressively ugly environment -- brown, gray, wet jumbled blocks. I think the starting environment actually works just fine as a contrast to the variety of other environments, but it's a real slog to start there every run (and in fact the ugliness gets worse halfway through the game). Some kind of randomizer on the starting scenery would have really freshened it up.",

It's incredibly bad game design; Doubly so when you have to retrace zones you already 100% cleared to get to the zones you've already finished entirely to run through a map you've already cleared multiple times waiting for RNG rooms to spawn.\nI've gotten past the point where I am going to waste hours of my time \"speedrunning\" through zones to grab collectables so I can see the shiny 100%, but I also personally find it annoying enough to give this a thumbs down. Is it really that challenging to swap the multiple dozen rooms I go through in every run enough so that I don't have to do this after I finish the entire game?\nLastly, the game is not nearly as challenging as people love to pretend it is. It IS entirely a skill issue.",

        "review": "A somewhat interesting AAA take on the rogue-like \"genre\".\n\nIt feels like a chore quickly, I progressed through the second stage and then lost interest. This game feels like it is wasting your time intentionally.\n\nAlso non-sympathetic resting bitch face protagonist who apparently was on SSRIs in the middle of a plot that is a mix of \"Lost\" and \"Groundhog day\" without any of the good parts.\n\nThe story is nonsensical and the ending/conclusion unsatisfying, a good story is one most of the people understand and can relate to, not abstract shit about the protagonist's mother issues. And yes I get it the daughter's too, it is just explained in a nonsensical way that I have an issue with.\n\nThe graphics are too dark most of the time, the people who designed this game wanted dark with bright enemy bullets, problem is most of the time you fall into holes or fail to notice things because it is too dark most of the time. Here I question game designers who spend tons and tons of manpower into creating dark stuff that nobody can appreciate because... it is too dark.\n\nThe gameplay is OK until the moment you realize that certain actions impede your movement... in a rogue-like where enemies surround you, For example you have a melee attack, you use it and you're paralyzed for like half a second, you get pushed by an enemy you get paralyzed... on a rogue-like with several enemies shooting you from multiple directions at the same time... and the grind... oh the grind, there is no chance of beating this without grinding entire sections of the map again and again and again, no issue if it was fun, but it is not, it becomes a chore fast.\n\nAnother issue this game suffers from is the propensity to offer you upgrades that are not upgrades of the type that give you a meaningless advantage and a noticeable disadvantage.\n\nThere is no music in this game. The sound effects design is good, almost the only thing I really like about the game.\n\nDon't bother with this game, watch a YouTube video instead, save money and time.",

        "review": "I have never been so mortified by the words \"Completed Act 1.\"\n\nReturnal is something special.\n\nSo this game is a bullet-hell shooter, roguelike and metroidvania; in no specific order and it is deserving of all three. The story and setting is a dark horror.\n\nBullet-hell... Look at the screenshots! What I really like about this is the world's dark setting means the bright projectiles are really easy to see, so even when there's a lot going on you know exactly what's coming at you and from where. The same can be said about the enemies, they generally have bright colours so you know which way to point your gun. This game is built with heavy quality of life. You're very fast, have invincibility frames on dashes and the aiming auto-assist allows you to keep firing while using this high mobility.\n\nRoguelike. You crash land on a planet, wake up, go kill stuff and then die. Upon dying you have a vision and are returned to life. Each time you go forth on your adventure the world rearranges itself. The main biomes and boss fights are sequential but the biomes themselves change their layouts. The developers did right by it and there's plenty of variety in the biomes. The game is more roguelike than most because there are no upgrades outside of each run. You can unlock new items to find on a run but you cannot upgrade your character, this is a plot based decision as you always return to the point in time when you crashed.\n\nMetroidvania. Look... I don't think metroidvania games and roguelikes belong together... Then there's Returnal. To give an example I recently played Roboquest. You can get from start to finish without any of the extra abilities like a grappling hook. In Returnal, the game's Roguelike engine builds a randomised biome with the next essential ability along the way. When you die you ALWAYS start at the beginning with no checkpoints at each biome, so the game literally builds a new Metroidvania every time until you hit the end of the story.\n\nAs a horror it's creepy as hell! The world around you chitters, squirms and howls as you work your way through each biome. It's the story of a world of highly intelligent creatures in their post apocalyptic era. It's a harrowing and desolate place void of life and full of dangers. And to make matters worse, the first corpse you discover... Is your own, with an audio message in your voice. There's even a room with a depiction of your ship made from large stones and around it on pedestals like statues are more of your corpses.\n\nEverything from the mechanics to the story are spectacularly integrated together. Well worth the purchase.",

        "review": "Arguably, one of the best 3rd person shooters ever made. It sure is for me. Over 80 hours on PS5, 38 hours here (and going) and I can't stop playing it.\nIncredibly responsive, fast, fluid and insanely fun combat, amazing graphics and especially sound and particle effects. 360 audio with perfect enemy tracking and spacial awareness. Mind blowing boss fights that will keep you coming back.\n\nThe game is pretty challenging, especially if you don't have enough experience with bullet hells. It has long runs that can be stopped by a single enemy very quickly sending you all the way back. You will probably die a lot, over and over again. But that doesn't matter, because the combat and gameplay are so fun, responsive and addicting, that you'll be starting another run right away. However, if you get discouraged easily or just don't enjoy challenging games that require skill and patience, you may not like this, since it needs you to be focused and on point with your movement, otherwise your run is over quick.\n\nIt has interesting and deep psychological story and great atmosphere, but make no mistake, you are playing it for the combat. The combat that made so many other games obsolete for me, unfortunately. No other 3rd person shooter feels as good as Returnal, no other movement feels as good.\n\nThe game has that \"arcadey\" feel to it and reminds me of the old games that you had to beat in one go and can come back to try and get the highest score. For this there's a Tower mode that is endless and lets you level very quickly, trying to go as far as you can and get as many points as you can. Both game modes are super fun and have great replayability (if you like the combat).\n\nIt may take you a stupid amount of deaths to beat this game, but you will probably play it again and beat it in one go without dying, cause you will get so good and so agile that no enemy will be a strong enough challenge (well, besides the higher levels of Tower where anything one-shots you). The better you get in this game, the more fun it is to play.\nI am not even going to talk about boss fights in this game, cause you just have to experience this for yourself, just trust me that you will remember them for a while...\n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time, and I very strongly recommend it to anyone, who likes action games, and especially, challenging action games and \"roguelikes\" (although one could argue about \"roguelikeness\" of this game). This is one of the tightest, most responsive, dynamic and fun games out there, and it will make you sweat.",

        "review": "[b]tl;dr:[/b] Play \"Dead cells\" or \"Hades\" if you want a good action roguelite, if you are playing this for the story there are a million visual novels that have a better story than this.\n\nThis is the first time I'd like to have a \"neutral\" rating for reviews, but if I have to decide between positive or negative this game is on the negative side.\n\nPositive sides:\n- [b]Tight gameplay:[/b] The controls are very satisfying, the aim assist helps while not getting in the way. It's one of the best third person shooters I've played in this sense\n- [b]Deconstruction of the genre:[/b] I won't get in the details, but I have been very positively surprised about some of the plot twists in the game. Makes me wish more games would try to analyze what it means to be stuck in a roguelite\n\nNegatives:\n- [b][i]Very[/i] poor scriptwriting:[/b] I am not sure what happened here, but the main character is one of the main reasons I am giving a negative rating. She keeps on talking, most of the time to add nothing of value neither for the player nor for the story. She's also one of the character I've felt less emphatic about. I don't care about her struggles, nor her background, nor her issues. How they managed to write such a bad character is a mystery to me. All of the non-action parts of this game feel like obstacles to the real game that exist only to gratify the scriptwriters instead of giving the players something more. \n- [b]Roguelite?[/b] It feels like the designers of the roguelite part of the game did not really understand what it meant to play a roguelite and just took the \"random rooms + persistent unlocks\" part and called it a day. There is no way to build a character during a run. When you play other roguelite games you have multiple opportunities to decide whether to pick up something or not based on the synergies of your run in order to get to the final boss with a \"build\". In this game this is not possible. The things you pick up are so few and in-between that a \"build\" does not exist, it's just a set of random pickups, no matter how many optional rooms or mid-boss fight you choose to take.\n- [b]Useless choices:[/b] It's an extension to the previous point, but slight different. The game has some choices regarding some items you pick up, but they make no sense in most cases. There are some pickups that give you both a bonus and a malus, but in most cases the malus overwhelms the bonus, so you leave it there. There are some pickups that are literally \"This item either heals you or damages you\", which make no sense as why would you risk to damage yourself if you need heals? I would understand if it was \"This item either gives you a damage boost or damages you\", because then it would be a decision of whether you want to risk your safety for more damage, but in the case of health you want it when you need it.\n- [b]3D bullet hell:[/b] Make no mistake. I love bullet hells. Hell, I love \"Nier\" and \"Bayonetta\" to a fault. But there is a reason why this sort of \"Bullet hell / TPS\" games are such a rarity: [b]it's hard as hell to make them fair[/b], and this game is not fair. The amount of time I have been hit by random shots coming or, worse yet, by enemies charging in melee (because they are not even notified, contrary to bullets) from outside the camera view is too large for comfort. That's why games that do this in a proper way avoid some types of attacks if outside of the player view or change the camera type if they intend to go all out. Also it feels like sometimes bullets of specific colors hit you regardless of whether you dodge or not.",

It is a roguelike with bullet hell elements. So it is meant to be difficult. But despite the difficulty, the combat is AMAZING. It is difficult and brutal, but brilliant.

        "review": "[i]Returnal[/i] is a good game, but a bad roguelike. After beating it a bunch of times and achieving the \"true\" ending to the point it all feels rather pointless and esoteric, there are some major flaws pulling down what could otherwise be a great game. \n\nFor starters, much like how the term souls-like has become ubiquitous, [i]Returnal[/i] suffers the same flaw as many of its fellows: map variety. Don't get me wrong, in terms of the visuals, the game is second-to-none. Running this with raytracing and DLSS is a real treat and Housemarque have pulled off something that's deserving of the generational leap. (And there goes my only reason to ever get a PS5.)\n\nThe problem is that these sections are very, very limited and you'll quickly memorise everything, thus hampering replayability. The only thing that really changes is where (and which) enemies will be placed between runs, which doesn't exactly help the roguelike nature of a roguelike game.\n\nSpeaking of replayability, beating the game and progressing to the next set of biomes is made all the worse because in a game that should be rewarding skill and progress... decides to reset it. [i]Returnal[/i] has the baffling habit of telling its story through making you play through the game again from square one, ironically feeling like a Sisyphean task of its own.\n\nAnd by far the biggest flaw is that very story. The time loop trope has become almost as tiresome as multiverses in recent years and Housemarque decided to use cosmic horror to explore Selene's past and her connection to Atropos. You'd think that would be right up my alley, but the problem is that when I don't know what's happening or, worse, don't care, there's really no drive to learn more or engage with the worldbuilding.\n\nReaching the credits the first time took about 12 hours, at which point the game just ends and then has the audacity to say keep playing to unlock its true secrets. If that annoyed the hell out of me when [i]Nier[/i] did it, you better believe it does here too.\n\nI ended up beating [i]Returnal[/i] another few times, which might sound like a contradiction given that I criticised the replay value earlier, but as you get better at the game, runs can take an hour or two at most. At that point, I threw some podcasts on to see whether this true ending was worth it.\n\nSpoilers: it's not.\n\nTo even claim this is a full \"third act\" is extremely charitable at best, as all it involves is going through the same six biomes again to collect parts of a key item. There are no changes in bosses, no secret areas, nothing. On doing that, you get another short cutscene that doesn't really answer anything and... that's it. Seriously?\n\nSure, someone's going to argue this was a stylistic choice, that the game wants to leave everything open to interpretation through trippy imagery and metaphor, but again... I don't care. And it all feels like a waste of time... because there basically is no story.\n\nThat's not to say it's all bad, however. Movement might sound like a weird thing to praise, but damn, does it feel good... especially when you unlock all the upgrades like the grappling hook. 3D audio is always a neat addition and the game as a whole absolutely nails feedback. [i]Returnal[/i] lives up to the bullet hell name with some great music to boot.\n\nBosses themselves are... fine. Strangely, I found them to get easier as the game went on with the final one being the easiest of them all. This sucks given that combat otherwise feels amazing with a decent range of guns and unlocks to each, but it's not a huge deal.\n\nPerformance overall was pretty good, although I loaded in falling under the map on too many occasions for my liking. The first time I tried a daily challenge, the map didn't even load at all and I was left falling through empty space. \n\nThe amount of particles and stuff happening onscreen generally isn't a problem and there was only the occasional drop in performance. Given that it's the middle of summer here in Australia and I was playing in a hot house, that's more likely to be on my end than an otherwise solid PC port.\n\n[i]Returnal[/i] is probably the most neutral game I've played in a long time, but given how solid the foundations are beyond that, I'm willing to give it a recommendation, albeit with some caveats. I'm glad I got it on sale, but even then, it felt like it was pushing it.\n\nIf you're looking for a roguelike to sink a tonne of hours into, there are better choices out there, but for a visual feast with rock solid gameplay, it's worth a look. Just don't bother engaging with its story.",

        "review": "(on top of my 20 hours here, i have about 60+ hours on the PS5 version, and achieved all 4 endings on that playthrough.)\n\nat the risk of sounding hyperbolic, Returnal went from something that wasn't even on my radar to becoming one of my favorite games of all time. i'm talking RDR2-tier, one of the greatest experiences i've ever had playing a video game. at the risk of sounding like a total dilettante, it's one of the only games i would even consider putting the term \"masterpiece\" near.\n\nwhy wasn't it on my radar? well, i was initially put off by the progression/style of the game. i've never personally been one for the roguelike genre, as banging my head against a wall unrelentingly when i'm supposed to be having fun playing a video game didn't quite sound like... well, fun. i've never really been one for Dark Souls (tho, like everyone else, Elden Ring eventually won me over) and i'm just not a fan of this whole \"get gud\" style of game. i have limited time, i don't want to waste it on failing to do the same thing over and over. so, despite having a PS5 and everyone claiming to high heaven that Returnal was *the* game to play on it, some even calling it the game of the generation while the generation had barely started, i just shrugged and was satisfied putting 100+ hours into Gran Turismo 7 (which is far better than online discourse would have you believe, but that's for another review.)\n\nbut once i had worn out a bit on GT7, hit a wall in OlliOlli World, tried and failed numerous times in the Demon Souls remake (this was before i was won over by ER), etc etc, i was itching for a new game to try, and Returnal was sitting right there in my Playstation Plus library, waiting for me to give into the so-called game of the generation.\n\nimmediately, i was struck by the art direction of the game. the mixture of sci-fi and natural environments, the insane particle effects, the enemy design... it all felt fresh, unique, and intriguing. it made you want to push on to see what else you could find. that is, if you could.\n\nsecondly, i was struck by how goddamn hard this game is. it is unrelenting at first, punishing you for every single mistake without hesitance. any act of hubris will be rewarded with an act of swallowing your pride. but, unlike a lot of other games with this vicious gameplay cycle, there was something about it that somehow felt like galvanizing instead of demoralizing. when a mistake was made, when a death had to be taken, i always found myself going \"i know what i did wrong\", never \"what the fuck, that's total bullshit, i couldn't have done anything to prevent that!\" it's difficult, and brutally so, but it never loses a sense of being fair.\n\nand the more you try, the more you're rewarded. you permanently unlock new attributes for your weapons that help you push a room or two further. you learn enemy patterns and how to avoid them. you learn that there are i-frames you can exploit, all Dark Souls like. through an inability to say die and to constantly try again, the game slowly starts to reveal itself to you. persistence is rewarded, and feels rewarding, never begrudging.\n\nthen you eventually make it past the first boss, entering the second biome. and the world is just as gorgeous, but in a totally different way. you slowly unlock more movement techniques, and those ledges and ponds that were inaccessible before suddenly become havens for items that ensure further progression. it all builds at a slow, methodical pace that cues you into the main gameplay idea: the only way to fail is to give up.\n\nthe game truly clicked for me on a gameplay level when i realized this wasn't a game about accuracy, but about movement and defense. it has the pace and push forward nature of the modern DOOM games on higher difficulties, forcing you to always be on the move, always be aware of your surroundings, and never stop fighting. when i had this lightbulb moment, all of a sudden, i was able to progress at a far faster pace. and when you start to get that speed, when you start to get that confidence, the controls of this game shine bright. it feels responsive beyond belief, leaving you never feeling like you intended to do something that wasn't carried out. it feels smoother and more satisfying than almost any other game i have ever played, and is one of the only times i found that a game has stood out to me for its controls in a *good* way.\n\nafter fighting and pushing and displaying a persistence unlike anything i've been able to conjure before, i made my way to the end of the third biome, and all of a sudden, the story that has only been given to you in bits and pieces slowly starts to fall into place. first, the design lures you in. then, the progression keeps you fighting after dying a million times. the gameplay/controls keeps you pushing forward. but then the story starts to reveal itself, after you've already been won over by the minute to minute of the game itself, and it started to dawn on me that everything that has happened so far, every moment of struggle and triumph, has all been in service to the story of the game.\n\nthis beautiful wave of realization occurred that every single element and system in this game is interconnected in an unbelievably holistic way. every single piece of the game is intentional in a way i have never experienced in a game before, from the way things look to the way the game plays to the way you progress to the way the fucking game sounds... it all is in service to immersing you into a story and a person without you even realizing it. and as the narrative finally starts to blossom and you start connecting everything together in your mind like a crazed detective, the game deepens in a way i had never expected. all of a sudden, the game has a weight to every element that you feel deeply. the intentional nature of the design influences you to become just as intentional, and follow along a harrowing, heart-wrenching, truly masterful style of narrative that i truly believe could only be possible in the medium of video games. it shocked me, stirred me, made me emotional, and even called me out in a way that few games ever do. despite the brutality, the coldness of the world, the sheer difficulty of the moment-to-moment gameplay, this game is ultimately and deeply human and emotional in an utterly unique way.\n\ni won't say too much more about the story to keep this spoiler free, but by the time i hit the fourth ending, 60+ hours into a game i previously wouldn't even consider playing, i understood where people were coming from when they said it was the game of the generation. i still think it's too early too call something like that, but i simply cannot think of another game that balances enjoyable gameplay, satisfying progression, immaculate sound & art design, and a masterful narrative in a way that doesn't alienate but engages, deeper than almost any game i've ever played. it's a true masterwork that lacks compromise, but doesn't prove impenetrable. it's a fucking masterpiece.\n\nlong story short, Returnal is worth the hype. if you open yourself up to it, you will find yourself changed by the time it is done. and for a piece of interactive entertainment in an age where endless debates about the value of the medium being considered \"art\" or not rage on, i think one simply has to point to Returnal as an example of how a video game can be both: an entertaining video game and an undeniable work of art. simply, Returnal is one of the greatest games i've ever played, and probably ever will play, and i implore you to simply give it a chance.",

        "review": "If you like Hades for its gameplay and difficulty in the beginning I think you'd enjoy this kinda game. It plays very similar to Hades IMO except in a 3D way and it's much less forgiving than Hades because of the fact that you can fall off the world on top of all the ways the game tries to punish you. \n\nAlmost everything in this game is against you, weapons are RNG drops that can screw you, so are health drops, or money or what shows up in the shops or rewards etc. This game plays so fucking fast that it's a test of your skill even without any enemies on the screen lol, just moving around the rooms there can be traps all over them which will test your movement. So overall it's what many would consider a difficult game, many won't be able to finish this game's first boss even.  The game isn't like Hades in the sense that msot of what you get from dying doesn't truly make you that much stronger you can unlock gun perks and you won't have to fight bosses again, you can also unlock the ability to get new upgrades and then a few tools to help with the game. It does add up but isn't as impactful as in a game like Hades. \n\nI think if you come from Roguelikes though it should be fine for most of these people. There are aspects of jagged terrains which nullify running and some weird environment choices I don't agree with, but the game itself plays very well and I found it very fun ultimately. The graphics are great on PC, however I found a crazy amount of issues with things like shadow pop ins and other weird texture issues on this game even on a 4080. The shadow and lighting pop in was horrible and it gets noticeably worse in the later levels of the game. \n\nI don't want to spoil too much about the game but the bosses are all good and very cinematic yet challenging when you first approach them, I recommend not using a guide to fully enjoy the game tbh and learning what the bosses will do, haha jk you're not gonna wanna die after spending 3 fucking hrs on one run. But honestly I didn't except for the final boss and it was honestly kinda awesome just seeing these bosses first time without any idea what they did or how they would look. The game has a visual presentation about it that's really unique similar to how Control's environments are except in this case with enemy designs and the bullet hell you're in. \n\nThe worst part  about this game? This fucking story is a mess, I won't spoil this either but this has one of those \"we gave you the information now you figure it out\" stories, no motherfuckers YOU figure it out. You wrote this bizarre story you could've went with a straightforward approach like Hades but you decided you wanted to do a deeper type of thing, at least give a good conclusive ending to this story or explanation, NOPE open to interpretation! I didn't find myself liking the main character or any of the characters in the game I know it's 2020 so forgive me for not liking the butch scientist female astronaut, yea I'd rather play a hot girl. But if you're gonna do the 2020 thing at least make a good story  for me to enjoy. \n\nOverall 7/10 there's flaws to it in gameplay, graphics, story, and design but overall it's very fun and challenging.",

        "review": "I'd give it a 9.8/10 (for some slight technical issues).\n\nI was waiting to play it on the PS5, but by the time I started playing it, it was already out (and patched) on PC  as a superior version with full Dual Sense support (absolute must for the full experience).\n\nI know Housemarque studios quite well, loved all their games so far. This title, however, marks their first attempt at a \"triple A\" production. And what a \"triple A\" debut it is! \n\nLet's be honest, the game was a pain in the ass on launch (no ability to save the game, PC performance issues). As it is, the game is now (after the patch) fantastic. An absolute masterpiece for anyone who gives it a chance.\n\nStand out features:\n- The usual Housemarque gameplay - pure arcade level perfection.\n- Incredible worlds brought to life in an astonishing way. The art direction is absolutely outstanding. Words and videos simply cannot sufficiently describe the awe you experience on each level of this game. Mind blowing!\n- Very cool and original storytelling used to convey a very unusual history.\n- Replayability after finishing the game.\n\nNot so great aspects:\n- Some stutter (mostly first level aka BIOME). A non issue after a while, unwelcome nonetheless.\n- Four great weapons, but the rest is pretty useless.\n\nOther things to keep in mind:\n- The game is quite unusual for console gamers. For PC audience it might seem even more unapproachable at first.\n- Ray-tracing reflections transform the way the game looks (LOW setting is amazing, and the difference between LOW and EPIC is negligible). It's visual impact doesn't quite show early on, but from 3rd BIOME on, it's undeniable. RTX shadows are the opposite, little impact overall.\n- Stunning in 1440p.\n- After you finish the game, go to the mods website. Amazing mods and make replaying the game so much fun!\n\n",

When i move too fast though, the FPS tanks and i can feel it. I still dont know if i can see the stutter that most have warned me of, but the gameplay is good enough for me to ignore the issues!",

The game turned into a blob akin to if you activated a potato mode mod. Very bizarre... I'll look into the issue and share solutions if I find any. I will still leave the review as negative because frankly an issue like this is downright embarrassing.\n\nOtherwise, game feels real good to play, especially on a dualsense controller (those vibrations... that left trigger... uuuoohhhh...), the game looks good and and the story seems intriguing so far.",

Now, I have to level up again to go back to the desert level and progress through it all  again without all the great artifacts that I had. Mind you, I've only died twice and had to restart once because of a glitch. Still a fun game but they need progress save locations and those reconstructor rooms don't activate in the desert level, didn't even find one there. I'll have to come back to this once the memory of losing everything becomes more distant.",

(One of the best to do it!)\nSolid, crisp combat. Interesting take on Roguelite\nIntense, reflex-driven and tactical combat scenarios \nEnhancements and gear progression feel very rewarding and the resulting \"builds\" make you feel stronger\nInclusion of multiplayer was smart!\nCons:\nToo short, and very abstract, so at times gets incoherent and some may not find closure and completion in doing/discovering things\nMelee combat could be improved upon\nSmall, annoying bugs that can interrupt gameplay",

I haven’t finished it, and I have no intention to. I beat the first half of the world and when they ended my run there for story reasons; I just had no desire to push through. I just play these games wrong. I got all the way to world three on my third attempt. All bosses I attempted, I beat them first try.\nNot because I’m ”pro-gamer #TTV”, but because if I don’t I won’t have the drive to play my way there again xD\n\nI don’t might griding a tough boss or section or such, but I just feel like this genre is a waste of time.\n\nMy whining aside… Returnal is pretty darn competent. The story is a bit too serious for what the game actually is. However, there is interesting stuff there, and there are threads tugging at a bigger theme. There is a clear existential focus: who are we, where are we going and why are we going there? It’s portrayed nicely against the sci-fi backdrop of space – since space seems to so easily beacon these types of questions.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it’s intense and the shooting slaps. It has a rapidness to it that seems heavily inspired by “shmup-games” (bullet hell games). The frantic nature makes you feel pressured while being forced to make critical decisions or your run ends. Good ingredients for a rogue-light. While further enchanting the experience are a set of amazing guns. The shooting feels very unique to the game with each gun shooting what feels like a firework’s worth of crud out of each round xD\n\nCombat plays well, the one thing that pissed me off was that sometimes bullets are hard to decern in all the chaos. I’d like for all enemy projectiles to be ONE color and not a slew of colors. It loses some stile, but it would serve gameplay better.\n\nOverall, this game is good, but if you don’t care for the genre; it might not be worth it. \n",

I'm not even a fan of the genre, but I love Returnal for its very immersive and fascinating world, the interesting story, the great sounddesign and very atmospheric music - and for its addicting fast and responsive gameplay, of course. After Phantom Liberty this is my favourite game of 2023.\nI've been playing since the PC-release (was interested since the Playstation-trailers, but I don't have one) and everytime I begin a cycle, I'm immediatly pulled back into this mysterious and lonely world and despite the fast paced action I often just stand around and suck in the atmosphere, listening to the amazing music and thinking about this strange world, almost getting a warm shiver because of the thoughtful loneliness it exposes me to. Even after over 75 hours and countless rounds that happens to me - I still can't get enough of this game.\nConcerning the technical issues that some players are experiencing: I have a mid pc, play in full hd and it runs smooth (some very minor stutters here and there). Give it a try, its absolutely worth it.",

The movement is reminiscent of early Fortnite with the painfully floaty and indecisive direction. The simple act of reloading feels like a punishment for daring to fire, as if the developers could not come up with one new idea so they settled on removing the most basic mechanic and replacing it with frustration embodied. If I met one of the devs in person I would box their ears and kick them in the balls. Or whatever they have between their legs. idc.",

        "review": "I really liked this game; although I do think it is technically better solo. Co-op was added as a post-launch update and feels a bit afterthought, the majority of loot is not instanced to individual players so you are basically cannibalizing each other by playing together. This game is basically a third-person bullet hell shooter roguelike (similar to Risk of Rain) and you travel through a series of biomes, clearing procedurally-generated rooms and fighting Eldritch horror-like xenomorphs, collecting upgrades and weapons along the way. \n\nHealth is _not_ dropped by enemies, only currency, so the game is pretty unforgiving, and there is very little in the way of permanent progress with the exception of certain upgrades that are more metroidvanian in nature in how they expand what areas are available to you (for example, clearing Biome 2 earns you a grappling hook which will open up certain optional paths in Biome 1 and subsequent biomes rather than actually bolstering your combat prowess. Most games in this genre released today (which would technically be considered 'roguelite') allow you to do things like permanently expand your HP pool (e.g. Hades) so subsequent runs are a bit easier and you don't feel like you're completely starting from scratch on each run, and/or they spoon feed you guaranteed upgrades at the end of clearing a room (e.g. Gunfire Reborn, Roboquest); Returnal does NOT do that. As much as I enjoy this game I frequently play it in short bursts because I don't really like doing more than one or two runs in one sitting for this reason. \n\nThe cosmic horror feel combined with the brutal difficulty really do a good job of instilling a genuine sense of uneasiness and fear in the player. \n\nAlthough this game has keyboard and mouse support as you would expect and as a shooter feels pretty good on it, I personally opt to play this game on the DualSense as was intended by the developers when they conceived for this title on the PS5. After some controller adjustments (rebinding jumping and dashing to the shoulder buttons, and melee attack to the thumbstick) I find this to be my preferred way to play, the haptics just feel too good with this game. \n\nThe game also looks amazing although sometime the bloom effects can be a bit overwhelming (although I feel that it is necessary in this game because of its emphasis on bright light effects). It is well optimized for PC and has support for the likes of FSR/DLSS among other upscaling algorithms. Sadly it does suffer from some glitches especially when playing in co-op, like not being able to interact with an item for example. These happen almost never in single-player. \n\nAll in all it is a definite recommend but it is not for the faint of heart for sure. .",

It feels fun and rewarding when you have a good run with powerful items and you find neat synergies between your artifacts, weapons and consumables.\n\nMy only negative, is the occasion slow-down during hectic boss fights and even some game crashes. The game feels poorly optimized for PC. To be fair, the game DOES give you a warning at the start if your hardware isn't up to the task. However, I am able to reduce the number of crashes by setting the graphics to low and clearing the shader cache before each play session.\n\nIf you have a decent rig, I really think you will enjoy this game if you like Sci-fi, rogue-lites and bullet-hell shooters.",

The amount of satisfaction that is felt when you first cleared each act is unlike anything I've experienced in a long time. Each boss gives such a sense of awe and appreciation to the design and abilities they'd do. Once the game clicks, you just want to keep going. I adored this game so much to the point I could not put it down and had to get all achievements which is something I rarely do in games.\n\nThe games story was pure satisfaction, yet leaves room for interpretation. It works perfectly for a roguelike. Never will I experience a game quite like Returnal again I feel. Returnal is such a unique game unlike anything before it. A moment of respite, at least. This was earned.",

It’s beautifully atmospheric and balletically fluid—once you get the feel of it and get into the flow of the combat, you can sort of zone out and dance with an endless parade of vicious glowing tentacle monsters. It’s hard: if you’re not careful or even if you’re just unlucky you can die incredibly quickly and have to start over again. But it’s (usually) fair, too—once you learn the attack patterns and your own movement well enough, you can get through an entire area completely untouched, which is extremely satisfying after the many, many times you died there before. The story is sparse and mysterious, but piecing it together over the course of the game to try figure out what’s going on and how you got here helps motivate you to keep trying.\nI’ve spent a bunch of time writing this which I would rather have spent playing this game. Which I’ve beaten more times than I can remember. Make of that what you will.",

Does take a lot of HW to run on high settings. \n\nStory is complex with several possible conclusions.",

Aside from the literally 20+ crashes.\n----------\nFirst off, I LOVE this game. It's the only AAA roguelike out there, and I mean that as a compliment. \n\nBut it's an unstable port. The number of times I've been kicked out of runs for no reason - a \"no reason\" that replicated when I run past that same spot when I load back in, without AT LEAST a reboot, if not a full file verification - is upsettingly high. Like, at least 10 times in 20 hours. \n\nThe quality of PS games seems pretty high, folks! Unfortunately, they don't know how to get them running on PC. \n\nHopefully they fix this before long, and I'll change my review - because the gameplay is stellar. I just don't like having to reboot twice in a single run. Kind of kills immersion.",

Because of Epic.\n\nEdit.\nI uninstalled Epic and its launcher and re-installed GPU drivers+updated Bios and now Returnal seems to be running fine without regular crashes like before so i'll say recommended since the game is good.\nExamples of some of the things i like about this game are.\nThe adrenaline mechanic of getting stronger by racking up kills and not being hit.\nI dont play multi-player or co-op much these days but this game has a good co-op mode.\nThere's a survival mode i haven't unlocked yet that seems like it'll be a good mode.\nThe roguelike element were you dont know if next item you find is going to be permanent or not.\nThat's all i can remember right now because its been a while and i'm still in the first section.\n\nWhy is Demon souls remake not on PC yet when this and other Sony games are ?",

        "review": "This is not a bad game. It has a lot of good things going for it: cool art (very much inspired by Prometheus), smooth controls, intriguing story, good level design, shooting can be very satisfying. But ultimately the game is more frustrating than fun.\n\nI am not opposed to challenging games. I love Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Elden Ring. This game requires a lot of the player and is quite random. The last part comes with the territory of rogue-likes. However, I think there are a few design elements that make it frustrating to keep playing through it:\n\n1. Each play through can be quite long. So if you die you end up loosing a lot of time\n2. There is not much meta-progress. You add new items and weapons to the pool of things you can find. There are a few traversal mechanics that you unlock. But you start each run fresh. I guess this can be a plus or a minus depending on your preference.\n3. The game is randomly super hard. Eg some rooms spawn mini bosses which have extra abilities and if the room is small you can get wiped out  very quickly. Also some items have \"malfunctions\" which range from minor inconvenience (scrambled map) to incredibly dangerous (max health reduced by half, ie you die in like 2 hits) or just nothing happens at all.\n4. After you clear the room of enemies, you need to collect all the loot. This can be quite tedious. The rooms often have fairly large and complex 3d design which is awesome during combat. But afterwards you need to spend like 5 mins running and grappling around collecting everything. Also breakable \"containers\" often have valuable stuff so I feel obliged to try to get most of them just in case. This wouldn't be an issue if you didn't have to repeat the same levels so many times.\n5. I think the items you find don't alter the gameplay enough. They give you buffs/debuffs but ultimately you play the game the same way.\n6. Some of the later levels have a lot of platforming. Like you have to dodge moving lasers and jump on small platforms. And I think the controls are not quite precise enough for that. \n\nI think non of those elements are uncommon in rogue-likes but taken all together can be frustrating.",

Way to get creative there guys!!\ni did overall enjoy my time but I wouldn't recommend it for the price point. took me about 28 hours to beat and about 7-9 attempts (3-5 per 3 lvls). i spent a lot of time in each area really min maxing everything so an average person could probably beat it in 20 hours.",

I used a PS5 Dual Sense controller, haptic feedback was super cool and well implemented. \n\nThis game blended genre's being a 3rd person shooter Rogue-like combined with bullet hell mechanics. Very well implemented mechanics, the beginning biome is still a challenge even after endgame with all the unlocks. My only gripe is that the bosses are too easy, hence 9/10. If this game had bosses like Remnant, or a Souls-like with higher damage output it would be a 10/10. Bullet dodging is super fun, movement is SUPER smooth, shooting and using abilities makes you feel powerful.\n\nI DID have framerate drops while opening doors or chests but nothing big enough to demerit the game. All in all the port worked fine for me on PC. I am running a 3070ti with an M.2 drive and an Intel 13700k i7 CPU. In 2024 I think that's mid tier for PC gaming.",

        "review": "It's like an abusive relationship but the p*ssy game is strong you can't brake up with her. THAT is this game, it's very difficult but I'm coming back for more. Movement is fluid, gunplay is good, story is intruiging.. The only downside is the optimization, I'm having some VRAM leak. Textures lowering for about 2 hours of gameplay. Restarting the game fixes it but comes back again after 2 hours. Good thing it doesn't affect the FPS because that'll kill you in the game. You need split second dodges. I don't think 10gb of vram of my 3080 is not enough for this game though.",

        "review": "Hard to recommend but it comes very close. The game has an interesting story (so far), great sound design, the combat feels so so good, and its very challenging in a satisfying way ala dark souls.\n\nI dont recommend it for a few reasons:\n\n1. This game has some serious readability issues. The UI is way way too stylized to be helpful at all. Clean icons are ok, but theyre so simple its almost impossible to understand what your consumables are or do. The blueish enemies are shooting blueish orbs against a blueish background while your crosshair and other vital UI information are the same blueish color. The game has a difficulty that demands quick reflexes and spacial awareness, i love it; the UI has NO place adding to the difficulty. Risk of Rain 2 has 1000x more happening on screen and its still more readable than the simple few things happening on screen in this game.\n\n2. The story is very conducive to a rogue like game, Its proabably the only one to do so and I praise it for that, BUT the upgrades and progression in a run dont feel all that great, which is kind of the opposite of every other roguelike. Most of the artifacts and parasites that you collect dont FEEL like they are doing much of anything. You have to jump into the menu and read the description to even remember that you have collected much of anything.  It puts the game in a pretty unique for the genre position, skill seems to matter much more than luck of the draw, which kinda begs the question of if this game should have random elements at all. The story begs that it should be, but the lack of dopamine i get from the rest of the roguelike elements isnt much of a carrot.\n\n3. Just put a fucking reload binding in the game. Theres an active reload like Gears of War, but uses the same button as shoot to activate it. This combined with the crosshair ui blending in with literally everything else in the game that makes it almost impossible to tell when you are running low on ammunition or even starting a reload, a causes the player to miss the active reload almost immediately when shooting a semi-automatic weapon, say the starting pistol. This is the most braindead, easily solvable problem ive ever seen in a game. Its indefensible. At best someone could say they dont mind it",

Really punishing early on, but the trickle of upgrades and new weapons was enough to keep me interested.\nThe story is woven into the game in a mostly unobtrusive way. It can be a bit confusing at first, but makes much more sense near the end. The final cinematic of act 1 gave me chills. It's definitely not the main draw of the game, but it's there if you're into it.\n\nI didn't experience any of the major issues some other users reported. I did see some slowdown in act 2 during later chapters, but it was mostly limited to opening and closing the map screen. \n\nI bought it on sale and it was definitely worth the price. I've finished the main game, but still have to complete the tower of Sisyphus. 8/10",

        "review": "Cons: The optimization~ 8700k 2080ti gets at best 60fps and in the other biomes it's 30-35 at 1080p all low settings and everything off.\n\nThe lack of information~ What does Killsight do? What does Enlarged Chamber do? I enjoy figuring things out but only to an extent.\n\nThe Co-op~ Why is there a twenty foot tether system? If I use a \"Proximity Translocator\" as a non-host it just tethers me right back to the host because it took me twenty five feet away AND only one person can use it at a time so as non-host you just stand there for fifteen seconds waiting, so much fun. We installed a mod that removes tether after ten plus hours and the game worked fine, I was 900m away from the host, no issues. Some items and things are host only, so again, as non host just stand there. The currency that monsters and things drops disappears in about 4 seconds so playing co-op means you get even less because spreading out is better for survival, so a mod was installed to fix that and game was vastly more enjoyable. Again, as a non-host, you get shafted with no achievements for milestones like boss kills and you get kicked from the game during cut scenes. Who ever made the decision that the tower mode is single player only needs to get fired, let's lock hours of content behind a no friends allowed wall. \n\nGame doesn't get harder/progress/lacks content~ All the bosses (ONLY 5) use the same attacks and mechanics and only one boss doesn't use a circle to fight in. The end game final boss was such a disappointment, meanwhile the act 1 final boss was super good and the best boss in the game hands down as the other bosses are just you running and jumping in a circle for three minutes. Each act has 3 biomes and each biome only takes about one hour to beat assuming you clear every single room, which you don't have to do, meaning the game is less than ten hours long including the cut scenes. The counter to this is difficulty and mystery. If you or both of you die, you start over from the begging of that act. So if you've spent 3 hours on act 1 and lose to the final boss back to square one, unless you know how to do the revive mechanic and if you find it before death. The 10 weapons (four are grenade launchers) are very hit or miss, either love em or hate em. Why devs think locking fun behind a time gate is a good idea is baffling because the grappling hook just completely changes the game and opens many doors. Weapons are suppose to progress and get better the more you use them but I never felt that.\n\nPros: Visuals, environment and atmosphere are top notch but, in 2023 you have so many games that have done this it's not ground breaking. Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodbourne, Remnant, ect.\n\nCombat/Gameplay are very good and mostly smooth, dash locks you out of shooting and other actions and breaks the flow, grapple does too but that's fine. Melee can be hit or miss as sometimes the auto lunge misses. \n\nFull price is not worth it imo but go watch a little gameplay and if you like it and games like Remnant and Dark Souls you'll have fun, just know it's only for a few hours.",

I was constantly falling through the world which is annoying when you're having a good run, but it's still somewhat tolerable.  Then I just fell through the world and got stuck under the map.  I had nowhere to go except jumping off of a cliff and taking damage.  Before I died, I quit the game because I thought maybe reloading would help.  Well, now when I start up the game there is just a loading screen that never stops and I can't even get into the game now.  It is also too late to get a refund so my game is just bricked.",

        "review": "Top 3 Roguelikes of all time, not kidding. So glad to revisit this game on PC as I played the hell out of it on my PS5.\n\nIf you can run the game at its \"recommended\" settings, I can't stress enough how important this game is in your library, especially if you're into Roguelikes.\n\n- Visually stunning\n- Easy to follow, yet surprising and captivating story\n- Engaging and intense combat (If you have a PS5 controller, I highly recommend using it as it's much more immersive and has special interactions with the haptics of the triggers)\n- Enemy variety is plenty and keeps you on your toes (or off them depending on their attack)\n- Bosses are CRAZY. They will genuinely make your jaw drop, whether its from an attack, their arena, or design. They are FUN.\n- Online can be a real treat, but it's a bit harder to find people at times since it doesn't cross-play with PS5, it just crossplays with EGS players which I imagine are non-existent since the game is on Steam.\n- Optimization seems great. I've heard it wasn't so good at launch, but I've had 0 stutters and overall the game runs and plays excellently. Some frame drops due to more intense situations with bullets flying everywhere obviously, but that's not the game's fault at all.\n\nBuy this game. Now. I'm not asking.",

I do not think Returnal has quite the replay-ability commonly associated with the rogue-like genre, Risk of Rain 2 for example, but I personally prefer Returnal over most it's contemporaries.\n\nIt is a bit buggy though, I did not experience any along the lines of a memory leak, but the audio can cut out for a second here or there regularly. Once I needed to restart my computer in order to fix an issue where the audio for the game broke entirely; I didn't have any audio issues with any other games and restarting Returnal wasn't enough on it's own.\n\nI can strongly recommend this title despite any issues, but that's only if the game actually wants to work for your PC; considering how other people have experienced more serious issues, I really hope we see another patch at some point to polish this out.",

I understand the need for a challenge as far as gaming goes but this game does not deliver a challenge  with the opportunity to adapt or learn from mistakes. The changing of the environment every time you die, plus adding mini bosses to the same environment you have visited before that were not present previously, plus changing the mini bosses abilities and powers, from previously, plus adding two mini bosses to the environment instead of one, plus not keeping all power-ups permanently, plus losing weapons after you die, plus choosing good power-ups with a known or unknown defect, is not a very enjoyable game.\n\nThere is defiantly a niche of gamers that this will hit in a good way, but again . . . This is a niche! This is a game best suited to a scientific study on human behavior but not something to enjoy on a day off from work at home. Please try again Dev's, and make a more enjoyable game that involves actual challenges and not endless torture, we have enough Demon Souls and Dark Souls like games out there to do that for us.\n\n*UPADTE* I played the game for another 20 hours to see if perhaps I was too quick to judge. I stand by my initial review!",

        "review": "Honestly the game is far too unforgiving. I love almost everything about it, the weapons are fun, the world is great, the story is interesting so far...but when you finally get your build working, and have some great synergistic parasites, a high level weapon that you love, then you walk in to a boss room for your first time fighting something deliberately designed to be difficult only to be killed and sent back to the start of the game with basically nothing it's too disheartening.\n\nI get that it's a roguelike and that's part and parcel, but where this falls in comparison to others is that the time sink for each run is massive. Roguelikes actually want you to complete them as the real fun in them lies in completing them multiple ways, and changing your decisions to get more interesting results...but this is narrative game about a woman trapped in an endless cycle of torment and they want you to feel that. When the game pulls away from bullet hell and puts me in a house scared shitless at every sound and movement, I'm on the edge of my seat.\n\nThen I pick up some item and it puts my max HP at 50% then it puts me in a room with 8 octopus dogs flanking me from every direction and 6 jellyfish trying to ram in to me whilst a teleporting tree-man attaches me on the ground, and 4 turrets are blasting me from range and a big green pulse is healing everyone faster than I can damage them, then flashes \"LOCKDOWN IN PLACE\"...and I'm just like, where do I even start with this? And that's not to mention that I've already finished this level and I'm just trying to get back to the other areas to progress further.\n\nIf this game was a soulslike where I could take time getting the items I want and min-maxing my build, I'd happily bash my head against this wall over and over, but as it stands right now I'm not having any fun.",

But in addition to all the technical reasons why Returnal is an ongoing treat to play, the story that the game slowly feeds you is haunting, tragic, exciting, and mysterious. Every bit of new lore I get gives me a new clue as to WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE. Seriously - what the hell IS going on here? I need to know!\n\nI have half a dozen different theories at the moment, and any of them could fit. I need to find the next clue. I need to know what is happening to Selene. Who is she? WHAT is she? This game is not what it seems on the surface, and if you're a sucker for science fiction mystery and have the patience to find out for yourself, this is the game for you.",

If you liked any of their previous arcade games like Nex Machina, Resogun, or Super Stardust you'll probably like this. This is an arcade game at heart. Purely about the control and the audio/visual experience. It's not easy by any stretch but it's exciting and a hell of a lot of fun to play. I can't recommend it enough. I am biased however as I'm a huge Housemarque fanboy. I've played and enjoyed almost their entire catalogue of games. Bottom line: if you like challenging, arcade style games then you should absolutely give Returnal a chance.",

If you find that intriguing, I'd suggest save your money from gaming to spend on a shrink and some medication.\n\nI like the third person and controller support but graphics, gear, story, music/audio, the whole Rogue-like conceit, all really boring and second rate.

A must play for anyone who likes tight shooting mechanics and lot of movement. The worlds are beautifully designed and the random generation of each room encounter adds a new flavor every time you go through a run. \n\nMy only complain is that sometimes the game can really feel like its \"out to get you\". There are too many ways for the player character to be de-buffed and not enough pickups that really feel really powerful. The odds are always heavy stacked against you and with heavy penalties put on getting hit even once, the game can feel like a real soulslike game. \n\nIf you are up for the challenge, the gameplay loop is really enjoyable and addictive!",

Not much of a in depth story here but the game play makes up for it. I recommend playing this with Sony dual sense controller as the haptic feedback is very immersive in this title.",

I ended up playing longer than I thought and digging further each iteration without realizing how much better I'd gotten at the game's mechanics. The skill development system is rewarding enough that it feels natural, while still being challenging if you have a so-so roll on a run.\n\nAs for the story, I found it a good driving force without being too heavy in the gameplay loop. Again, the developers knew how to give just enough to balance multiple iterations without feeling grindy or stingy, to me. The community's discussion and unraveling of the story was also something I enjoyed; theories and discussions are something I like in a game's community and Returnal, again, delivers.\n\nAs I write this, I think it might be time for me to pick it up again and try to complete(?) the Tower to unlock a little more story.",

I fully enjoyed unlocking story pieces, and finding my way into things, finding random items, and searching for things I needed. Great integration of story and Art. Really a ton of content was put into this one.\n\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nI didn't like getting killed all the time - and I did - a lot... but, I guess that's the learning curve - I died a LOT playing Metroid Dread too...\n\nFor folks who don't appreciate hard games - this isn't for you. It's hard. \n\n",

There you discover signs of alien civilisations and get attacked by hostile creatures. The story is told mostly through audio logs you can collect. Funny thing is every time you die in the game you start from scratch and the world changes. You only get to keep a very few permanent upgrades when you start over.\nI must admit that the game is brutally challenging. I am yet to complete the first boss and I have already restarted over ten times already.\nPros: Story, Graphics, Audio, game play, replay ability.\nCons: Could have been better optimised. It runs fine on my PC, but still it stutters every time during the PlayStation logo cut scene every time I start the game. \n\nPC configuration: \n1) NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti 8 GB\n2) AMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n3) 32 GB of RAM\n4) 2 X 512 GB SSD and 2 TB HDD\n5) Resolution: 1920 X 1080\n6) Windows 11 Pro\n\nFPS Result at epic settings: 87 FPS (average with RT turned off)",

        "review": "Sadly this game is a wasted opportunity. There is lots to love about it but ultimately it doesn't come together into an enjoyable experience. \n\nHere's the deal: the core game play loop is very fun. The combat is awesome, I love the world as well, the story, the atmosphere are all done very well. \nBut, this is a rogue like, and these games are very difficult to design well. It's a balancing act where you have to make the player want to come back for \"just one more run\". Unfortunately I feel the opposite when I die and my run ends.  To be fair I don't normally like this genre, but I thought Hades did an amazing job with it where even I enjoyed it, and completed the game 10+ times to get the true ending.\n\nThere are a couple things that made that possible: in Hades once you figured out your play style and leveled up your character, you breezed through the early levels with ease, and so the run length was pretty much always around 30 minutes. It was more generous with permanent upgrades to make this possible. \nThis game is the opposite. On the one hand it does give you shortcuts to the later biomes, but if you go there you will die immediately because there are under powered. \nSo it makes you grind the early levels over and over and over again. Who thought this will be fun? I don't know what the balance fix would be, but they gotta do something where you can jump back in clean up the early sections real fast so it doesn't feel like a grind.\n\nAs it is, I might finish it if I got nothing better to do, the story would motivate me, but I am really not looking forward to the early level grind.",

I've put about 200 hours into the PS5 version so don't let the 9 hours of PC time mislead you.\n\nI'm happy to see, and say, that the PC port of this game is flawless. Housemarque have made a very special game and I'm glad it's not just PS5 players that are experiencing the adrenaline rush of taking down Nemesis with just a sliver of health left.\n\nIf you like third person shooters or fast paced gameplay, Returnal is going to blow you away.",

I didn't really see a reason to play this on PC, except today I was just having a good time playing PS games on steam, and thinking about whether or not I wanted to just go PC gaming, since it seemed like with a great PC, all these games were playing so well. The only downside is waiting for them to come to PC and get fixed.\n\nI think this game is much much better with mouse and keyboard. To me it feels like this game was meant to be played on pc that way. I guess that is very subjective, but this is my review, and I am sitting in a chair with no bubble gum in sight. \n\nI'm not going to talk about the game. If you like Housemarque games, this is another great one. I will emphasize that if you are wondering if M & K is making it better, it is. Also it runs much better if you have a good machine. I repeat myself, but I don't win or lose anything for these. Just hoping it helps someone have fun with this.",

Amazing storyline; tough but fair; rewards exploring after you've cleared each biome (so that weapons are max when you open boxes and healing items increase your health). Game blew my mind and how it ran so well on original Steam Deck (not the new OLED one). Steam Deck issues: it stuttered once really bad so I had to close/suspend. When I rebooted the game (didn't have to reboot Steam Deck), it worked fine. I suspended twice more just to make sure the fourth and fifth (sixth biome) boss didn't have any issues. Steam says this game isn't verified for Steam Deck BUT it worked fantastic for me :)",

The gameplay slaps, the music's great, the story is actually really complex and deep and gets you thinking if you let it, it's got such an incredible atmosphere with well crafted environments and hostiles and it has it's challenging moments. \n\nThat being said, like any rouge-lite, since it is primarily a story driven experience with a bit of replayability, the difficulty can start to drop off if you play more safe and as you learn enemies and the specific maps and weapon niches, etc. \n\nIf it is approached from a perspective of a re-playable story or even if you just really enjoy the mechanics and what kind of builds you can make and wish to level stuff fully to be a completionist, this game can easily last you quite a while. That isn't even including the sort-of-separate tower climb experience included also, oh and multiplayer shenanigans.\n\nOverall, so glad this game came to PC, as it was one that I always wanted to play and experience. I look forward to hopefully 100 percenting it soon!",

Returnal is not only a rogue like game we all know it has a very interesting story that leaves you wanting to know more after every run, the pace of the game is amazing and the aliens/monsters are very interesting. The visuals in the game are great as well there is so much detail and texture to the maps, they really bring out the dark mysterious vibe of the whole planet and it really adds to the feel of the story. One thing I will say is when you open the game get ready to sit down for a while the runs last a very long time once you get to know what you are doing, my longest run was about a hour and 70 mins. I most def recommend this game to people who love rogue like and a good story.  10/10",

Amazing mechanically, incredible mobility, percussive gun feel, stunning bullet hell bosses, all wrapped up in an addictive rouguelike structure. The endless Tower mode is also pure addictive adrenaline (if you just want to shoot things at a frenetic pace). Also incredible dualsense support. Pretty tough but very rewarding, flow-like gameplay. Housemarque's best game since Resogun.\n\nCan be a bit stuttery on my mid-range PC, but manageable.",

After 10 hours, I feel like I'm only halfway through the game, and I yearn for when I can play it again so I can get further into the story. Which was unexpected, as the gameplay enough was for me, but now there's a story in here I must learn about.\n\nRogue-likes can sometimes be a hit or miss with me, despite Rogue Legacy and Dead Cells being one of my favorite games, and the way this delivers their rogue-like is quite fascinating. I saw mods for this game that made the main character look like Samus Aran, and it does feel like a variation of Metroid in a way. Truly an enjoyable game, highly recommend, especially if you like rogue-like's.",

Though I had some problems with textures stopping to load properly after some time. A game restart was necessary in those cases.\n\nThe music is ominous and really well-fitting to the theme. The sounds are also really well integrated, from guns and monsters to splash effects of cracking slime eggs. The voice acting is also really great. You can feel the AAA budget here in all aspects.\n\nThe setting is dark, forboding, Eldritch-like, and really interesting. When I sank into the Abyss I really thought: \"How the hell could the atmosphere become even more  uneasy than before?\"\n\nThe story is fragmented (comparable to Dark Souls), vague, and ambigous to leave room for the players interpretation.\n\nThe weapons feel great with all their unlockable traits. The same gun can play vastly different with with different combinations of traits.\n\nThe replayability is high, especially to get the whole story, multiple playthroughs are necessary with collecting various items. Other rogue-lites like \"The Binding of Isaac\" still offer more replayability.\n\nThe third-person-shooter bullet-hell combination feels really good which is really highlighted in the bossfights. Those will ask alot of you at your first time, but I could beat practically all bosses the first time around.\n\nSo I'd rate the game as not too hardcode challenging.\n\nWith its DLC \"Tower of Ascension\" youg et even more action in more compact form, which adds even more fun to the mix.\n\nI highly recommend Returnal to you if you like Rogoue-lites or action-packed Third-Person shooters.",

Go play Sudoku or maybe hidden picture games and virtual slots are more your speed like my mom. \n\nPeople crying about performance have slow computers because they suck as human beings.  Probably Democrat types, or their parents are Democrats. If your parents are Democrats, I am sorry for you. You got dealt a bad hand.  However, you cannot play a PS5 level game on PS3 level hardware. Get a better computer you poor pathetic traitor to America.  I have a 3080Ti with an i7 13700k cpu and 32GB of 5600 DDR5 ram.  Runs smooth as butter synced at 60fps on 1080p with max setting and no DLSS, can almost run 4K at 60fps on max settings with DLSS.\n\nOne big thing to note, DISABLE STEAM INPUT if your controls go haywire like mine did. I finally find a game that I really enjoy and actually look forward to playing instead of just scanning my library for 10 minutes, admiring my collection but unable to settle on anything I want to spend my time playing, and then just end up watching porn and going to sleep, but then about 3 hours into the game all of a sudden my controls went totally haywire, jumping uncontrollable, camera and movement going totally nuts, especially with multiple enemies around...I was so bummed....Like my girlfriend dumped me for a Democrat...I could not even muster the energy to watch filthy degenerate porn for a couple of minutes...but then I figured out if I disable Steam input, it fixed the problem.  Now I can watch porn again and only feel bad afterward instead of before...  Which is how the universe is supposed to be.",

I was VERY hesitant of buying this game after reading the bad reviews about the textures and lagging. However, I figured if I ran in to this problem a lot if the first 1hr, I would just refund it. Luckily, this has not been the case and I am 11 hours in with no issues and not a single crash. Returnal is a fantastic rough like game with tons of replay value. If DOOM and God of War had a baby it would be this game if that means anything to anyone. If you can catch this game on sale for $30-40 that would be a great deal. Also, if you are worried about the having to download the EPIC launcher do not sweat it. You do NOT need a internet connection to play this game and can just block any outbound connections the client is trying to make with no impact on the game. \n\nOverall, this game is great due to the beautiful environments, voice acting, difficulty, replay value, and  just how high speeds/stakes it can be which is quite a rush.\n\nCompute specs\nCPU - AMD 5900X\nGPU - AMD 6900X\nRAM - 64GB\nStorage- M.2 SK hynix Platinum P41\nMonitor - 2k @160hz",

If you're worried about the gameplay, the gunplay is snappy and tight, the movement is exceptional, the visuals are gorgeous, and the world is dark, mysterious, and fascinating. \n\nTime wise, it took me ~23 hours to complete Act 3. I'm not an exceptional gamer, but I'm fairly experienced, so my time is probably a decent representation of the time you can expect the core story to take. There's also an endless mode, co-op, and online challenges with leaderboards, so there's a lot to sink your teeth into beyond the story.\n\nAnd now that you know, STOP READING REVIEWS AND PLAY THE GAME.",

I recommend getting it only on sale.\n\nSome of the bigger turnoffs for me were:\n\n* The first boss seems to be designed in a way that will give you way more trouble than later bosses and will only pad playtime.\n* Some skills that feel like they should be permanently unlocked are instead luck dependant items (enjoy having yellow portals you can't open because the upgrade will drop next level).\n* Similarly at least one key permanent upgrade is locked behind a door that depends on random key drops.\n* Act 2 ramps up encounters by just throwing more enemies with denser bullet patterns at you, doesn't do anything new\n* Melee attack can't hit certain enemies at melee range, because of crappy hitboxes\n* At least in my experience I got severe graphical bugs that force me to restart the game (screen turning permanently black after falling off a ledge or into water)\n* Using Parasites does not seem really worth it unless you have some extremely lucky combination of items.\n* Same for the malignancy mechanic, the risk is usually pointless, because normal drops are enough to finish the game.\n* Only a couple of weapons are worth using (late game hollowseeker usually beats everything)\n* One of the game endings is super easy to miss, and the payoff is not worth the effort it takes to get it.\n* Coop has the super annoying choice of not letting your coop partner wander too far, and you can block each other's way. The netcode is so-so.\n* Coop has strange rules regarding which items stay on the map for both players and which ones don't.\n* No coop in Tower of Sysyphus without modding the game.",

But...the sheer variety of weapon mods makes balance very tough. An excellent gun will even allow you to beat bosses whose movement sets you haven't worked out yet and therefore trivialise some encounters. Maybe there is an argument for less weapon variety like in Hades.\n\nSomehow these developers resisted the urge to put in 15 different intro logos and unnecessary sub menus.

I came for alien violence, and that's what I got.\n\nOnly issue is, like for everyone, the performance. The graphics are good but don't explain why this game is so poorly optimized, resource-wise. I imagine it could run a lot better. Bugs haven't been an issue for me... yet. It's really unacceptable that they can't get this thing to run on the Steam Deck.\n\nStill, I'm having a great time. Got in on sale for $40, but I'd wager it's worth full price if they ever fix the bugs and optimization. Play on controller with your best speakers/headphones to get the most of it.",

        "review": "Difficulty is way too uneven and wonky. So you randomly respawn after death, unlike all other souls likes though you cannot return to pick up any dropped goods. So when you die you're just f**ked. You'll be powering through enemies one after another until suddenly a red god enemy spawns and kills you without any challenge, literally there is no contest, a red enemy practically means game over, except for sometimes when for whatever reason they're just tough instead of godlike, but 75% of the time they take no damage and kill you in 3 hits with a series of undodgeable attacks because they're attacks are multi strike combos which do damage at ALL times when they are happening so there is no dodge 'opening' it's just a line of damage going through the play field. \n\nThe game is beautiful, in less than 2 hours I got multiple wonderful screen shots. There is the potential of a great game here, maybe if there's a sequel? Things really aren't well explained. After each death you have to skip the same meaningless intro videos, each time. You can't recover good stuff when you die it's just an instant f**k you which compounds with the fact that insta death bosses randomly spawn ensuring you will always lose and always restart. It's no wonder the character is so confused, you can't break the loop. You can never get ahead of the curve. It's a game that could be good but the developer was too focused on making it difficult and not focused enough on \"is this game mechanic fun?\"",

I encountered numerous bugs on my run, some of which my co-op partner also experienced:\n\n-Textures turning low-quality after a period of gameplay, despite being on High.\n-Collected items continuing to appear on map as if uncollected\n-Weapons and items not appearing for one player or the other\n-Spawning in to a room in the air, and falling until damaged, infinitely until dead\n\nAside from the last one, these aren't game-breaking, but they are incredibly annoying, and genuinely unacceptable.  These issues are not unique to me, multiple posts around the internet speak of the very same problems, particularly the texture quality drop over time.  Despite these issues, the game is still very fun, but due to them I strongly suggest you do not buy Returnal on PC.  Get it on PS5 if you have one, and if not, do without.  You deserve better for your money.",

Yes, it was quite challenging at first - but the brilliant gunplay, sound, atmosphere, graphics and haptics (if you are using a dual sense), kept me going. The gameplay loop is just awesome, and the RNG elements are perfect and keep you coming back.\n\nOnce it clicks, and you begin to upgrade weapons, it becomes a whole lot of fun. I beat the game weeks ago, but continue to play more than any other game. Replay-ability is off the charts because it's so damn satisfying. In addition to the 61 hours I've put in on PC, I've also played for 40 hours on PS5. I have never played a single game for over 100 hours, until Returnal.",

There is a decent sized suite of weapons to experiment with, each with unique modifiers that meaningfully change up how you approach areas. In addition to weapons, there are also [i]a lot[/i] of other modifiers in the form of artifacts (passive upgrades) and parasites (one good effect and one bad). Playing hard into risk vs reward kept each run interesting.\n\nEvery region you fight through has an impressive amount of detail and they all look really good. The same is true for the enemies and especially the region bosses. The boss of Biome 4 is particularly cool.\n\nSound design is incredible. It's not something I normally pay that much attention to, but it was too good to ignore here. Everything just sounds right.\n\nThe git gud is real here though. This was definitely one of the most git guddinest games I've gotten gud at.\n\n[b][u]Highly recommended.[/u][/b]",

        "review": "First found this game after watching the Jacob Geller video, which mentioned that at the time that it was recorded, very few had actually passed the first level. You can absolutely assume I took that as a challenge.\n\nThat was a mistake. Among my friends, I am known as a masochist. Instead of attempting to break these habits, I decided to harness our mutual enjoyment of my (overly dramatic) suffering. \n\nThen the gameplay loop kicked in. Each weapon feels responsive, and they all have their own perks and drawbacks. Strategies need to be tweaked and sometimes scrapped. I have to remember to pick up\n\n~THAT_DAMNED_ASTRONAUT~\n\nConstantly going through the ringer again and again, I find myself fighting bosses with knowledge I wouldn't have if not for all the other failed attempts. Trial and error. What works and what doesn't. How to do it again, but faster and better. Perfection while eternally seeking rest and penance. Selene can't escape, but she might as well try.\n\nThe story, while on the backburner on account of spoilers within Geller's deep dive, absolutely encapsulates my favorite type of time loop-everything changes but you. Selene's personal hellscape and its symbolism-hidden under completions and encounters with an Apollo-era astronaut that haunts her-along with elements of her home world merging with Atropos grip tightly, and ensnare the player with an adamant decree that every single element of potential lore and subtext be analyzed and every single Greek term and name be traced and researched in an effort to leave the changing planet.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I have not finished the game. Hell, I don't even have a completed run. But I remain adamant, and, after having taken a good break and returning as of this review, I have faith that I can beat the loop, even if it is ultimately futile. Even in death, you are not free. You should still try, however.\n\nDon't fear the Reaper.",

        "review": "In the cosmic abyss, where dimensions intertwine and reality splinters, a lone astronaut named Selene found herself stranded on a desolate planet. The alien landscape seemed to writhe and pulsate with an unfathomable energy, as if the very fabric of existence quivered under the weight of the unknown. Selene's mind, fraught with doubt and disorientation, questioned the veracity of her surroundings, for the shifting terrain seemed to defy the laws of physics she had long held sacrosanct.\n\nAs she traversed the eerie topography, she perceived grotesque, amorphous shapes that slithered through the ethereal mist, their shadows elongating unnaturally as they pursued her with a sinister intent. The celestial bodies above, with their eldritch luminosity, cast a ghastly glow upon the land, revealing spectral ruins that hinted at an ancient, malevolent civilization long lost to time.\n\nHer senses became ensnared by an otherworldly chant that echoed through the alien winds, whispering secrets of forgotten love and abominable truths that threatened to unravel her sanity...\n\nDash - Jump - Die - Repeat\n",

It has an insanely good story, the gameplay loop is very good and it has very smooth and responsive shooting mechanics and controls in general.\nI don't care about the epic games thing that launches in the background, I had no crashes and I had consistent 144fps throughout my 88h of playing this game.\nThe mystery element of this game is awesome and I wish more games would do it like Returnal did.\nThe music and soundeffects of this game fit the atmosphere really well too.\nOverall this was a phenomenal gaming experience and I can't recommend this game enough.",

Cryptic and eerie story line with an AMAZING mid point. Embracing audio library and sound. Some of the coolest boss fights I have ever played.  \n\nCons:\nAbout 25% too much open space and or backtracking. Multiplayer connection issues. Finding the house 5+ times.",

Although there are deeper themes in the game that might require a bit of outside searching to really understand, you get the gist of what is going on slowly but surely. \n\nThe environments are oftentimes ornate and creepy, featuring a mix of Giger-esque themes and some aethetics I would expect from a Zdzisław Beksiński painting. The visuals in general are quite stunning, and the worlds are pretty large - but you also will traverse them quite quickly.\n\nFor gameplay, it is intense. It has great dodge mechanics - both on ground and mid-air - plus excellent maneuverability. You'll need that for constant dodging of brilliant neon projectiles while shooting at their sources. I used a PS4 controller and it worked great for this game. You can also put together somewhat different builds depending on the weapons and accessories you pick up, but you should be ready to toss those for better things that come along - and they do get dropped often enough to make you consider switching.\n\nThere is also a game mode that is a sort of endless gauntlet that you can play. There are people out there that have gotten to Phase 18 and beyond on it, but I've never gotten far past phase 3. >_> Still, there are some story items you can unlock by just replaying those initial few levels/phases, so there is reason to do the gauntlet that goes beyond just challenge.\n\nI'm not sure I have much to critique. The only thing that comes to mind is that although the main campaign's maps are relatively randomly generated, there is a bit of samey-ness or overlap between the first three areas and the last three areas.. or at least areas 1&2 with 4&5. It is intended for story reasons, but I do wish things differed a bit more.\n\nWhen I saw trailers for this game, it seriously made me consider getting a PS5. Since there wasn't much else on that system that I couldn't already access via PC, I am *very* glad it was eventually ported to PC.",

While growing up, I found it more and more difficult to be really impressed by a new video game, Returnal managed to accomplish this task.\nIt has a strong arcade component which sometimes can become frustrating because in order to progress in the game you need to complete certain areas without dying, and if you do you have to start again from the beginning. But I found the gameplay to be compelling and fun and for me it was truly rewarding to manage to go further.\nBesides that, the lore is extraordinary. I both loved how you discover it, which partly depends on how much you are willing to explore, and the meaning it gives to the game itself.\nI would totally recommend to play this game.",

Gameplay is excellent and captures the style, action, and adrenaline usually reserved for pre-rendered trailers. The shining jewel in the crown is the boss fights, easily some of the best I've ever experienced.\n\nWhat caused me to quit was the difficulty, which exists not so much as a slope but a steep staircase. The penultimate step proved too much and I threw in the towel. But those with more dedication (and more importantly time) will likely be able to adapt and overcome.",

Most cut scenes soft lock the game including when you have to re-spawn causing you to have to close and reload the game multiple times just for the chance it will allow you in. Of the 3 minutes I actually spent playing the game it seemed interesting, but considering the forums for this game show many posts even recent to the day I write this review of the same issue and for \"solutions\" for it on top of other inexcusable issues that seem to be rampant not only in my own experience but across board. If I spend more than half an hour to try to get your game to play AND I had to pay $60 for the waste of time the game could be amazing but it is no where near worth the hassle. If you want a game that runs well and is pretty similar just buy Remnant 2.",

Really nice implementation of movement, great fights, very interesting storyline, nice looking surroundings and enemies. I did quite often COOP, and yes, it has its flaws, nevertheless it was a ton of fun. Very rarely, in a game, I had that much fun although dying a lot (116 times by now). A game I love to come back to every now and then.\n\nThanks a lot for that very nicely done game.\n\nHave a nice day",

FAR AS IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY. \nno dolby atmos, no auro, no nothing can compare to ps5 tempest. not sure why. PC should be able to do the same, but perhaps the algorithm was never truly ported to pc. \ni refund the game mainly because of the sound. this is the only game that really used 3d sound. anything else is just a lie.\nand the fact that i already had this game. the first game i bought for ps5 when it came out",

The music is powerful and haunting, the perfect soundtrack to frantically blast your way through waves of aliens while maneuvering deftly past streams of radiant projectiles. The mobility and gunplay are perfect for me - my keyboard and mouse seamlessly controlled Selene. Never once did I feel out of sync with the game, a perfect flow. The boss fights are hypnotizing, both calming and engaging. There aren't really any cheap one-shot mechanics, you just learn the moves and weave back forth all the while unleashing hell at some giant emotionless, alien god. There is one boss in particular that will burn itself into your brain. I won't spoil anything here but the buildup and showdown is just something I can't forget. Housemarque really made something magical. I joke with my friends, this game is what it feels like to chew 5 gum.\n\nThere is a story here, too. Something dark and tragic. It's never outright explained, but it left it's impression on me. I can still hear Selene remarking \"Abandoning Helios\" every time a brand new run starts. To me it's a sad game, victory is fleeting and you are alone, fighting an endless battle.\n\nI believe the game is worth the $60 asking price, but I did buy it on sale for around $47.\n\n[spoiler]Don't Fear the Reaper was already a great song, but having it be a recurring theme in this game was such a welcome surprise. I can't help but be taken back to the ruins of Atropos whenever I hear it.[/spoiler]",

        "review": "Returnal. Is a great game, and I absolutely recommend it.\n\nFor my roguelite enthusiasts, I'll put it this way. Imagine a AAA game built loosely around the Commando and their kit from Risk of Rain 2. Give the bosses Dark Souls levels of difficulty. String the areas together as if it were an action RPG. Boom. That'll get your mind pretty close to how Returnal plays, and man, it is fun.\n\nOne reason to enjoy it: The gameplay is so tight and refined. I played on a PS5 controller and thought that might impair how I normally play with M&K but it didn't. Guns feel impactful and all the while the music increases in intensity as the tension rises, as you attempt to clear rooms and waves of enemies without taking damage. It creates amazing spectacle encounters in every room and can often make you feel the pressure of your potential demise. Sure, there are still times you can live out your power fantasy (as roguelites tend to let you do), as an unkillable god-being, but it's these intense runs facing death itself that make your spontaneous god-runs feel oh so satisfying.\n\nThe other part about Returnal that really made me fall in love with it is the mystery. The more you play the more you (think you) understand. You'll find glyphs in your run and slowly translate them into strange little conundrums. You'll find ruins of civilization and strange creatures inhabiting this odd world. Death is a part of the lore as well, so you're trying to understand the time loop. Just when you think you understand this game it gives you a well-earned reveal that changes your entire perspective. Not everything is as it seems. The twists in here go harder than freakin' Shamylan and I lived for them. I wish I could share more, but it's just best if you find these glorious moments yourself... and trust me. Understanding more about the game will just cheapen the experience. It is a wild and exceptionally good ride.\n\nThat being said there is more for me to experience in Returnal that I have not experienced quite yet (2023 has been unpredictably amazing in terms of releases which has pressed me for time), but I don't think completing these will change my opinion. I certainly intend to return (heh) soon of course. They can't just tout a \"true ending\" without me finding it. But just know my marked 21 hours isn't the reaaal end of the game.\n\nI imagine most will complete the campaign in about 25 or so hours, and on top of that, you have the endless mode which is incredibly satisfying as well. Capitalizes on the speed and thrill of combat without the travel time that can make the \"metroid-ing\" around the campaign a little tiresome from moment to moment. Also has its own conundrum of a narrative it follows, which is quite cool. Aside, but co-op was something I wanted to try, but never got around to. Would probably be fun.\n\nAs far as some lower notes go: Ran into one unavoidable bug that is 100% replicatable and happens every time (I posted about it in community forums and their website). Not the greatest PC port in general really. It worked for me way better than other reviewers but YMMV. I also... had a difficult time with the time allotment this game presents itself with. What I mean by that is... If I'm not sure I'll be gaming uninterrupted for like 2 hours I won't even bother to turn on Returnal paha. You can save and quit during a run at any time... but every time I do that in other roguelites I come back and die, so I'm incentivized per my own experiences to play one run all the way through to completion. Returnal is VAST. Runs can take hours. If you're stingy like me on saving and quitting you'll find it a bit difficult in that way as well.\n\nBut overall this is such an awesome game, with so many incredible high notes. The gameplay and progression feel great, the narrative mystery is excellent, and the presentation is absolutely top-notch. Because of the bugs and the lack of support on PC, it would be wise to wait for it to go on a bit of a deeper sale, but seriously, if you're looking for your next roguelite fix, I'm telling you right now, Returnal is a game you're not going to want to miss.",

It's pretty damn perfect for me.\n\nIt's also visually stunning.\n\nIt intrigues you, then slowly unravels a psychologically dreadful, infinite hell. That's all I will want to say.",

Mechanic works a lot like any souls game, if you don't dodge when it matters, you are punished. \n\nHere's some of the schmoo that doesn't make sense, dodge is trash in a dodge important game, and often an enemy or enemies can barrage you with so much heatseaking attacks you have ZERO CHOICE but to get hit.....which then drops your adrenaline which you need in this game to be effective.\n\nThe bosses (specifically the 3rd)are an absolute meme. First two, okay, a challenge.......then the third boss mechanically is a fucking nightmare? So he shits an absolute line of bullets at you the whole match where they are moments you can't control....idk FALLING? IDK GRAPPLING? Idk, someone dropped the ball in design overall. Sorry you made a unfun game but plenty of people with SYD and claim its awesomeness when it's just simply not an absolute turd.",

All settings are Low, but it runs and plays great, looks decent enough, and only had minor hitching maaaybe two times for a few seconds. \n\nGame is a nice blend of shoot n dodge bullet action, metroidvania exploration, and story you uncover as you go. It’s bullet hell here and there for firing patterns to dodge, but it’s manageable and not murderously difficult. You get a dodge that lets you pass through bullets like Nex Machina, so fights are fast-paced and fun. You can focus aim if you want, or you can just stay zoomed out to run and shoot and see more of the environment.\n\nPew pew pew good times exploring a weird alien world and maybe learning a thing or two about yourself along the way as you die and keep coming back.",

It is hard, challenging and Fun! I was shocked, and didnt think i would like it, but it truly is spectacular.  The Graphics are really nice, action is superb and the creepiness of it all really haunts you to the core....especially in the house.",

        "review": "Returnal is a third person shooter which has roguelite mechanics. The player controls astronaut Selene Vassos who is trapped in a time loop after her shuttle crash landed on a strange alien planet.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n•\tCombat is fast paced, and features enemies whose bullet hell style attacks will often flood the screen with energy projectiles, which means you need to be constantly moving to avoid taking damage. To help with this you have a dash move, which if timed correctly will let you pass safely through projectiles. And later in the game you’ll acquire a grappling hook which can attach to specific locations in the environment. While primarily designed to let you cross large gaps and reach high ledges, its also really useful for quickly avoiding nearby enemies.\n\n•\tWhen you die, you’ll return to the crash site at the start of the game and lose most of the weapons and upgrades you’d collected during the previous run. However, you’ll keep important story items, and you can unlock shortcuts back to later areas, so its not too punishing. You’ll find healing items regularly, and there are a couple of items which give you an extra life to extend that run.\n\n•\tEach time you start a new run, the world will have a partially randomised layout. Each individual room has a fixed layout, but they’ll be connected together in a different order, and will contain different enemies, weapons and items.\n\n•\tYour journey will take you from a jungle to a desert, a stone city, a frozen wasteland, and a deep underwater abyss. You’ll encounter hostile wildlife resembling big cats and squids (both have lots of tentacles), aggressive plants, robots, flying drones, sentry turrets and massive bosses with multiple health bars and attack stages.\n\n•\tThe weapons you can use all have fancy sci-fi names, but effectively there’s a pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, grenade launcher and a couple of assault rifles. Each weapon has an alternate fire special attack which operates on a cooldown, and you can unlock extra passive abilities such as homing projectiles or bullets that heal you based on damage dealt to enemies. You can also use a sword for close range melee attacks and to break enemy shields.\n\n•\tMy one complaint about the combat is that you can only carry one gun at a time. Most areas have wide open spaces, which means in most situations I want rapid fire weapons that are accurate at long range, so I usually ignore everything except the 2 assault rifles. The other weapons are only useful in specific situations, so if I can’t switch between different weapons, I’ll never take those other weapons.\n\n•\tThere are several risk/reward mechanics. You can attach parasites to your body which will give you a positive and negative perk, for example heal every time you kill an enemy, but you can no longer use medkits. You’ll find chests which could contain a useful item, but also have a chance to give you a negative perk. And you’ll enter trap rooms where tempting items are placed in the middle of laser traps or on the other side of bottomless pits where you’ll need to navigate small platforms.\n\n•\tCombat can be very challenging at times, and it wasn’t just the bosses that gave me problems. Sometimes I’d encounter a particularly annoying group of enemies in a room that didn’t have much cover, or there would be so many enemies and projectiles on screen that I couldn’t keep track of everything. However, I made some kind of permanent progress every few attempts, and finally defeating an enemy who had previously killed me multiple times felt great.\n\n•\tIt took me around 20 hours to complete the main story, and in addition to this there’s an endless mode where Selene must climb the “Tower of Sisyphus” one floor at a time, fighting waves of enemies along the way.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\n•\tStory is interesting, and there are plenty of hints that things are not exactly as they seem, but it ends just when we’re starting to get answers about what is happening.\n\n•\tStory is mostly told through audio logs and a few flashback cutscenes. Voice acting is quite good.\n\n[h1]Technical[/h1]\n\n•\tControls are fully rebindable and the combat feels great with mouse and keyboard.\n\n•\tPerformance is excellent. I have a very smooth framerate at 1440p with all settings maxed except ray tracing which is on medium.\n\n•\tThere’s a very useful benchmark which shows what effect each setting has on CPU and GPU load. I wish every AAA game would include something like this.\n\n•\tI’ve crashed twice, but haven’t encountered any other bugs.\n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\n\nReturnal is an excellent game, and is definitely a must play for fans of shooters. You might want to wait for a small sale due to the length of the game.",

Things that should be permanent are not, and things that are temporary, like currency, are meaningless in the amounts you can gather them anyway. Just makes you repeat the same actions over and over. \n\nThis game is a Grind-like, not a rogue-like.",

Even though I was scared multiple times, I was overall gripped by the secrets and the story of Selene, the main character.\n\nThe only issues I encountered while playing were that every cutscene had audio desync and few hectic moments of the game had frame drops. The cutscenes were the worst part since I ended up skipping most of them and actually watching them on youtube as I was making progress. I was not the only person to have this issue, but I couldn't seem to find a solution online.",

It feels very solid, and is an excellent benchmark for testing new hardware, with trance-like gameplay if you let it.",

        "review": "So glad this finally made its way to PC, because it is fantastic. There is the usual UE issues, but my biggest issue was Memory Compression killing my framerate. I upgraded from 32GB to 64GB and then was able to use powershell to disable memory compression in Windows and my performance skyrocketed. Seriously wish I knew about that beforehand, but once that was sorted, I had no complaints. This game has such great systems in place for you to really sink into. The guns all have pros and cons (Electropylon Driver all day for me) but the risk/reward system is just so addictive. The story is great too, not too overt, not too abstract, just a really good scifi tale that you learn more of the more you look. It's not like a FromSoft where you have to read essays in every description too, they actually have lore that plays out, as well as can be read. It's really just so well balanced that I have to say that it is one of my favorites of the past few years.",

        "review": "If you are interested in this as a roguelike I would say it's not really worth. You can't really build up unique runs by combining items and status effects. It's more about building up health and finding higher level weapons. From there it's rinse and repeat since you more or less get the same items every run. Some items can help this out and make a pretty big difference in that respect, but I never really found any items that made the game play any differently. Some of the weapons have cool and unique mechanics but in all honestly they don't change up the game enough for it to really matter. Runs can easily be 5-6 hours long and without any promise of cool builds, combining artifacts for an OP run, or something of the sort, the game started to feel really miserable. Because of this once you have a completed run there isn't really any reason to play it again imo.\n\nIt's not incredibly hard, but definitely challenging enough for the average person. The game is beautiful, the base mechanics are really fun and fluid, and the story is solid enough. Also I gotta give it up, the bosses are all really fun and interesting. They each have their own thing going on, not super difficult, but definitely challenging and fun. However performance is not great. Even with a 3080 and a 5950x there were some rooms where the frames were just awful. The game relies super heavily on timing and in crowded rooms the frame drops can be a real problem. I more than once found myself 2-3 hours into a run, entered a crowded room, and instantly dropped to 30 fps. When you're that deep into a run, dying to the game not performing well is super aggravating.\n\n*SPOLIERS*\n\nOnce you are in act two the balancing just goes out the window. I have had two runs that start in act two and the second room is a mini boss room. It's definitely beatable but starting a run off, having no items, and immediately being 1hp is just not fun. The ability to skip bosses both helps and hurts the game, in act one it was such a relief being able to get back to where I was in about 10-15 minutes, kept it fun for me. However because of this mechanic I never fought any of the bosses more than once. The risk vs reward system was really fumbled imo. Much like risk of rain 2 with lunar items, most items have a good and bad effect attached to them. However in this game the good very rarely out weighs the bad. Some of the chests can trigger waves of enemies in an already cleared room, and then the item you get is most of the time not worth picking up as the negative status effects would kill the run. Some chest are \"malignant\" but they come with the promise of \"very valuable items\". So you have to either clean the chest with 3-5 ether which in the early game is sometimes a lot, or you take a negative status effect and even then the items in the chest can be things that you are able to find on the ground at no cost. Additionally some of those chests also require a key that if used on a chest may it may prevent you from accessing rooms later in the run. It just feels like a big \"fuck you\" if you invest that much into getting item and then it's not worth picking up or it's something the game already gives you for free. Very often led to me not risking anything.\n\nOverall I would say the game is really cool, but it wasn't very fun, for me.",

        "review": "Well, I bought this game tempted by positive comments and nice trailers. Unfortunately, I quickly learned that this game is simply over hyped. The most important problem with this game is its concept. You go over randomly generated map, killing monsters (easy and boring), gaining weapon skill points from killing them, gathering some upgrades and a kind of currency to buy items and upgrades in special machines. These are all required for you to have a chance to defeat a boss. And killing a boss is of course required to progress to the next stage of the game. It typically takes you minimum an hour or two to grind and reach to the boss. The boss kills you. You have to start again. You loose all the skill points, currency and upgrades which you gathered. So you explore the map, kill the same type of boring enemies, grind the same resources and items. You thing it goes well that time. Then suddenly the game throws you powerful enemy on your face and locks you in limited space. You dies. You need to start from scratch again. After a few hours of repeating these boring activities, you might finally defeat the first boss. You think it is great. Then you will die somewhere on the second stage (and there are plenty occasions for that). And guess what? You need to start from the beginning. Or the second boss will kill you. And you will start form scratch again. This concept of dying and resurrecting was funny maybe 4-5 times, because with each iteration I was able to find or learn something new. After that there is nothing new to explore or to learn. The same enemies, the same weapons (there are only 5 or 6 types in the game, so don't expect too much), the same items. Map layout changes every time, but that's all, still many areas and rooms are repeatable just placed in random order. You cannot save. You cannot lower difficulty. You can only start again from the beginning with a hope that after 2 hours of grinding and killing boring enemies, you will finally manage to defeat extremely powerful boss. But if you won't? Sorry, you die, you start from scratch again. After a few tries when I learned that this is too boring to continue, I found a way to make a backup of local save files and restore them. Then I learned why this concept of perma death exist. Without it, you will be likely able to complete the game in less than 10 hours and the story is so thin... I really wanted to like this game. But it did not allow me that in any way. If you like doing boring stuff again and again, go on with that game. I don't, so I gave up with this. There are plenty more interesting games or things to do rather than wasting my time like that.",

Its like if you mixed Risk of Rain, and Remnant. \n\nHowever the biggest and only issue i have with this game is every launch, it tries to install the Epic launcher. Idk if theres a way to disable that or not but Epic is absolute dogshit and theres no possible way i will ever allow it to be installed on my computer.",

        "review": "Returnal is a great game flawed by its not-so-great performance (optimisation).\n\nI have to mention the performance as I don’t believe the game is that well optimised. I couldn’t run the game consistently at 100 FPS at a 1080p resolution with an RTX 2080 even on Low Settings (with DLSS enabled). The game would frequently stutter (drop to 70 FPS even when areas are empty of enemies) and I couldn’t find how to best fix that online. There were a few options to turn this or that thing off on your computer but no one explained how that would affect anything else (like other games or applications) so I dared to not try. So what I did was enable V-sync and played at 60 FPS. Even then the game would sometimes chop a few frames here and there but there were very few times where I felt noticeable stuttering.\n\nSo, if you’re comfortable playing at 60 frames (with 2080 or low end GPU) at 1080p, then you should definitely consider picking it up as this is a great roguelike.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and responsive. The enemy variety was good but not amazing. For 10 hours it was great but after that the monsters overstayed their welcome. Same goes for the arenas.\n\nThere’s a bunch of weapons to master and play with. Biomes, collectibles, secrets - it’s all there for you to explore and unlock.\n\nThe game setting and soundtrack are great. Returnal does feel like a love letter to the “Alien” movie with a roguelike twist on it and mythology influence.\n\nAs for the story - it’s good. It does leave you wondering after the first playthrough and I love those kinds of games that you talk and think about after you finish them.\n\nOverall - great game but a better optimisation would have been great.",

It's a rogue-like with a complex story that I don't fully understand, but it's way fun and super good. I played it for a while and had a ton of fun, but it's hard to come back to for replay ability because it's pretty poorly optimized for pc. No matter what graphics setting I set it to, it stutters in the same locations. I know my pc is pretty average as far as performance, but no other game I have runs like this so that would be what I understand. Definitely recommend this game, but I'd buy it on the ps5 if you have one until they either fix the optimization.",

        "review": "Returnal is a seriously good game. Every 10 minutes while playing this I picked up on some new clever mechanic, or was engrossed further in it plot, or came across an unexpected discovery. The entire run time I was totally glued to the screen. It really does nail almost everything - Story, music, gameplay, graphics, acting, etc. My biggest complaint is probably that once I 'got it' I flew through the whole game in one super clean run with little challenge; for the game's notorious reputation for being challenging, that was pretty disappointing.  To be clear, the balance is really good, where things are stressful and make you work for it, but it feels pretty fair, and the pacing is nice with good down time, but I kinda wanted something a little more challenging than what I ultimately played. In the end, though, I can't recommend this game enough for those of you that like deep mechanics, numbers, and reaction-based games.\n\nP.S. I also want to add, though not really relevant to the game itself, that this is an excellent port; probably one of the best out there. Ran like butter, a huge number of graphics, UI, audio, and accessibility options. Just a wonderful way to bring this to PC players.\n\nP.P.S. It would be really killer if we could get this running on the Deck.",

Try the elite monsters that randomly spawn in some rooms, I died about 10 times total to all major act bosses combined this game, while there were times where i couldn't get out of act 4 for 2 hours straight because the elites kept deleting me in one of the first rooms\n\nSo wait, I just wrote an essay complaining how bad this game is, why is this a positive review: The core gameplay is just really fun, which is kinda the most important thing in a game like this. \n\nThis is not a roguelike you can play for a very long time, by the time you are done with the story you will most likely become bored because there is so little variation, the story itself drops the ball really hard and the technical state is insulting, but as a purely gameplay focused single player title this game absolutely delivers a solid amount of fun for your money.\n\nAlso if you're playing this with KBM controls, the game difficulty is way overstated by everyone; don't get me wrong, this isn't a cakewalk, but if you don't intentionally summon the murdertrains that are the online only dead scout elite mobs, you won't have any trouble clearing this since its very obvious the difficulty was not tuned with the aim and mobility of a mouse in mind.",

I wasn’t sure if I would like the bullet hell aspect of the game but when you get in a rhythm and know the move sets the game is fantastic fun. The game rewards you constantly and it feels like you are building Selene up to be a badass.\n\nThe game runs well although it does stutter when transitioning to a new area. I also haven’t encountered any bugs while playing so far.\n\nI love the story; it was unexpected the direction it went in but made the journey feel more meaningful. The music complements the fights and environments beautifully. I kept wanting to come back for more. After beating the game I still have so much fun replaying to find every item and entry. Returnal is enthralling and I highly recommend people give it a go.",

I found the narrative very enjoyable, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea, with a mixture of psychologic and cosmic horror told in a post-modern, open-ended way, with themes of grief, trauma and motherhood. Aesthetically, it shows the DNA of the Alien series, with dark Gigeresque structures, monsters that are masses of writhing tentacles.\n\nDifficulty wise, I thought it was adequate. It's a challenging game, but it gives you multiple incentives for getting good at it, with the integrity and adrenaline systems rewarding players who dodge effectively.\n\nI found a few visual glitches and had some issues with frame stuttering, but nothing gamebreaking or that would take from the experience.

Took only 7 hours to complete which is sad especially for a roguelite. Granted, I don't have all of the achievements but the gameplay is simply not exciting enough to incentivize me to do it. There's only 3 guns even worth using at all, and while the rest of them are interesting concepts they have very little incentive to use them by the time I have already unlocked the carbine in the first area. I thought I was going to get another great shooter roguelite like ror2 or synthetik but instead I got a gimmicky and short game with bad replayability for all of my 50 dollars.",

The gameplay, presentation, and atmosphere are all top-notch, but the game can also be polarizing and evoke strong love/hate reactions. It’s absolutely disheartening to have a long run come to an abrupt end due to a random overpowered monster spawning and ending your progress within seconds, just because you happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even though I’m not very good at the game, I still give it a thumbs up. Just because I struggle with it doesn’t mean it’s bad. Would I recommend this? Well, I’m a bit hesitant, as opinions on this game can vary greatly.",

I was hoping that was just a matter of getting good, but even if you had any way of getting good, you would have no growth cycle by cycle.

Every level ends in a boss fight, after which you teleport to a new location. Item logs talk of creators, demiurge entities and crazy alien lore.\n\nOr not... who knows at this point.\n\nGunplay is good, good variety of weapons although some seem very obviously suboptimal... maybe I am holding them wrong.\nThe bullet-hell mechanic is very hectic and not always legible, particularly in the first dark and wet levels.\n\nEither way a very engaging game and worth a sale purchase.",

        "review": "I just finished the \"true\" ending of Act 3, and I have to say, Returnal has been one of the most intriguing, immersive, and white-knuckled gaming experiences I have had in some time. At a surface level, it almost feels like playing a darker roguelite version of Metroid Prime as you explore haunting regions across a broken alien planet. Look a little deeper, and you also have a tense and gripping narrative that explores themes of loss, trauma, and guilt.\n\nI don't want to gush about the game for too long, as the positives of Returnal have been covered well enough by now, given that it was a AAA launch title for the PS5. I do have to give a special shout-out to the art direction and sound design, though; I don't think I've ever seen a more unsettling, rich, and enrapturing world in any other game. Each zone is absolutely beautiful, brimming with a sense of foreboding mystery; the developers have done an astoundingly excellent job at creating what feels like a real world, with a real alien society, that you explore the ruins of. Atropos is so engrossing and engaging that I just want to spend time exploring the gorgeous landscapes. Props must be given to the Abyssal Scar --one of the coolest zones in any game ever-- as well as the Crimson Wastes and Derelict Citadel for their sense of depth, breadth, and history. Truly, Returnal transports you to another world, and a system of Metroidvania-esque permanent unlockables adds a dynamic of unfolding exploration throughout the game's runtime. This is all supported by tense, horror-style narrative sequences that add emotional heft and context to the expanding scope and drama of the world.\n\nOf course, the gameplay itself is tight, with a plethora of destructive tools and evasive maneuvers at your disposable, as well as a wealth of unlockable artifacts and consumables. The item system doesn't go quite as deep as something like Risk of Rain 2, but there are cool passives to be found and some interesting synergies to be assembled, even if it doesn't appear like it at first. Aside from items, the flagship in-run progression system is weapons: more specifically, traits and stats, which are two genius systems that work together to enable nearly infinite iterations of the already-fantastic base weapons in Returnal. Every weapon drop is a chance for analysis and decision-making as you assess each new, randomly-generated gun. And, for the ultimate risk-reward decision-making, corrupted \"Malignant\" items, currency, and health pickups will taunt you throughout your run, challenging you to take risks as you try and scrape together every bit of power you can.\n\nI'd also be remiss not to mention the Tower of Sisyphus - this is an extraordinarily good addition to the base campaign worthy of its own review. I often split up my \"core\" game runs with Tower runs - while they don't quite have the atmospheric immersion and deep narrative of the \"standard\" runs across Act I/II zones, they offer a lightning-paced combat romp that captures the arcade-like sense of action and progression the roguelite genre is known for. It really shows off how great the core gameplay of Returnal is: laid bare, the combat shines as some of the best in the genre (and of any bullet-hell or third-person shooter, for that matter). And, all that being said, there still are intriguing, unsettling pieces of the narrative to uncover throughout the Tower, and these perfectly complement the primary story of a \"normal\" run. While I have plenty of unlockables to get from the main game, I foresee myself spending many hours in the Tower of Sisyphus, pushing myself to see just how high a score I can get.\n\nAll this is to say, Returnal is a truly special game well worth your time and money. I was hooked immediately when I started playing and had a feeling it may become one of my all-time favorite games; now, It's firmly settled in a top 3 spot, if not higher! I have immensely enjoyed my time with the game, and I really believe it shows what games are capable of as an art form: entertaining, exciting action; deep, multi-sensory immersion; and complex, satisfying storytelling. Returnal is one of those rare games where the gameplay mechanics support the narrative and vice versa: everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is working together in Returnal, and it's working together splendidly. I could not recommend this game more highly: it is a definitive gaming experience worth a place in every person's library.",

Difficult to describe how the rogue-like elements of the game stem from the story, but it's done far better than any other rogue-like I've played, including RoR2. I would say that RoR2 has more gameplay variety, but Returnal has a more immersive atmosphere and gameplay loop. I can't say more without spoiling things.",

The end game gets incredibly buggy and leggy as you progress further up the tower, there is stuttering quite often on dash, and other performance issues. It's a shame these phenomenal ideas get left to die from simply not being optimized.",

        "review": "If you have never played this game before, Returnal is an amazing single-player experience. The grind to develop the skills to play the game well enough to finish a cycle for the first or second and so on times is paralleled by a story that is often told in pieces, but not always linearly. To tell you much more about progression would likely spoil you, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nOnce you have largely finished the main game, though it is accessible beforehand, is the game's Tower of Sisyphus score attack mode. This mode is single-player only, and includes an additional chunk of story and lore to take in as your reward for climbing higher and higher in the tower, though this reward is somewhat limited and delivered in a... in my opinion somewhat awkward fashion.\n\nIf you have played this game before, your primary reason to get it would be to play with your friends who haven't played this game before, as the co-op features in this game are restricted to players on other PC platforms. If you're an anti-Epic Games person, the co-op experiences- and many online features- are still beyond your reach, as Returnal uses Epic Online Services for multiplayer and online functionality.\n\nI cannot talk about my experience with co-op as I haven't actually played it in co-op before. This is due to my insistence on wanting to play with my own friends, specifically, but if you're less interested in that and just want to play co-op, you do have the option to join or host a public cycle for other players to join.\n\nCurrently I'm playing through the game again on PC to scratch the itch that remained after I played it on PS5. Somehow, I'm still discovering brand new things- cutscenes I don't remember, areas and secrets that I felt like I never encountered- and it's been weirdly magical getting to experience this game again on my controller scheme of choice, mouse and keyboard. That said, if you've got a PS5 controller (a DualSense?), the adaptive triggers and rumble features are really something else, I highly recommend trying the game with it at least once.\n\nI do have two main complaints:\n1. This port features some significant graphical bugs and glitches compared to the PS5 version. Volumetric fog appears pixelated, even at the highest in-game setting (Epic), like it's rendering at a lower resolution than the rest of the game. Reflections in certain parts of the game can stagger awkwardly. Shadows and lighting sometimes shift dramatically from room to room in an instant, which is especially notable in the first biome. Props sometimes do not animate correctly, moving out of sync or in shifted positions during cutscenes. Some of this apparently depends on your frame rate.\n2. Once you have finished the game and developed the skills to play it well, it stops feeling so challenging without deliberately making it harder for yourself. I wish there was a way, in-game, to scale difficulty higher- add more projectiles, more enemies, more damage, more enemy health, etc. In the Tower of Sisyphus mode, this already happens to an extent- and I'd like to play the main game now feeling like it's a similar difficulty to my first experience with it. A difficulty marked Easy -> Extreme would be a start, but I believe Housemarque has mostly moved on to newer things.\n\nEven so, my complaints are largely superficial compared to the overall experience you get from this game as a new player. If you have a PS5, it might be slightly wiser to get this game on PS5 and leave it at that. But if you don't, this version of the game is more than equipped to take you on the same journey, both as a player, and in your role as Selene.",

This game feels like Risk of Rain 2 meets Metroid, it’s just awesome. The gunplay feels unmatched by nearly anything else I’ve ever played. The co-op is a blast and the boss fights… the boss fights… they’re so incredibly well designed. You’re constantly having to balance bullet hell mechanics and platforming, but the fights never feel cheap, you might die a few times, but it always feels fair. The Nemesis boss fight is seriously so good and ridiculously fun. Each biome features unique enemy types, and the map layout is procedurally generated, which helps the restarts feel interesting. The story is unfortunately the weak part of the game, but the entire package around it is just so good! Highly Recommended. \n\n\n🖥️ System Specs \nIntel i9 13900K | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 FE | DDR5 32GB RAM | Alienware AW3423DWF 3440 x 1440 165Hz\n",

        "review": "Returnal is an extraordinarily underrated gem of a game. Never has a game kept surprising me over and over with its new mechanics, enemies, and story.\n\nTo best explain Returnal's experience, think of it as a Roguelike Metroidvania; every time you die, you come back to the starting location, and you need to start over again. However, every time you go through, you'll find locations that you simply can't access under normal circumstances because you just lack the necessary tool to get through that specific part.\n\nNot to mention, despite the overwhelming appearance of things, Returnal is a challenging but relatively fair (and easy) game. I've managed to beat the game with only 3 cycles, which may say a lot about me personally, but the game works best when you die a few times so it can unlock new stuff for you to find and keep you hooked into it.\n\nAll being said, this is a brilliant game that you should play, even if you've never played Roguelikes before.",

        "review": "Where to begin....Returnal is my favorite game. My desert island game. I have 245 hours on my PS5 so it's amazing to have this on PC now. For me, this game has the tightest, most responsive controls I have ever experienced in a game. Everything just feels perfect. Right down to the aiming and jumping, it all feels dialed in to a level I have yet to find in any other game. The dualsense PS5 controller imo is a must to truly appreciate how good this game plays and feels. Every single detail in the environment (especially combat) is communicated to the player through the controller. I personally love how everything is randomized. You don't get to pick the weapons you start with. This, I feel, forces you to learn every weapons strengths and weaknesses which in turn makes you a more skilled and experienced player. Simply put, this game is a masterpiece. Of course it's not perfect, no game is....but If you enjoy challenging games with near infinite replay value then you owe it to your gaming self to play this amazing gem.",

        "review": "This game is a good contender for the middle recommendation button that steam does not have and so i will go with won't recommend this game.\n \nThe game has a presentation that is 10/10 and that's what made me buy it. The graphics are jaw dropping if you have everything on ultra + the rtx features turned on.\n\nHere are a few things that make me not recommend this game:\n\n-The movement is sometimes unpredictable when you need precision jumping on platforms. You somehow always manage to jump further than you wanted and the mid air controls are not the best (i'm not talking about the longer dash, just the jump itself).\n\n-The weapon upgrades sometimes make you feel like a god getting that extra damage you needed and the other times makes you feel like the game hates you by not giving you a good upgrade to keep up with the ever harder enemies.\n\n-The convoluted way of advancing the story and getting the real ending. That last sunface fragment in biome 6 almost made me go crazy.\n\n-The performance is horrible. I'm running a 4090, ryzen 7950x3d and 64gb ram. I had some crazy drops from 150+ fps to around 70-80 in some zones. Ohh and the crazy amount of vram usage. This game 100% has a memory leak because i would start up the game and have 7-8gb vram used not even 2-3 hours later it would jump up to 11-12gb vram used which is insane if you think about it. Not everybody has a 4090 to play this game without using all of the available vram.\n\n-The price way too high for a 2 year old game, yeah yeah it just came to steam in 2023 but the release was in 2021. It's almost as Sony doesn't want this game to sell and have more people play it.\n\n\nDo i recommend the game at this current miserable 20% sale? Nah! Maybe a 40-50% sale and it's a worthwhile purchase, but be ready for some performance issues if you have a low to mid pc build.",

However there are several gotchas:\n- beginning levels are to dark and compact, had to use Detective Vision to often; hard to see, died regularly\n- starting pistol is absolutely useless even if several cycles later with higher weapon proficiency\n- standing | slow walk aim function is useless during live combat with multiple pursuing enemies - game designed as run-shooter only\n- cannot carry more than one weapon type at a time - very bad design, no in-combat weapon selection\n- half or so weapon alt-fire functions are useless in live combat with multiple pursing enemies\n- story is meh, don't care about main character personal relationships however alien connection is fascinating; plot could have been more generic to facilitate custom user character from start - playing as blondie chick interrupts immersion\n- dash function almost useless during live combat - cool down to long, sequencing to short; great for exploring though\n- Tower of Sysphus is meh, breaks-up main plot monotony\n- health items (green) stack to build higher suit integrity even if health bar full - never clearly explained in tutorials\n- buy at discount, prepare to spend time getting acclimated to developer mandated run-n-gun play-style\n- game could have greatly benefited from tighter \"Devil May Cry\" controls and improved melee combat; there's an unsettling pause between strikes, features seem instinctively cut or missing, melee functions not fully realized or fluid\n- game crashed a few times during play - nothing to bad but very annoying if at higher levels (have to start at beginning cycle to build suit features for final citadel boss)",

        "review": "[h1]Oh. My. God.[/h1]\n\nSome of the most insane and satisfying gameplay I've seen. I read reviews but they don't do it justice.\n\nIt's a little hard, but not in the way that beats you down. It throws upgrades at you constantly -- none of that \"here's a weapon every 5 seconds but they're all bad\". No, you get some sort of upgrade practically every couple minutes. Plus the meta-upgrades that carry over. You're meant to die and start over, and I love how it ties that into the gameplay. Also, while I like some weapon style a [i]little[/i] more than others, they're all really good -- just pick up the highest level weapon you find and you get a ton of variation.\n\nVery well paced - some intense bullet hell fire fights intermixed with some exploration of really great environments and compelling storyline. Battle, loot, die, try again and hope you get a little farther. Roguelike loot.\n\n[b]The level design though - amazingly crafted.\nVisually incredibly stunning and fabulous boss/creature design. Really cool weapons too.[/b]\n\nHands down the coolest game I've played in a long while.\n\nGreat port to PC - have had no issues.",

        "review": "Finished the whole game, got the secret ending. I think its a really good game that's not really a rogue-lite but has some mechanics in. I loved the story and the mystery, I loved the gameplay, I loved the art style. It's a shame this game is so demanding with its graphics because I feel more people should play it. \n\nThe game is hard at the start but once you get the ball rolling it gets easier. One tip is to focus on upgrading your weapon mods rather than trying to progress at early game, because they're busted. One thing I wish the game could have done is make the early game a little easier for those who aren't used to shooters like this. Luckily, I managed to pick up the mechanics easily and had little trouble there, but I can understand why a lot of people give up at the first boss. \n\nLoved the bosses in this game though. All of them were very memorable, and I especially loved [spoiler] Hyperion. [/spoiler]. The lead up and boss fight were amazing.  \n\nOne thing to note i'm getting a lot of stutters on a ryzen 5800x and 3070ti on 1080p ultrawide, though the settings in this game are superb and there is so much thought put into them, I wish they could put in a bit more effort into the optimization.\n\nOverall 9/10\n\n",

However, it seems that the developer's personal preferences may have influenced its design, which makes it particularly enjoyable for hardcore gamers. Once you become familiar with its mechanics and gain proficient shooting skills and patience, this game can become addictive, though some players might find it a bit repetitive after a while. Personally, I like to come back to it from time to time, but I find it challenging to play for long hours consecutively.\n\nAdditionally, for casual gamers, this game might present a bit of a challenge, especially during the beginning and boss fights, which could potentially lead to some moments of frustration.",

I paid full price and don't regret a cent. The action is incredible. It's a game that demands you improve until the very end. Act I pushes you to play well and learn the mechanics, and once Act II starts, they ramp up the difficulty to make you wonder why you ever lost to Phrike. Every new world changes the way you approach combat, each new piece of gear changes the way you traverse, every new gun changes the way you think about enemies. It's just an amazing ride, start to finish. \n\nMy PC is a powerhouse and I maintained 90+ frames despite my ultrawide and some actually insane bullet hell sequences. I saw some other reviews discussing bugs, but I experienced very few (my screen went dark after a teleport at one point and it almost cost me my final run but the game recovered. The only other issue was a crash near the beginning of my playthrough). \n\nHuge thanks to housemarque and climax for an incredible experience. I'm not done with Returnal, and don't think I will be for a while.",

The difficulty increases stupendously.\nI only managed to \"win\" Act 1, because I got lucky and found some gear that restores my health on a continuous basis. Which is the utmost level of stupidity in any game design: basing playing success on pure luck. There is no path you can learn to get to some specific loadout you like.\nJust grind until you get lucky.\nCool.\nI'm in my mid-40s, I work 40 hours a week (minimum) and instead of being able to relax at home I need again to work countless hours until that one lucky run where the stars align and I can progress. And no way to reduce difficulty.\nScrew that!\nAnd screw any developers who think that luck is a meaningful game mechanic!\n\nI really want to find out more about the character's backstory, but it appears I will either never know for myself or have to go watch some videos of somebody else playing the game. Reinforcing the feeling of inadequateness, since apparently some people manage to grind through this disaster.\n\n\n",

Guns really differs from one another and feel and sounds fantastic.\nProcedural generation is interesting and varied enough to not be too repetitive, but to still allow you to learn the different parts of a level.\n\nParasites, resines, relics and consumables allow some truely interesting builds, and can make or destroy a run depending on your (poor) choices.\nNegatives effects add some great risk/reward layer on top of it.\n\nAmbience and sound design are top notch, as expected from a AAA studio nowadays. The music is more of an ambient layer, but not very memorable.\n\nStorywise, it's cryptic AF, and you slowly try to entangle fragments of texts, visuals, audio, until you reach the true ending, and then well... Still don't get a clear vision of it all. It's still interesting and making theory about it is fun enough.\n\nConcerning the difficulty, yes, Returnal is tough, and knowledge of level parts, enemy attacks, and learning to position yourself will be necessary to succeed. Note that I am an average player, so your experience might be different.\nMy only disappointment is about bosses. While being memorable encounters and fun fight, I found them lacking in difficulty comparing to the rest of the game in general. \n\n",

        "review": "Great game, bosses are though easy, but with huge 3x health pools, compared to some of the normal humanoid enemies, and the toughest enemies are minibosses with orange health bars.\n\nYou have 6 biomes to explore plus a tower, not sure about the tower difference between two timelines.\nBoss amount though doesn't correspond to the amount of biomes.\nFirst 3 have 3 bosses, the rest 3 have 2. First two are optional later on, and the same goes for the 4th one.\n\nAnd then there is the tower boss, first and only time I encountered it, I got there with a rocket launcher, and to my surprise it did 0 damage to it, first though maybe I was missing some mechanic, but the alt fire that threw a grenade did damage to it, so I was basically doomed to die, as I wouldn't beat him just with an alt fire grenade that does barely any dmg, if it hits.\n\nAlso keep in mind this is a rougelite 3rd person shooter metroidvania/platformer.\nOnly thing you keep is an ingame currency for various things, and information, lore and weapon traits (keep in mind to pick up the weapon that has \"new\" written next to the trait, otherwise the game won't remember that you've found said trait on that weapon, if you don't like to use that weapon at that moment), everything else is restarted, though the 6 biomes are halved in terms of dying and where you start again, and if you ever get to the 4th biome, to get back to the first 3 without using co-op, you have to complete the 6th biome once. Sadly you can't carry over your temporary progression over to the other timeline after finishing the 3rd biome, or finishing the 6th biome. Each timelines 3rd/(6th) biome end acts as a death.\n\nLoads of varied ranged weapons, each weapon has many traits, but the same amount.\nYou can only equip one weapon at a time, but you can switch any time you want, as long as you have access to the area where it was dropped.\nFirst 3 biomes are limited to first 15 weapon levels, starting from 4th you start at 15 and can go up to 30. In the tower you can go from 1 to 45, depending maybe from which act/biome you start the tower.\nLevels also unlock how many traits a weapon can have.\nYou also have a melee weapon that is a permanent unlock, and it's possible to make a melee build, but not suited to battle bosses.\n\nYou can also temporarily upgrade your stats, gain artefacts, and parasites (double edged sword).\nNot sure about stat limits, the only limit that I know of is the health stat limit which is 300%, but you can gain that by collecting 3/2 resins, or silphiums when at full health, besides upgrading, or through some artefacts or parasites.\nArtefact limit is 15, but you can destroy the ones you don't like to equip new ones.\nParasite limit exists too, but each new one you pick up, will replace a random parasite, same with removal through some game mechanics. each are pretty much as 1 place where you can sell equipped parasites randomly.\n\nThere is also a debuff mechanic that gives you up to 2 negative effects (malfunctions), each of them also has a special requirement that allows you to remove them, though there are some parasites/consumables that can remove them. 3rd debuff can't be gotten, but instead you'll get a critical malfunction that will destroy 1 random artefact.\n\nThere is also a buff effect called adrenaline for killing enemies, stacks up to 5, each one gives various effects to you, but they're always the same, also when you're at max stacks after killing a certain amount of enemies you get a shield buff, protects you from 1 hit. When you do get damaged, you'll lose all stacks. You can also equip multiple different shield buffs. Though be careful when falling down with a shield effect, some shield effects will cause a black screen after respawning the last spot where you were standing, you can't hear anything too, but you can move, so don't move, otherwise you can fall again, and just alt+f4 out of the game after waiting few seconds if you're safe, just to be sure the game saved. Though do mind because of that, sometimes weapons on the ground will have all their alt fire skills and traits erased.",

        "review": "9.5/10 \nWhichever psychopathic masochist came up with the idea a Rogue-like, bullet-hell, third-person shooter is a mad genius. This an absolute masterpiece of a game and one of the all-time best I've ever played. Every single aspect of this game is amazing: graphics, shooting, game-play, movement, combat, sound design. The music is really atmospheric and gives it a really cool sci-fi feel. The game runs incredibly well too (might just be my PC), it runs at a stable 120+ fps at ultra and looks amazing. Some of the coolest set-pieces I've seen in a game (my favourite is the citadel). The lore of this game is really intriguing with tons of stuff to uncover. Can be quite punishing at times but that honestly makes it more exciting. It also has online co-op to play with friend. One of my only criticisms of this game would be it's a little short for a Rogue-like as it only takes a few successful runs to complete the story content. I am also completely confused by what the story is meant to be. My only other criticism is that most runs feel pretty similar to each other, game-play-wise due to the only real difference being which gun you choose to go with, so I would compare it more to 'Hades' than 'Binding of Isaac' as far it's Rogue-like features go. I'm a little peeved that amazing games like this are kept from me for years because of consoles existing but that's an entirely separate topic. Absolutely would this recommend to everyone.",

        "review": "Firstly, I really wanted gave the game thumbs down.\n\nIt seems that the co-op mode was added to the game when the developers realised that the game was very boring in single. If you like podcasts or have a second monitor for video, then it is likely you can try solo.\nThe plot seems very intriguing at the very beginning. But then it falls into unrelated mess with metaphors, which such a casual person as I am not able to fully understand. if you want to understand the plot you have to do it in solo mode. Some activities are unreachable in coop. In my opinion, sharing items with a partner and sorting out enemies is much more fun than falling asleep.\n\nin general, coop mode is okay. The game that keeps you engaged solely by gameplay. I would like to recommend the game only in coop mode. It's fun, challenging and highly dynamic. Good variety of weapons / buffs + debuffs / enemies ([i]and bugs[/i])\nThe picture is beautiful, although the abundance of special effects sometimes burns out the eyes.\n\nI understand the teleportation to the host as a quick and not too painful compromise. But sometimes it's too crooked. When you use location teleport it throws you back, when the host uses teleport game teleports you to the host, but when the host destination is not too far you have to use the teleport, but the teleport cannot be used because it is still occupied by the host... you cannot use the teleport when it is busy. But there are also teleports that must be used only together. Not many, it seems to be a trifle, and adds a sense of crookedness.\n\nBugs. Mostly missing indicators on the map or items that are located in different places for players. But, I faced \"invisible\" enemies once and the run was ruined. Also, the host player faced \"out of video memory\" on RTX 3090. And the icing on the cake, when the host was knocked out and I fell down, because of which the game cutscene did not start and we just got stuck. As a result, 2.5 hours were wasted. More to add, some type of enemies are broken. Sometimes they show animation that they are going to attack with the teleport but sometimes they do it just in a moment, so you don't have any chance to evade it.\n\nReturnal means that you have to return. But most runs are really long. You can pause the run, but in this case, after restarting, your partner’s progress will be cancelled and it’s not a fact that you can call him into the game, due to the conventions of the cooperative mode.\n\nDespite all the indignation above, we had a great time: we swore, laughed, analysed and tried different tactics, rejoiced at overcoming difficulties. All good qualities for a rogue-like game.\nThe harsh environment and the world force you to use what you get. And for the most part, the ecosystem of the game works to torture and please you, forcing you to complete one more run. \n\nI do not think that I will ever return to this game. But it will definitely be something to compare with.\n\nAs such, it's a good two-player co-op game, especially on discounts.\n\nThank you w3rwlf for the party.",

        "review": "Fun game. Gets challenging at times, but overall a fun and rewarding experience. There are a few metroidvania elements to it as well, which at first may leave you scratching your head(it's not too bad and you quickly realize it).\n\nThere are basically 2 game modes to play. There's the main story to go through where you go through different biomes slaughtering everything and grabbing weapons and items while trying to stay alive, fighting bosses, dying and doing it again. Then there's The Tower, where it's much more fast paced with little time to rest, just going from one encounter to the next.\n\nThere is online co-op which is really cool. Basically you and another person can play the main story mode and go through the levels and bosses together. A couple notes on multiplayer:\n1- Weapon drop rates seem severely reduced, adding to the challenge.\n2- If one player dies, they have to wait to be revived by the other. Can be nice, but can also be tedious as depending on the situation, you could just be waiting around for minutes on end.\n3- If a player disconnects during a session, they can't be brought back into the session. It gets locked out. You have to reset a run from the start. I found this to be an issue as in multiplayer I had an issue where if I fell off a ledge into a pit, I would respawn but the screen would go black. Gameplay and sound was still present, but my screen was black. The only way to fix it was to close the game and reopen it. Once you get back you can't re-invite a friend into the game, you have to start it over. \n\nIf you pick this up on sale it's well worth it if you like roguelites. It'll get your adrenaline going and keep you coming back for more death after death.",

You have to reboot the game, and then you will see the first issue\n- Game crashes about 30-60 minutes at random\n- Stuttering happens at random when enemies spawn (RTX 3090 here)\n- If you have multiple screens and you alt-tab once, the game will not be able to lock the cursor to it's screen again, wasting the run.\n\nThose issue above do not have working workarounds. The VP9 codec fix people refer to is for a different issue (which you may also have). If you have any of those issues, you they will happen EVERY time, its not intermittent.\n\nGame is unplayable.

        "review": "This game has loads of potential. The graphics and atmosphere are great, the combination of bullet hell, first person shooter and rogue-like is great. The story and sound design is great. Single-player mode is mostly fine, but the business logic developers have unfortunately terribly failed to build a system free of race conditions. Almost every multiplayer scout session, there is a new bug encountered:\n* Spawning below the floor\n* Falling to death after entering a crypt for no reason\n* Camera staying permanently tilted after exiting a teleportation animation\n* Biome 2 Boss getting stuck at the border of arena, refusing to transition phase\n* Teleporters stopping to function\n* Items in a room spawning invisible for scout\n* Individual Bosses suddenly doing 10x damage to scout for no apparent reason\n* Spawning in coop without any perma upgrades (despite host having them)\n* Spawing in coop with permanent black screen \n* Spawning in coop, unable to move\n* Map permanently staying hidden after leaving a crypt\n* Biome shop breaking, when host triggers backup machine in parallel\n* Doors permanently refusing to open\nThis is just a _subset_ of most annoying bugs, triggered by timing/level loading conditions (especially in multi player). The devs seem to be entirely oblivious how to properly handle latency, thread concurrency and packet loss situations. It's a shame, because the concept is really fun, but in a game with hours long run sessions and literally dozens of game breaking timing bugs like this, fun dies rather quickly.\n\nOn top of this, devs didn't manage to have PC and PS players join the same sessions, nor implemented the full steam API.  So you can't find or chat with your coop host in case your game just \"broke\" by one of the mentioned bugs above. Neither are there any emotes. This being said, I hope there is a successor which builds upon this game concept and has better coding.\n",

        "review": "A Decent (Hard) Third-Person Rogue-like Shooter\n\nI've only scratched the surface, and there are many more mechanics to unlock, but what I've experienced so far is engaging, albeit slightly frustrating. It's a love-hate relationship, for me. I want to explore more of the game world, see the weapons, level up my character, and become powerful to the point where the loot-loop becomes a fine-tuning process, and I have time to really build the perfect combo of abilities. However, what I often find myself doing is acquiring my first decent weapon, being unable to find (or afford) more health, and then failing at a boss.\n\nThere's no somewhat forgiving \"camp-fire\" / \"flask\" system from the 'Souls' games. When you restart, you start from scratch. Those player and gear levels all reset. It's brutal.\n\nI can already tell that once you get the hang of the \"parasite\" mechanic, and figure out the balance between the \"adrenaline\" enhancements, there's probably a lot of powering up to be had. The dash mechanic is really nice, and I hope that you are able to increase the distance and cool-down, to feel even more powerful. What's infinitely frustrating is the unforgiving nature of the game.\n\nFor example, one hit (in a bullet-hell world) will typically reset your \"adrenaline\" meter or nullify many power-ups. Health is also extremely scarce, and it would be nice to have some sort of always-present reward for player aggression (similar to 'Bloodborne', where you can regain health by aggressively attacking, within a short window).\n\nHousemarque has always been a favorite studio of mine. 'Super Stardust HD' and the PSP port were two or my all-time favorite games (bring those to PC, please), and 'Alienation' was one of the best 'Diablo'-esque co-op games I've ever played through (please also bring that to PC).\n\nThere are definitely some similarities between this and 'Alienation', but the biggest issue (and perhaps the shortfall of this game's design) is the third-person camera. I can't help but think that this would've been a much better top-down or \"twin-stick\" shooter; though, I'm sure they're probably tired of being known for that (why break what isn't broken?).\n\nWhile a few of the weapons are interesting (and others definitely are not), the reloads feel totally broken. There's not any vibration or audio cue to increase your chance of a proper reload. The mechanic is a bit like the classic 'Gears of War' system (on-screen prompt and everything), but you don't get that audio pitch change when the weapon runs dry, nor do you really have the time to babysit the half-baked mechanic while you're \"claw-gripping\" a controller to navigate away from the projectiles in-battle. And so far as I can tell, you can't decide when to reload; weapons either auto-recharge after a period, or you cook off the magazine to bring up the reload mini-game prompt.\n\nThere's also a melee sword attack - again, reminding me of 'Alienation' - but it doesn't appear to be a very deep mechanic, nor very effective against most enemies. Then again, maybe that improves, the longer you play.\n\nHousemarque has always been known for their amazing music and sound design. However, even with Dolby Atmos and nice headphones, the ambient soundtrack is indistinguishable from the sounds the aliens and robots make. While you're walking around, you won't be able to tell the difference between enemy sounds and the background world noises. It's very hard to locate enemy positions without looking at the map, and the game gets a bit too challenging early on to afford you those glances.\n\nAs with anything, it's possible this is by design. It just doesn't make for a fun experience when health is so limited and you have to play \"keep-away\" with every encounter, instead of feeling powerful. There's also a \"malignant\" de-buff system which is meant to create an element of mini-game challenges to \"cleanse\" your temporary skill handicap. You come across this when harvesting resources (opening chests, harvesting currency). You have the ability to either roll the dice with malignant infections or to \"cleanse\" the curse from the item by spending \"ether\" (which is exceedingly rare and needed for high-ticket upgrades and items).\n\nAgain, way too difficult to limit resources this much, especially earlier on, as players are still trying to learn all of the systems.\n\nI will also say, that while the music composition is appropriately dark, I do miss the catchy music of past Housemarque titles, which often helped with player focus in stressful \"bullet-hell\" moments. Perhaps it would be easier to focus on the stress of combat with the sort of music you'd find in something such as 'Nex Machina' (10/10, buy that game, immediately).\n\nMaybe I'm missing something, playing with the XBOX controller on PC, but I just constantly find myself spinning in circles and trying not to run into environmental hazards. Again, the third-person nature makes things a bit unfair, since the enemies still have split-second attacks and reactions as if this were a top-down shooter.\n\nWhen the original 'Resident Evil 4' launched, they solved this by having enemies behind the player approach more slowly, and they gave players the ability to quickly reverse their camera. In 'Returnal', if you're in a full arena, you are 100% going to be unfairly hit by waves of bullets and beams as you focus on what's in front of you.\n\nThe auto-aim is mandatory, in my opinion. I don't see how anyone could go very far, using a controller, without that feature. I haven't tried playing with the mouse and keyboard controls, because I thought that the rumble features likely added a lot to the experience, and had read that the game was purpose-built to to sell the DS5 controllers (maybe that is a hugely different experience, I don't know).\n\nAnother issue is that boss doors / arenas are only sometimes marked. There are copy-and-paste \"trap door\" areas which are 90% cool item stores or loot, or 10% the hardest boss you've encountered, so far. It's not very clear what is and is not a \"safe\" area, or a checkpoint. The in-game respawn mechanics are not very thoroughly explained, and you basically just have to find out, accidentally. Again, perhaps by design (and fitting for the theme), but a bit frustrating, given the investment of resources and the lack thereof.\n\nAnd when you inevitably lose to that surprise boss (immediately after you just defeated the previous one, and barely have any health), you start all the way from the beginning, again.\n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful at times, but nothing completely mind-blowing. I had read that it's a \"game which is only possible on next-gen hardware), but I could see it being downgraded a bit in texture resolution and appearing on the previous gen consoles.\n\nI played it maxed-out on a 3080Ti rig with an i7-11700KF and 128GB of DDR4, at 4K HDR 120FPS. Performance is overall smooth, until you get to the second world and the robots start spawning lots of projectiles in smaller spaces with environmental traps. DLSS implementation with UE4 seems to be a bit smeary and not-quite-there, but I may try the \"quality\" setting to see if that improves anything when hundreds of projectiles are on-screen. I opted to turn it off, for maximum sharpness.\n\nIt pains me to say this, but I'm a little let down. It's not bad by any means, it's just not as amazing as I had been told and doesn't scratch the same itch as other fast-paced Housemarque shooters. I nearly bought a PS5 for this game, and I'm thankful that I only had to spend $40 on a sale rather than going that route.\n\nI'd recommend 'Returnal' if you're a Housemarque fan, but come into it expecting a bit of a frustrating experience. Maybe watch higher-level YouTube recordings to see if it eventually becomes the sort of game you'd like. I chose to go into it blind, as they're one of my favorite game studios.\n\nIf I had to assign a number, I'd say it's a 6/10 so far. I want to love it, but it just hasn't grabbed me, yet.",

        "review": "This game just feels like a very barebones roguelike. Most of the upgrades that you get mid run are all boring ass percentage based upgrades: \"your gun deals 10% more damage\", \"deal 30% more damage to targets with low health\". I don't know dawg, maybe Risk of Rain 2 has spoiled me with meaningful items, but the items in this game do not feel good at all to get. Half the time it doesn't even feel like I've gotten any upgrades, I believe the game to do the maths but the gameplay is barely affected by it. \n\nThe weapons are really cool tho, too bad you are limited to one at a time instead of changing your playstyle on the fly. The game is already a high octane bullet hell dodge fest, why not give the option to change weapons to suit the situation that the bullet dodging has forced you into? \n\nMy first impression of the game is that it was one of the truly \"next gen\" games that we've been promised. The technical aspect is really impressive but man, this game really doesn't know if it wants to be Doom Eternal, Risk of Rain or Metroid Prime. It takes a little bit of everything but doesn't really manage to glue it all together. The pacing of Doom Eternal without the flexibility of the weapon system. The roguelike elements of many games but without items that truly impact how you play. The exploration and atmosphere of Metroid Prime but without the metroidvania elements to properly back it up. As wide as a lake and as deep as a puddle. \n\nIts fun, but its disappointing in many fronts. I would recommend it to people who haven't played a roguelike before. I was very excited at the prospect of a triple A budget roguelike but this game really misses the mark there, specially compared to other options in the market.\n\nEdit: After playing more I can confirm that it doesn't get better, the lack of build variety just makes it more repetitive. You just pick up the one gun that you like, get as much HP increases as you can and that's the build. Not a good roguelike, this game really should've been a regular third person shooter.",

I defeated all the bosses first try, hell i defeated final boss first try without getting hit, so thats why i said you will enjoy it if you suck at games cuz you will get more out of it, yes there's like a bunch of challenges and endless run but it doesn't beat the atmosphere and tension that main story brings.\n- While we at it, story, damn so, starts off interesting, gets a lot more interesting and then for me ending was nothing. it made no sense it answered nothing so this game is purely for visuals and game play. Story not so much\n- But biggest con for me is that it was waaay to easy, people on internet say that final boss is a tuff that the whole game is \"devilishly difficult\" and I'm just sitting there confused as hell thinking i might have played the game on easy mode but you are only stuck on one difficulty.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like SF, fast paced third person bullet-hell shooters, with satisfying gameplay and a lot of movement and dodging, this game is for you get it you wont regret it. its awesome and I enjoyed every single bit of it and will definitely 100% it. BUT if you are planing on buying it WAIT FOR SALE!!!! other than that I would recommend",

But it just feels tedious, I feel like I'm not learning anything new w.r.t. enemy patterns or mechanics on each death. It just feels like I'm dying because I accidentally hit a dead end in a randomly generated room and all the mobs cornered me. This wouldn't be a problem if you could carry more than one gun, but usually what happens is that I'm locked into one style of play based on the only gun I'm carrying. Also the decision to have your main currency disappear within seconds of an enemy dying, forcing you to put yourself in bad situations to collect money, is...an interesting one for sure.",

Either the story telling is kinda sub par and up its own ass, or there's a long way to go.\n\nEdit:  Nope.  Story writers are up their own ass.  Ridiculously vague to the point where they aren't even telling a story.  Just making you write it yourself, based on their vague hints.  Maybe if they throw in a few more inscrutable references to Greek/Roman mythology it will make you think they're totally deep.\n\nGameplay is pretty good, though.",

        "review": "I just rolled credits after beating the Act II final boss. My in-game time says 13 hours played (I have a habit of leaving games open sometimes). I have a total of 19 deaths, about 5 of them are my first time getting to the fourth biome and having real bad luck. I only add this as context to what I've played and experienced in this game. I'm not done playing, but I've played most of what the game has to offer.\n\nTLDR; Overall, I would say this game is an enjoyable experience with lots of fast paced and active content. If the combination of metroidvania, bullet-hell, and rouge-like mechanics with a narrative element sounds appealing then I would definitely recommend. $60 is a steep price. The $48 sale that I purchased at felt much more justifiable but closer to $30 would be the sweet spot (if it goes that cheap any time soon). Some performance bugs were annoying but did not detract from my overall experience.\n\nLots of people say this game is challenging. I can see why. However, I found it too easy to steamroll a run through of the game. Once you have enough health to make some mistakes, and gather ether for the death checkpoints, it's a breeze. \nThe weapons were interesting and enjoyable with nice design and effects. The music, sound design, and environment design is well done. None of the rougelike or bullet-hell mechanics ever felt unfair, it was always my fault if I got hit or died. \n\nCo-op play seems interesting but is not the focus of the game. The hosting player cannot get scout rank (which is not that important) and the joining player cannot earn permanent upgrades (way more important). Co-op seems designed for late game play when there are less unlocks to worry about missing out on. And the Tower of Sisyphus SHOULD be coop (the endless mode). Luckily, there seems to be a mod to allow it to work in Co-op mode.\n\nGraphics are amazing but I personally had performance issues. I have a Ryzen 3700X and an RTX 3070, playing at 1440p 165hz. My rig doesn't struggle too much but I had lots of performance issues with this game. After reading up, it seems that Ray-Traced lighting is a no-go for now and the performance issues come from loading areas of the game between rooms. It was most frustrating during boss fights and fighting groups of enemies. It was not the end of the world, but it was annoying.",

        "review": "This might be some unlucky coincidence with my setup, but despite covering the recommended requirements and then some for the most part, and completely covering the minimum ones, the games runs like ass with everything on low for me. Fatal Error CTD's every 30-60 minutes, choppy performance all the time, invisible projectiles and other effects, the game failing to load new rooms - sometimes for a full minute, you name it. Seems the devs were somewhat aware of the last one because most gates have \"door jammed, unlocking\" state as a workaround to let the next room load, but the boss gate does not have this feature so I fell through the floor of the last room in the overgrown ruins a couple of times.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't say the game itself is anything to die for either. Basically they fused rougelike and action adventure gameplay with a mysterious story. The story could be good from what I've seen so far, but the rest of the game is somewhat lacking in execution - the rougelike elements do not provide sufficient variety across runs, and the action adventure ones do not do anything to distinguish themselves from other entries in the genre. Ultimately what it achieved for me with its gameplay was make me want to play the better games its aspects remind me off again.\n\nIf either the game did a better job of hooking me in or I did not have such severe technical issues I'd probably give it a thumbs up, but under these circumstances I cannot do so in good conscience.",

There were times where the game glitched out, but I don't remember any hard crashes.  Story is amazing as is gameplay, but I almost feel like it's light on content for being a rogue lite.  It also really doesn't help that the achievement list really doesn't help make matters better. Finding glyphs randomly where there is only a small chance for each one to spawn?  Die over and over to reload the map to run through the map to try to find a single glyph?\n\nThat's a no from me, Dawg.\n\nAnyways, overall this is highly recommended!

        "review": "An almost great game ruined by stupid design decisions.\n\nWhen I first opened this game it seemed great with an interesting story and very satisfying gunplay and combat.\n\nUnfortunately, one stupid design makes the entire game not worth playing: Actually shooting the enemies normally gimps your progress by not rewarding currency. Instead the optimal way to play is to cheese, wait behind cover and melee wherever possible.\n\nThe devs tried to artifically increase the variety of upgrades by making oblites (the upgrade currency) shoot in every direction and despawn near instantly after shooting an enemy. This means to collect enough currency to meaningfully progress you end up having to cheese enemies wherever possible, waiting for them to be in a position where it's easy to collect and making sure not to kill more than 1 at a time. This ends up entirely ruining the flow of the combat, the pace of the game and the overall experience.",

Graphics are also really great, though, audio vocals are inconsistent, often soft and difficult to hear. 3D audio and other options were NOT useful in fixing the INCONSISTENT VOCALS. I would score this game a 9 out of 10 until it becomes IMPOSSIBLY DIFFICULT and therefore NO LONGER FUN. The gruelling difficulty is compounded by the fact that you CANNOT SAVE your game at any one point and return to your save point. When you die you lose almost everything and have to START ALL OVER AGAIN from your crashed ship. We BADLY need a DIFFICULTLY OPTION available by default to make this game SENSIBLE and REASONABLE for most normal players. I don't want to spend hundreds of hours REPEATING in DIRE FRUSTRATION! WeMod offer some CHEATS that ALLOWED ME TO PROGRESS, but I shouldn't have had to cheat! Come on! I honestly can't recommend this game in it's current form. You might love it and really do your best, but you will end up giving up in frustration or cheating as I did.",

Stripping it down to its components; yeah, its roguelike in its level design (the closest I've seen to it is if you were playing with Dungeon Tiles in tabletop). Yes, its a bullet hell.  But most of all it reminds me of Control in its action and deep lore, of Dark Souls in its slow peeling of the onion with repeated runs.  An intriguing mystery that's worth the effort. 10/10 for sound design as well; puts you in the heart of the action.  AAA for presentation, well done Housemarque.\nCons : its not the most stable of ports, on a old i7 with a 3080 I was getting big framerate drops/spikes; on a 7800x3d 4090 I still get CTD and screenlock on loading sometimes.  Persevere though, and the massive range of PC options are really lovely to customise and enhance the experience.  \n",

I managed to quickly speed through those areas again with the assistance of cheat engine but for this to have been a problem and even be a problem on the PS5 version for as long as this is not acceptable.\n\nI played it for 9 hours and was not too keen on starting over with the potential for this to happen again in another ten hours. With cheat engine I was able to get back to the point I was at and complete the game from there, but at that point I was so angry I just left the cheats on and bypassed the mechanics entirely to see more story elements. Those bits also did not impress me by the end. \n\nIts a beautiful game and manages to have some impressive effects and bosses but the second I finished the main plot I had no interest in ever launching it again.",

I'm not the best at the game's fast-paced combat, but even dying feels less disheartening within this game's unique thematic presentation. The story is quite out there and reminds me of my favorite things about films such as Annihilation from 2019. Also a huge fan of the music and sound design, really nails that eerie, unnerving vibe! I'm altogether enjoying my time on Atropos, and I definitely recommend this game, especially on sale.",

        "review": "Was really excited to play this and grabbed it as soon as it went on sale. Firstly, the game runs horribly. I frequently drop frames despite having the recommended specs. Despite only playing the game for a short time, I've also had numerous texture bugs, as in many textures simply did not load in. Low frame rate, poor textures, and an over-use of bloom often makes it hard to tell what's going on and react accordingly.\n\nI think I could overlook the technical issues if the game was better designed. But so far it also suffers the classic Sony issue of being split between trying to be  a fun game and a narrative experience. Everything feels over animated. Get ready to spend a lot of time holding the scan button. This is not engaging gameplay, it simply slows the pace of the game and makes it feel like a slog to start. The story line is interesting, but it gets in the way of the gameplay. It's also hard to tell what enemies are doing. For example, there's a flying enemy which aims an orange beam at you. I've seen this move countless times already, and still have no idea what it's doing. It doesn't seem to deal damage, but it also gives every indication that it does (bright red color, following the player, ect.). Other times elite enemies leap across rooms in a flash, which often feels unfair. Enemies in general have too much health, again making the combat feel like a slog. The game gives every suggestion that it's meant to be fast paced, but the actual gameplay feels unbearably slow. \n\nThe game also markets itself as a rogue-lite/like, however it is missing many of the staple features of the genre. There are only a handful of rooms, I've already memorized most of them after only a few hours. There are only a handful of weapons available initially, and while they seem to have some meta-progression, it does not feel meaningful. The active items feel similarly pointless. \n\nNothing about this game works for me. I have no inclination to keep playing, although I likely will try for a few more hours since I've already spent the money on it. I'm extremely disappointed. If you are at all skeptical of this game, don't bother. Just play Issac or Dead Cells.",

I didn't have the awful performance some had (5900x and 3080), but there were some really hard hangs during intense combat.\n\nif like me you bought the game partially with the hope of coop, don't bother, it seems to be unusable and incomplete.  Refunded, i was really excited to play this game with the understanding it'd be difficult.",

Graphics get a little funky on PC and it doesn't seem to matter if they're on epic or low. Same issues with texture popping in and out close and far. RTX OFF seems to fix some issues but not all. However, the game plays just as fluid and frantic as on the PS5 version. If you never played the PS5 version you don't know what you're missing. EASILY one of the best rogue games ever made. It's also technically amazing on PC with how well it works and how many options there are to cater the game to your needs. Great game. Can't say enough good about how awesome it is.",

        "review": "Changed my review from negative to positive. I initially had issues, like many others, where the game was crashing my computer. It turned out my cable extenders were bad, so I took them out and the game is working great now!\n\nAnyway, about the game itself... I LOVE this game. Everything about it - the setting, the gameplay, the story and lore. This game looks incredible and runs really well, the gameplay is really good and it is just a solid roguelike game. 10/10 recommend if you're into sci-fi (somewhat) horror. This game is sort of an amalgamation of several different games. To give you an idea, it's sort of like Risk of Rain crossed with Hades, but with a little Lovecraftian horror mixed in. Easily one of my favorite games that has released recently.",

I thought you can meditate here like on Doom Eternal, but game forces you to go back, to search for \"that door\". You come to one end - you need the ability you haven't posses yet. Now I feel like they distract you with a promising story, complex SFX and vibe, but it's so plain on surface.",

The onine is almost dead and in my 20 hours of playing I had multiplayer sessions only a few times. I didn't unlock all consumables and collectables, I didn't grind the tower too much, but I got the final ending and tower flowers ending. \nI don't think it's worth the full price without active online element so pick it up on a sale (or don't). The story is curious, but the gameplay loop is what I loved here more. \nSome guns are OP if you know when/how to use them, to a point where you can kill a boss with 2 stages within around 30 seconds and just a few dodges.\n\nI recommend to give it a try at least. I didn't expect to like it, but got hooked and even got DS5 for the game (but you can freely skip it - mouse and keyboard play just fine with rebound controls)\n\nBe mindful that Sony don't allow you to create a playstation account if you don't have one, so I was unable to connect the game to it to claim skins :-(",

Meshes their arcady style with a Hades-like plot progression in between your rougelite runs draped in a Giger aesthetic. \nThere's a surprisingly good story in there, even if it takes some piecing together instead of having it delivered as a breather between runs even if they do progress it. Some of the ocassional permanent upgrades act as enviromental keys, which combined with the atmoshpere and main character add a metroid vibe to the game, to the point where the most popular mod is a Play As Samus one. \nLots of contextual dialogue, intriguing plot tidbits, and build posibilities.\nBuild an undestranding of the world and story as you try to make your defintiive escape from the in-universe loop. If you like Hades, third person action, Nier, and Metroid Prime, you will probably love this.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971100793",

Just know you're going on a ride that will take you places and make you ask questions.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this feels perfectly balanced. It's not piss be good at OSU hard, but it also won't just let you through for breathing on it. As a roguelike it does have a lack of direct and impressive things to unlock to make the game easier, especially if you stick to running a \"main\" weapon, but if you take weapons as they come the properties you unlock will make you busted. It's also worth running through levels and stack as much as you can. If you do those things and practice staying alive and making the them unalive. You'll come out on top.\n\nAgain, dark SCI-FI planet, shoot weird aliens, and unlock a mystery that makes you ask \"what the fuck is happening\" a good 3 times over.\n\nA masterwork, and I can't wait to see what this studio makes and releases in the future.",

The storytelling is also really well done imo and it's been fun so far to read the ship logs and item descriptions. The gameplay is intimidating at first and you'll inevitably die a few times, but once you get into it it feels relatively balanced.",

Some weapons feel absolutely useless as you hope the next chest has a better roll. You look for every chance you get to cheese a boss, hoping that the door closes just before they charge.\n\nBut you persist. Your heart pounds as you somehow take down the first boss. The win feels good, but now the desert awaits. Getting to the beacon feels impossible. Closer, dying, closer, dying. The cycle feels endless, desperate. But when you hit the beacon...it is but one of many. \n\nYet the weapons grow in power. More is unlocked. Patterns in the bad guys start to emerge. Dashing feels natural. You realize you have a few precious i-frames on the use of your sword. Your grappling hook becomes your wings. \n\nSoon, that weapon you just got feels OP, broken. You wonder if the creators overlooked something. But as you look back at the hours you've invested, you realize: you earned that rocket launcher that both replicates hits as well as burns the bad guys. And soon after, you accidentally take down a horde of enemies in a single shot. \n\nThe last boss falls. Again. To your hand. You realize your health bar is nearly full after that last one. Your items languish in your inventory, unused, as you cross the finish line. Finally, the Truth of the Cycle dawns on you: you're not stuck on a fighting on a planet with aliens, they are trapped in an inescapable loop with the righteous avenger of wrongs: you.",

Limited progression is available for the joiner, and some critical story elements (eg House stuff) is not availabe in co-op.\n\nCo-op scaling is a bit harder than solo play, with 2x health on enemies, and no additional resource drops to support the now-two-player experience.",

I reloaded the game and it put me right back at the beginning - I guess that's why they call it Returnal. If the game worked it'd be fun but still not worth $60.

Edit: 67 hours to beat the boss that's actually the end boss (not counting the secret boss for the secret ending, which I'm trying for now). 2nd edit: PITCH BLACK GUILT. Play the game.\n\nThe gameplay is also great. It's well polished with a ton of different weapons and abilities.",

        "review": "This is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. I'm 52 and started at the Arcade to give you context.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. There are small lag spikes when entering new areas but it typically doesn't effect the gameplay. The DLSS 3 update jumped my frames from 165 to 205 on my RTX 4080, 4K, epic everything.\n\nThe mechanics and gunplay are top notch. There are a compliment of weapons, while not a lot, that make you think about the next drop to pick up. Sometimes the best rolled weapon is not the best to fit your playstyle. Learning to effectively evade the bullet storm, ensuring you are reloading at the proper time to increase damage, and picking up obolites (currency) from fallen enemies, can be easily accomplished but hard to efficiently master. I still have a hell of a time and I think I have the mechanics down pat.\n\nWhile you get stronger as you play, so do the enemies. Dependent on how many completions you've made, the same enemies you've gotten used to slaying will now have different special abilities or attacks. Using the environment to your advantage is a must. You should always seek some form of cover; never stay out in the open.\n\nMy major complaint with the game is the story. As much time as I've played and I still don't have a firm understanding of what the hell has happened. The story gives you snipits and never spells anything out. I don't expect this, but a little more would have been nice.\n\nI recommend this game at full price. If you have the machine to run it maxed, you will be amazed.",

        "review": "Amazing game. I dont even get mad when I die. I love how when you die it generates a new world for you, granted its the same world, but looks different. Just like Diablo 1-3 does. You can load into an area with the same objective as your last body, but every path will look different. The weapons are cool, and the combat system is really fun and super easy to get used to. With a 3080 card, and at 4k at 120 fps this game is beautiful. \n\nI would say it mostly resembles a Souls type of game. Like Elden Ring per say. Enemies kill you easily, and you lose everything when you die at first, eventually stuff stays. You gotta learn to dodge, and jump to get out of the enemies damage. Its a good challenge. \n\nIf you are looking for a game in space killing aliens like Doom, this aint for you. This game is totally different. Its a breathe of fresh air. I got it to test out my monitor that I just got that is 4k.",

There were a few minor stutters where it bottomed out for a few seconds (primarily after transporting and loading a new area), but it recovered just fine. From enabling performance stats on-screen, it's obvious that this is a GPU-heavy title, so the better you are in that department, the better off you're going to be. \nAmazing gameplay, voice acting is great and I'll definitely be getting lost in the sauce with this game.",

Not really much of a roguelite because the cards you get don't change the way you play. But it's still decently fun to play and boss fights are pretty nuts.\n\nA single game can take 3 hours if you are exploring and upgrading. It's pretty daunting to start a run, but can be more fun with a friend. Runs are saved and you can resume later, but your friend will lose all their equipment when re-joining you. The combination of extremely long games and broken co-op has caused waning interest before completing the game in it's entirety.\n\nProbably worth your money at the $20 mark. It'll start fun but fatigue fast.",

Got the Platinum trophy on PS5 back when it launched and I'm impressed how well and fluid the PC adaptation feels with M/KB. The game was definitely designed with a game pad in mind, so if you have access to a Dualsense controller the aim-function for that enhances the natural rapid pace of the game. \n\nAs some people have mentioned you are pretty squishy in base-form, but that's sort of the nature of a bullet hell game - which this is *very* much a bullet hell game. Others have also complained about luck-based aspect of the game but it's a roguelike so what did you expect? The upgrades and items start simple but the more you fail the more you're rewarded, and the more learn to properly stack items. So while a lot of it is up to luck, there's plenty of ways to be adaptable with what the game gives you and completely over-level yourself. The first time I ever beat it my health bar ran across the entire screen; partly due to luck and partly due to patience. If you have a loose idea for what you want for a build you can usually spec towards that if you play smart. \n\nUpgrades do come a little slow, and new items can only mostly be unlocked for a chance to find in a run at the beginning of each run - which depending on how good you are that could be an hour or two. Luckily there's a suspend feature to save your progress during said run. Outside of that it's extremely rewarding to do everything near-perfectly (especially in challenge rooms) because that allows you to stack on the upgrades faster and hit those overpowered moments. There's also a neat twist to the plot regarding the stages you play through and encourages you to play it over and over to explore areas and zones with newer abilities and situations. \n\nAlso, the Hollowseeker weapon is the GOAT, look for those in particular.",

Actually feels like an accomplishment when you finally beat each one. Story is amazing (though does allow for skipping cutscenes if you're not into that). Very excited to try out multiplayer co-op.

We played over 40 hours of it then, and it ran absolutely perfectly, not even a hitch, for over 8 hours a day.\n\n[strike]On PC it crashes constantly. It doesn't give me an error or anything, it just crashes and you're not playing anymore. The save system thankfully saves you just before the crash, but once it respawned me through the floor and Selene was stuck falling endlessly, lost a nice run to that.\nAs it is now, it's crashing every 15 minutes for me, which is atrocious, I cannot recommend anyone buys this, even though the game is one of the best ever made. What a shame.[/strike]\n\nAfter trying a lot of things, it turned out it was all my PC's fault, and now that I \"fixed\" it's problem, the game runs beautifully, and hasn't crashed at all. And it IS one of the best games ever made. Game of the decade for sure.",

        "review": "I'd start the review by saying: If you're looking for a bombastic roguelike experience, Returnal definitely isn't it, there's games that do this miles better (Binding of Isaac, Hades...), HOWEVER, if you're liking the game's vibe and are intrigued by what it's got to offer, I have good news for you - Returnal is a truly unique game with an interesting, mysterious storyline that's definitely worth playing through.\n\nI can understand if you're a bit afraid of the game being tough, it definitely is at times, and what doesn't help is the poor PC performance. On PC there are stutters even on high-end rigs so it's a bit of a coin toss whether the game will run good for you or not, but if you've got a high-end PC, the game should be running mostly fine for you. Returnal is pretty fast-paced and you will need to dodge a lot, so smooth fps will be key.\n\nI'd say the strongest part of Returnal is definitely its story. The story is slowly unraveled as you progress through the various zones in the game. There's been a lot of careful work done to make sure the game's presentation and story is top-notch. Everything from the graphics, music and audio, cinematics and writing has been done in a way that makes you dive deep into what's going on, and oh boy the game's definitely cooked up some great plot twists for you, but you're gonna have to dig deep to find them!\n\nThe gameplay itself (while not being varied enough for me to call it a proper roguelike) is great overall. The controls are smooth and the gunplay feels satisfying. The roguelike elements definitely don't hurt the game, there's enough decision-making involved to make your runs interesting. Though I feel like if the game wasn't roguelike and difficult, it would gain a lot more traffic.\n\nAs is, Returnal is quite hard to get into. The game runs rather poorly, has a lot of mechanics and systems (though they're quite easy to understand in a bubble, they do get piled on you pretty fast) and is overall rather tough, though you're far from powerless, there's a lot of revival options and player boosts to help you get through your next run.\n\nI feel like the best way to experience Returnal is to put on some headphones, immerse yourself while focusing on the gameplay so you can get through the story in full at least once. As a roguelike, it's nothing much, as a story/atmospheric game, it's amazing. So make up your own mind on what you're looking for when buying Returnal.",

I am almost in my 3rd play and still have not played coop because I waited 30 mins each time and game up, not sure if no one plays coop or if the coop is broken. either way I imagine this game is more enjoyable solo rather than have randoms stealing loot and dying quick in your playthrough.",

        "review": "Interesting concept, terrible optimization, lousy game depth.\n\nEarlier game is decent while you learn the mechanics and the story, later game is flat terrible. You spend thirty minutes carefully avoiding damage and hoarding health, then get dropped in 30 seconds because each hit lops off a quarter of what meager health you've managed to get, half the enemies are shielded, the other half have teleporting or homing attacks, and then when everything starts spitting out projectiles the performance drops to garbage and now the gameplay stutters.\n\nProbably the worst part is that you CAN increase base weapon power and thus start with a stronger gun... except the power level is stupidly and arbitrarily capped (so you can get to level 25 in a run, but will never start higher than 15 on each cycle) and you start every cycle with the SAME FREAKING PISTOL. Every. Single. Time. Yeah, the traits will vary, but it's still the same garbage pistol and you can easily spend 10-15 minutes barely scraping by because the randomized level system just will NOT drop a new weapon for you.\n\nOh, and the weapon traits. Only a few alternate fire modes are actually worth anything at all, and some weapon traits can make a gun all but useless. And since you can't control any combination of these things, maybe a third of the weapons you find are actually of any use and MAYBE ten percent are actually GOOD weapons.\n\nAnd the only thing as arguably as stupid as always starting with the pistol? Shielded enemies. Not a big deal when maybe one enemy in ten is shielded, but when you start entering rooms where literally EVERY ENEMY is shielded? And can do huge close-range spam attacks, making it terribly hazardous to break their shields with melee? Yeah, the game goes downhill HARD at that point because you've got a shooter that now wants you to use melee on everything but also has a terrible melee system.\n\nFor the power curve past the midpoint of the game, enemies rapidly get more powerful and more capable then you do. This means that, short of very lucky drops, you hardly ever get ahead of the curve and most fights turn into overlong grinds, especially as the shield ratio grows.\n\nUltimately, just another roguelike that screws up the balance and is arbitrarily limiting because it can't find creative or interesting ways to add challenge. Even on sale, it's just not worth the headache of trying to beat random chance for decent enough drops for a fun playthrough, much less a playthrough where you actually achieve any actual progress.",

        "review": "OVERALL 7/10\nSTORY: 7/10, After completing the game and watching a few YouTube video's concerning the story I am still lost and do not know what to think. Not really good for the dev's to leave so much open and to not give the player a sense of understanding as to what is really going on. I want this to be a 10/10, however it falls short with a loss of connection to the character's story. I want to know what the story is, not a class on the deeper meaning for whatever this is suppose to be. Also I was really hoping for this to be a real space type game where the character was really in space exploring or something and got the signal, then crashed landed and there is really aliens at play, not supposedly all in her mind B.S., at the end of the story I was truly let down by this unexplained conclusion.\n\nCOMBAT: 8/10. Enjoy the change from roll dodge to jump/dash. Weapons are different then we are used to in a shooter which was refreshing for me. enemy's remind me of Edge of tomorrow.\n\nGRAPHICS: 9/10 Beautifully created world for sure.\n\nMUSIC: 10/10 Bobby Krlic's work on this game is great.\n\nLOSS OF ITEMS UPON DEATH: 5/10. Took me soon time to warm up to how this game is designed and plays out. I do not at all enjoy games like this, however this one game I make room for. This type of gameplay turns me away as I can't stand loss of items and having to constantly farm stuff out upon death. Lack of health in the game and malfunction's get ridicules. So for me the game lacks a deeper immersive connection and turns me away from playing similar game's like this. \n\nI wanted this game to be a 9/10, just lacks connection for me to go there. I am even torn on the 8/10, maybe its a 7/10, lmao like the story, stuck in a never ending cycle of madness.",

There is 2-player online co-op if you're having trouble solo, score attacks if you enjoy that, and the game is very well optimized and stable.\n\nThe story will stick with you long after you've completed the game, both because of the amazing writing and the fantastic voice acting.  It's a very personal story about grief and trauma, and it pulls no punches, so be ready for that.  It takes a lot of inspiration from Greek Mythology and Greek Tragedies, but stands on it's own none the less.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.  Play with a controller if you can.",

        "review": "Exceptional gameplay, whether the story grabs you or not.\n\nI first learned about Returnal from Coach Toolshed's YouTube review.  I knew immediately that I wanted to play it, and I was very quickly disappointed to discover it was a PS5 exclusive.  Well, no longer.  I have to assume some of the difficulty has been lost in the changeover to MKB schemes, but that doesn't make this an easy game.  You have a reasonable amount of health, but healing can be difficult and a few mistakes can ruin an otherwise excellent run.  You're most likely to be defeated by being overwhelmed, and that's all a part of the unique draw of a bullet-hell TPS.\n\nEven so, the player is quite powerful, which adds to the sense of fairness.  There are plenty difficult trade-offs in every run, and the game allows you to be as smart or as stupid as you choose.  I particularly like how nimble you are, letting you keep up a strong defense with negligible interruptions to your offense.  Both the adrenaline system and the parasites are rewarding and unforgiving at the same time, which is a good mix for a roguelite.  I also enjoy the vaguely Metroid approach to key items, locking areas away behind ability acquisition instead of just relying on boss kills and keycards.  It's all part of the strong focus on gameplay and replayability.\n\nThere are a number of downsides, though.  I really like this game, but I have to admit that I enjoy it despite most of the visuals and all of the story.\n\nThe art style is extremely oppressive and dark, as you can see from any gameplay footage.  It's story-appropriate, and I do appreciate that in theory, but that doesn't make the endless piles of corpses, desolate and rotting environments, and highly suspicious omnipresence of tentacles any less grinding.  The quality of the work is very respectable, but it's no secret that roguelikes are very repetitive, so I wish we had a few more level pallets and a lot less ugly ruination.\n\nAs for the story, the plot is halfway-decent sci-fi pulp, which would be good--if it weren't for the all-but obligatory drudgery of a main character opining her bleary way through depression, hopelessness, guilt, dread, childhood trauma, pharmaceutical drug addiction, irrational fear, cruel fate, hallucinations, loneliness, and existential angst.  Oh, and don't forget that oh-so-worn-out \"awe\" we get to experience as we learn about this week's ancient, Lovecraftian, hyper-advanced, bloodthirsty, mythology-deconstructing, extinct alien race, all of whom were apparently well educated in neo-pagan nihilism and brutalistic architecture.  How the Hell have we made that bundle of ideas so tired?  I guess you can ask our clone army of twitter activist \"games journalists,\" or the copypasta studios begging for an ad spot in their endless exhibitionist psychiatric masturbation cam shows.  I'm sure there are lots of redditors who will find this sort of stuff deep, but I'm certainly not one of them; I enjoy grimdark as much as the next guy, and I can forgive a cliche or three, but there's just too much of both here.  It never lets up, and that makes it very hard to take seriously.\n\nAnd for the endless pouting anti-poetry of the audio logs, I will respond in kind:  \"Someone... made this... for me... it must mean... something... stupid.\"\n\nBut, thankfully, the story is pretty minor.  This game really does care about being a game first, and I can pretty easily shrug off the nightmarish pipe-dream annoyances.  It's a little bit overbearing the way that the game tries so hard to find in-world justifications for being a roguelite, but I can ignore that too, and I suppose some hermits would call it all \"immersive.\"  The first person \"horror\" segments are quite tedious, but they're not very long or close together.  They might even be optional, but I'm a mildly-jaded completionist so I'll never know.  Jane Perry does a bang-up job voice acting for Selene--though the entire Edge of Tomorrow reincarnation shtick had me wishing I was listening to--or at least looking at--Emily Blunt most of the time.\n\nBut you can't have everything, right?  It's nice to play a fun game, even if the writing is only trying to impress high school sophomores and the art direction is way too fascinated with Giger.  The score-attack tower climb is very fun, the daily challenges are enjoyably quirky, and the campaign levels are more than serviceable.  The 3D map is great, especially since it carries over one-to-one from the map menu to the minimap. The currencies are well-balanced, encouraging the player to explore thoroughly and risk death in challenge rooms and the occasional nasty secret area.  The platforming adds a lot to the game, both in combat and in traversal challenges.  The effects look great, and the enemy patterns are fun to learn.\n\nDeath has that signature appeal of good roguelikes and obscene hot sauces--it stings like Hell, but you're ready to do it again once the burns heal.  There are lots of build options, giving the player all sorts of limitations and opportunities to spark creative strategy.  It's always fun to plan your run around some strong items and abilities early on, then encounter something that can exaggerate your build into a glass cannon, or flip everything upside down with a brutal handicap or expensive sacrifice in exchange for an impressive new strength where you once had a dump stat.  The weapons are cool and diverse, with a wide variety of randomized mods; I would like it if the player could carry two or three, but that would bring in all sorts of balancing issues in a game that already boasts a complicated sandbox, so I won't complain about it.  \n\nI paid full price, and even with all of the annoyances, I don't regret a penny of it.  And that's all you can really ask for--a game with strengths to outweigh its weaknesses.  By that standard, Returnal is a success.",

I'm at 60 hours and still cannot beat the first biome. I'm lucky to even reach the boss, I have maybe 3 times. Biggest waste of my time in a game ever. I quit, I cannot do this anymore. I have beaten every souls game and yea, they pissed me off, but NOT like this. I am FURIOUS that I spent my money on this game. It is not possible for me to even beat. I am a daily gamer and when I see a challenge, I beat it even if it takes weeks. But this has become wasted time in my life that I will never get back.",

        "review": "This is a hard one to review. I've played 46 hours and beaten the game properly. Graphics are amazing, the gameplay is generally great, and the weapons are fun. The action is good.\n\nWhere the game falls apart is in a few places, first there is really limited permanent upgrades you unlock which leads your runs to being quite random, and often luck might determine things. After getting to act 2 I would just restart the run if the first room was too much. You always restart with a super weak weapon and even getting a different one can take a while.\n\nThe permanent upgrades on the guns are completely random and whether a gun comes with a slot that can be upgraded is also random. While the upgrade \"availability\" persists from run to run, it's really no fun grinding out weapon upgrades seeing as how rare they tend to be. Also some of the weapons (including the one you always start with), are actually pretty useless. I appreciate everyone might have favourites but if you watch videos on beating the bosses it tends to be done with the same types of weapons because the others are trash.\n\nThe entirety of Act 3 is simply replaying the game again. Doing so completes the story for \"real\", but given the abstract and open ended nature of the story it doesn't really feel complete. It feels like this was added on to increase play time.\n\nLastly, the game doesn't really build up on each run. Bosses for an area usually just need to be beat once (which at first is super wonderful given how hard they are!). But when you go for your next run, instead of trying to develop an amazing build you'll find yourself trying to get through the minimum number of rooms, taking the minimum amount of damage - hopefully getting some health max, maybe an artifact, and just trying to survive until you can advance to the level you're working on. Artifacts/items are super expensive, and the game doesn't scale well.\n\nAlso, if it matters there is no variable difficulty. I appreciate you need to die a lot in this game, that's part of the story. For some making it a bit easier to see the end might be nice.",

Rarely have I played a game that combined the narrative with mechanics (roguelike) so perfectly like this one (Hades was also good in this regard). To me the highlight of the experience was uncovering the lore and absorbing the atmosphere of this world + underneath all the layers of narrative there is a super fun core gameplay that is a super fast paced third-person shooter. I wanted to keep playing because the gameplay is super fun and I wanted to uncover more and more of the story because it was intriguing. As a fan of cosmic horror, sci-fi and action games, this is a 10/10.",

        "review": "I recommend it, but I think it's pretty flawed.\n\nFinishing the game one time through, and discovering the world for what it has is really interesting. A lot of fun to unlock the abilities in this game.\n\nBut many of the mechanics in the game are simply frustrating:\nAdrenaline is a cool concept on paper, where you get more buffs for getting kills without getting hit. Except that if you get hit you lose all of them, potentially making some items in your build useless. If you're in a boss fight, you cannot increase it again because it's based off of kills. The smallest thing can count as a hit too, like a singular tracking dart.\n\nThe resurrection items are neat, but also fall into annoying. You can get parasites, buy restructures, or buy an item which will resurrect you without wiping the run. Yet for some reason, you aren't given a spawning shield or anything. So while you are paused and it tells you \"Saved by X\" you'll potentially have been grabbed or taken dmg from anything in the area.\n\nSome of the guns are really good, and some of them are straight dog. Assault Rifle, hell yes! Electric Web Shooter, who the fuck thought of this? Making some weapons a must pick, and others an avoid at all costs. Most levels encourage you to have a fast shooting, low time to kill weapon. But for some reason the late game weapons are just projectile based slow ass weapons that you want to avoid because you've already progressed the earlier weapons more and they don't do enough damage for their rate of fire. Making it increasingly hard to get a good weapon you enjoy, and goes where you shoot, deals reasonable damage, and has fun upgrades. Which need to be unlocked.\n",

Last time I played this, my buddies and I were all passing the controller around like the days before Xbox Live became a thing, laughing at each others misfortune and cheering successes. Have gone full m&kb for a while so trying to play with the controller was difficult but didn't take away the fun. Finally it's on Steam!\n\nNow for the actual game review:\n\nGameplay felt more drawn out on console, resulting in a feeling of prolonged content, perhaps because I was struggling with a controller. On m&kb Returnal feels much easier by comparison. Almost blew through the three stages in my first run! Have given the tower several tries which is loads of fun and tried a weapon quest.\n\nI still plan on playing more but overall it doesn't feel like a $60 game.  My opinion as of right now is to wait until Returnal is on sale for at least $40. \n\nHighly polished gameplay, a \"meh\" story, I really enjoy this game. Can't wait to try some coop. Hope this review helps!",
