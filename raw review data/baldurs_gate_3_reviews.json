        "review": "I'm recommending this because, as a game, it's pretty good. I don't consider it a worthy successor to the Baldur's Gate franchise though. I dislike the four character party when the original was six. I absolutely hate the fact that not one single companion is likable. Even the combat mechanics seem, well... more mechanical rather than organic like the original. It could be the fact that they're using the new D&D rules (not a fan. I'm very old school on D&D) but whatever it is, it's not making me want to play it again to try other character builds or anything like that. I had a feeling, when it was first announced that Larian was going to be making it, that I would be disappointed so I waited until it was on sale to buy it. And I was right; it's disappointing if you're expecting anything remotely Baldur's Gate. Just play it like an unrelated game and it's fine.",

Even if you do not know anything about D&D but know any of the games mentioned above, you will love this game as much as I do. I am talking about my opinion; you may disagree. I wasn't planning to purchase a new game. Upon a recommendation from a friend, I watched lots of videos on the internet, and decided to buy it. So far, I've played 13+ hours in two days. This game offers everything I love about the games mentioned above and has its own welcome additions. Thanks to LS and the Dev Team.",

This game is trying so hard to be the BOTW of CRPGs but fails really short with shallow story and forced gimmicks. The romance options are just useless addition. I am staunch believer of if something doesnt add value, it shouldnt exist, and romance option in this game shouldnt. It exists for sole purpose of tick-marking a feature. It might look like I am picking up one one specific thing but its just one example out of literally everything in the game that exists just for sake of existence. There is no cohesion or clear vision. This game has been a star of media and loud fan echo, but outside that, it just falls short. A waste of time, that I poured into it as i never want to judge a piece of art before investing enough effort into understanding it. A 7/10 maybe, a 10/10, no .",

The graphics are absolutely stunning, my game is absolutely stacked with mods that work fantastic and add ~flavor~, and the storyline and characters are so versatile. The one downside I will say concerns the game files interactions with mods when updated. Ive spent at LEAST 20 hours crying and trying to get my error 302 and 117 away, but once you figure it out everythings fine. Please get this game, you wont regret it!!!!\r\nAlso justice for Wyll lmaooooooooooo",

        "review": "[h1] Resumo [/h1]\r\nBaldurs Gate 3 foi o meu game of the year de 2023, o jogo conta com uma historia muito boa e que só cresce quanto mais voce investe nos companions, os companions são muito bem construidos e o investimento no acting dele é absurdo. O combat segue o mesmo padrão de D&D 5e com alguns tweeks, sendo muito divertido e permitindo varias combinações de times.  O mapa e o grafíco do jogo também são lindos, o jogo só não tira nota maxíma por problemas de perfomance no ato 3, e ainda o ato 3 parece ter sido feito as pressas comparado com os outros atos. Mas de forma geral um jogo incrível que mereceu o jogo do ano e espero que sirva como inspiração para RPGs no futuro. \r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Nota [/h1]\r\n[b] 97/100 [/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1] Exploração[/h1]\r\nO jogo oferece 3 areas principais com muita coisa para ver e explorar dentro delas e diversas sub-areas, muitos segredos e varias mini historias espalhadas pelos mapas. O jogo explora bem principalmente a primeira região costeira de feirun, tendo algumas vilas, grooves, pantanos, underdark e mais só no primeiro mapa, a medida que os atos vão passando as regiões diferem bastante da anterior assim deixando uma sensação de algo novo a cada mudança de mapa. E nesse quesito o jogo não peca, vale a pena explorar e explorar varias vezes com companios e origens diferentes para ter acesso a mais segredos. \r\n\r\n[h1] Quests e Historia [/h1]\r\nAs quests de Baldurs gate variam tremendamente, podem ser uma quest bem engraçada e curta como tambem pode ser uma quest onde voce só consegue ver os resultados e consequencias 2 atos depois. Elas estão muito bem escritas e o mais impressionante são os NPCs eles tem personalidade e suas motivaçoes fazem voce ter curiosidade para fazer cada quest que conseguir ecnontrar. Os companions reagem ao que voce faz e as quests e escolhas, eles tomam as proprias tambem o que faz o jogo ter um certo dinamismo, em um determinado momento voce pode se encontrar com uma escolha que para voce o jogar seja obvia mas ela vai de encontro com a moral ou a personalidade de algum companion e isso traz resultados diversos a cada run. \r\n\r\nO jogo te permite andar a campanha como um novo personagem criado por voce ou seguir as origens de cada um dos companions, cada origem permite diversos finais e mostra partes da historia e o ponto de vista desse companion em determinados eventos que voce não teria acesso de outra forma, te permite tambem explorar de forma mais fiel as motivações deles. \r\n\r\n[h1] Acting [/h1]\r\nO jogo conta com um voice acting and motion capture de dar inveja e espero que sirva de inspiração para o resto da industria, os companions tem personalidades que voce pode odiar ou amar, as relações são muito creveis, eles conversam entre si, eles comentam, eles tem raiva, eles amam, eles tem conflitos e tudo isso só acrescenta na imersão que o jogo proporciona. \r\n\r\n[h1] Combate [/h1]\r\nO combate do jogo é feito em cima do combate de D7D 5e porem com algumas modificações da Larian para deixar mais fluito e mais acessivel a jogadores iniciantes. de forma geral o combate agrada, ele é dinamico, e tem muita abertura para diferentes estrategias, composiçoes de time e usar o ambiente como ferramenta ou as particularidades dos inimigos é algo comum e encorajado pelo jogo. Sendo assim bem agradavel. \r\nComparando com Divinity original sin 2, eu prefiro o combate de divinity 2 por ser mais dinamico e explosivo, porem o combate em baldurs gate tem sua particularidade e seu charme e entrega uma gameplay divertida. \r\n\r\n[h1] Classes & Builds[/h1]\r\nO jogo tem uma quantidade razoavel de classes e subclasses tiradas de D&D 5e, agradando a varios gostos e estilos de jogos diverentes, permitindo muitas composiçoes algumas completamente quebradas. O que é otimo, o jogo permite que voce builde em cima de uma habilidade ou arma especifica, permite combinar varias classicas com multiclass e traz uma infinidade de builds, basta passar alguns minutos procurando na internet e voce vai se deparar com um mar, com a introdução aos mods da comunidade essas possibilidades aumentaram ainda mais. Eu particularmente gosto bastante de fazer builds e consegue criar algumas bem divertidas e diferentes em 3 runs diferentes. \r\n\r\nGOTY\r\n\r\n",

I'm a casual gamer, a stardew valley girl if you will...Genshin when I want a challenge, but I really wanted to try this because I've always been interested. I don't have anybody in my life who is as nerdy as I am with this stuff, so I went in blind.\r\n\r\nMistake 1.\r\n\r\nMistake 2? Trying to brute force things. \r\n\r\nOnce I lowered the level to basically easy, peasy, I fell in love with this! The stories are cool. The endless choices are also really unique. Character creation is slightly limited with facial features, but SUPER detailed elsewhere. Another tip? Use the environment and scrolls to your advantage. Give the game a fair chance, I had to come back after a few months because that hag murdering me and my entire squad. \r\n\r\nSuper fun, decent graphics, can't wait to up the difficulty for a challenge now that I semi understand the mechanics.",

My Steam Deck spends more time churning and trying to patch a game than it affords me in game time. If you're buying this game to play on the Steam Deck, DO NOT! You will be beyond disappointed when you are staring at the Downloads screen for ***DAYS*** at a time. I wonder if this continuous misrepresentation of the ability for the hardware to handle the game sufficiently will result in another class action.",

I had heard of Baldur's Gate in passing but never really thought much of it. But on her recommendation I picked it up because she wanted to do a campaign with our friend group and just have a good time. \r\n\r\nThis started a long series of me playing this game in every way possible to get the full experience. Don't be fooled by my 87 hour time, that's just for PC, my PlayStation clocked me at 480 hours. Even now, with as much detail as this game is crammed full of, I still continue to see new things, find characters I've never met, and have interactions I've never seen before. Every campaign is a new experience and finding new ways to break the game has been my longstanding goal.\r\n\r\nThe sheer variety of experience has made this my favorite game of all time, and I cannot recommend it enough. If you're on the fence, make the leap, you won't regret it.",

Unbeatable storyline, dialogue, voice acting, quests, graphics, romance. The gameplay isn't half bad either. Some mild changes from 5e D&D, not necessarily for the better (so many magic items), but whatever. It's still good.\r\n\r\nOnly drawback is that it isn't getting any DLC because Hasbro and WotC are idiots, but Larian can hardly be faulted for that.\r\n\r\nExcellent game. Take your time and enjoy it. Multiple times, even.",

        "review": "Finally finished it! What a journey! A great game overall, but there are a few bits here and there that I found a bit annoying, puzzling or more generally below par.\r\n-My main grievance is that it's not possible to change level in the \"world\" map, which makes moving from one location to the other more complicated than it should be, especially for people like me who may have several days between two sessions. Also, the fact that it's not possible to point-click on the map to have the characters move to a certain location, or to visualise a certain area without having the characters move there. All things that were available 24 years in BG2 (just saying).\r\n-The limit to 4 characters looked at odds with the 6 party members allowed in BG1 and BG2 (and judging by how well the party limit removal mod worked, I wonder what was the issue with a 6-member party).\r\n-Some bits in Act 3 (particularly) look like like unfinished business. One might argue that they are to create \"ambience\", but that's not the feeling I get in most cases. And what's the deal with regular arrows that one finds here and there on mountain pass?\r\n-The romance system looks a bit (a lot?) \"pushed\". Although it's flattering that all the male characters in my party fall madly in love with me, it does sound look a bit odd. Most of the time, it felt like \"Hello, nice to meet you, I'm XYZ, your new NPC party member. Would you like to sleep with me at the next long rest?\".\r\n-Some cutscenes in the Shadowheart romance are only activated in very specific circumstances, of which no clue is given, and they required a lot of (uncessary?) research and attempts to unlock.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I really enjoyed it, thanks Larian!",

        "review": "Story and Setting:\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, bringing players to the rich and intricate world of the Forgotten Realms. The story kicks off with your character infected by a parasitic tadpole implanted by Mind Flayers, setting the stage for a tale of survival, choices, and transformation. The stakes are high as your party searches for a cure, navigating through factions, dangerous magic, and personal dilemmas.\n\nThe narrative is deep, multi-layered, and full of moral gray areas. Choices feel impactful and affect the plot, relationships, and the world around you. Larian Studios excels in creating complex, branching storylines, and Baldur’s Gate 3 is no exception. Characters in your party have rich backstories, and getting to know them can lead to powerful moments, betrayals, or even romance.\n\nGameplay:\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 combines turn-based combat (inspired by Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules) with classic CRPG exploration. The combat system is strategic, offering numerous possibilities depending on class abilities, spell usage, and environmental interactions. Larian’s signature use of the environment adds creativity to encounters—you can shove enemies off ledges, ignite oil spills, or manipulate the terrain to your advantage.\n\nOutside combat, the game leans heavily on choice and consequence. Every dialogue option, skill check, or action can ripple into broader consequences in the world. With hundreds of dialogue paths and outcomes, the game feels uniquely tailored to your playstyle. There’s immense freedom in how you approach problems—whether you’re sneaking past enemies, talking your way out of danger, or brute-forcing through obstacles.\n\nVisuals and Presentation:\n\nGraphically, Baldur’s Gate 3 is stunning. The environments are detailed and vibrant, from the dark, dangerous caverns to the bustling cities filled with life. Characters are expressive, and the motion-captured animations during dialogues add a cinematic flair to conversations. The voice acting is top-notch, with every character brought to life with distinct personality and emotion.\n\nThe soundtrack is evocative, enhancing the sense of wonder, danger, and discovery that fills the Forgotten Realms. It shifts beautifully between atmospheric exploration music and intense, pulse-pounding battle themes.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nOne of the unique features of Baldur’s Gate 3 is its multiplayer mode. You can play the entire campaign with friends, each controlling a different character in the party. This brings a tabletop-like feel to the experience, where cooperative (or even competitive) role-playing enhances the dynamic. Multiplayer adds a new layer of unpredictability, as friends might make choices that drastically alter the game’s trajectory.\n\nReplayability:\n\nWith its myriad choices, branching paths, and multiple endings, Baldur’s Gate 3 has immense replay value. No two playthroughs are the same—different character builds, party compositions, and decisions lead to wildly different outcomes. Even if you think you’ve seen it all, starting a new game with a different class or making alternative choices can feel like a fresh experience.\n\nCriticisms:\n\nOne minor critique could be the complexity of the systems, which might feel overwhelming to newcomers unfamiliar with D&D mechanics or turn-based strategy. The game also has some minor technical bugs and performance issues, though these have been largely addressed in patches.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is a monumental RPG, combining the deep storytelling of classic CRPGs with modern visuals and mechanics. It’s a game that respects the player’s agency, providing a vast, reactive world where every decision matters. Whether you’re a fan of Dungeons & Dragons, turn-based combat, or narrative-driven games, Baldur’s Gate 3 offers an unforgettable experience.\n\nRating: 9.5/10",

My first character was a Paladin Knight under earlier D&D editions (Advanced D&D).  When Baldur's Gate, the first version, I didn't lean toward CRPG because there was Ultimate Online and Everquest.   However, what BG3 did is to help me understand 5th Edition D&D.  I didn't know how much depth there was.  BG3 and subsequent modding tools will be an official challenger to Skyrim.  Both CRPGS are worth of your time, but BG3 has a Ready to Serve option and more depth of characters.  Enjoy.",

That doesn't mean every gamer will appreciate it to the same degree, for instance if you're not interested in the idea of medieval role playing games, patient decision making, narrative moments, D&D in general, or the D&D rule set.  What this game does, is hit the exact bullseye for what it was meant to be, and I find it so impressive.",

Each of the characters are flawed and your decisions help shape them and the future of them. Every decision and interaction can change, and in sooooo many ways. I have played games where you play good or evil and those are the two stories, but this one has so many possibilities that even playing back to back 'good' play throughs I have had different outcomes. Plus enjoying the randomness of the roll of the dice, sure you could just go back to a save (make sure you save ALOT) but it is kind of fun to just let the dice decide and it will be what it will be ya know? I highly recommend the game.",

Scared you're not going to pass your perception check? That's ok, some of the \"fail\" options give you a more fun and action-packed adventure anyway so don't worry your little head. It'll all be okay. Just sit back, relax, screw your favourite vampire and let the negative energy dissipate. 10/10 would get a worm in my head again!",

        "review": "“All the victories on the battlefield are just the outset. Just the beginning... you can bet your life on that. I will get my own kingdom.” (Berserk)\n\nI played Griffith from Berserk (bard-paladin-fighter multiclass) as Dark Urge and made Casca my dream guardian. Griffith's goal is to achieve his dream, to have his own kingdom, no matter the cost. He is also destined to take a place in the ranks of God Hand (Baal). \nDuring the game, I saved innocents while simultaneously committing terrible acts. As a bard, I could inspire my companions in battles against bosses (apostles) and influence people when I needed it. To achieve the Slayer Form (Femto), I sacrificed an innocent creature. The abilities of the illithid reflect the desire for absolute power. I gathered an army of people and monsters to lead in the final battle for this dream. The bond between Griffith and his companions became something truly special, but in the end he betrayed them for his own dream. Then we had two options: seize power over the kingdom and rule everyone, or sacrifice the entire world along with our companions, then walk under the Eclipse!\n\nAs for the game itself:\n- The plot is interesting and has many choices, endings and encounters from previous games.\n- Every companion is unique and offer a different vibe.\n- DnD mechanics bring amazing variety and flexibility, resulting in complex and dynamic combat.\n- The art design of the characters, their armor, the city, and other locations is breathtaking. The artists did an amazing job and it is impossible to imagine more authentic characters and environments.\n- The voice actors are incredible!\n\nOverall, it is one of the greatest fantasy games ever and an outstanding spiritual successor to previous games!",

However, suddenly my friend showed us his pet octopus and out of nowhere John Baldur shouted, \"It's Baldur's time!\" then started Eldritch Blasting everyone around. After that, he grabbed my hand, ran toward my friend's front gate, and gave me exactly three copies of Baldur's Gate 3, said it's now my time to do the Balduring. Pretty swell of him, ngl.",

This game would benefit highly from a definitive edition, a recut, an expansion, or any other number of things that Larian has confirmed that they will never be producing. Oh well. Some companion questlines conclude in really dumb or unsatisfying ways but the journey is worthwhile. I'll be adding this one to BG1 and BG2 in my \"games that I definitely have a normal amount of time in please don't ask\" list.",

        "review": "Baldur's Gate 3 is an exceptional game that blends traditional RPG elements with modern game design in a way that feels both fresh and familiar. One of the game's strongest aspects is how it allows players to make meaningful choices that have lasting consequences. Every decision, whether in dialogue, combat, or exploration, can significantly impact the course of the story, making it clear that your choices genuinely matter.\n\nThe gameplay itself is engaging, with a combat system that requires strategy and careful planning. The exploration is vast and rewarding, with countless secrets to uncover and side quests to pursue. The companions you meet along the way are well-developed, each bringing their own perspectives, skills, and personalities to the group. And, while I may be biased, I must say that Shadowheart is a standout character—arguably the best companion in the game.\n\nIn summary, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game that offers depth, challenge, and a high degree of player agency. It provides a rich, immersive experience where your actions directly influence the world around you. If you enjoy role-playing games that offer a strong narrative and the freedom to shape the story, this game is well worth your time.",

BG3 takes this concept and ramps it up to 11, with potentially 10 recruitable characters, plus Tav or the Dark Urge, all interacting with eachother and the chopices the player makes. It may be a little fan service-y that every character is canonically pansexual, but it hardly takes anything away from the interactions in game.\r\nThe story in this game is the only thing that isnt a 10/10 for me, with the whole thing feeling very predictable, if the party had just been hired to fight the act 2 boss, then been infected, the story might have flowed a little better, with act 3 feeling more a part of the story and less like a debug room full of unused missions.\r\nRegardless, amazing game 9.5/10 would recommend to anyone",

I have never played any Baldurs Gate games and thus, this is my first. It is incredible to say the least. Full of risk, choices, strategy, and a great story. If this is your first Baulder's Gate game, this is a great place to start.",

Bought the game to play with friends, and it just constantly has problems playing multiplayer. There are never useful error messages. Sometimes people just cannot connect, and if they get an error message at all it is just generic. Sometimes the play session can bug out and the game continues to run, but you cannot actually do anything. If you play with four people you give up the ability to do anything with the companions because they need to be in the party and you can only have 4 people in the party. Ultimately what triggered the negative review is that our last session ended with a cut scene waiting to be played at camp, and because of that we were unable to use that save. Fortunately I save very often due to the plethora of problems we have encountered so it does not really set us back, but it is none the less ridiculous.\n\nBasically, the multiplayer just feels like a last minute addition that barely bother to support. It is shameful for a game to have this price point, have made this much money, and still have these problems.\n\nIf single player is your thing? I'm sure it's great. If multiplayer is why you're looking at buying it, save yourself the frustration.",

It breaks my heart that rumors are Larian will not be continuing in the making of Baldur's Gate content, because the bar has been set astronomically high for whatever comes next.

Beautiful scenes, great characters and lovely voice acting. But it just didn't click with me like I thought it would. I like other turn based combat games, but everything here was very detailed, thorough and complex, which made it overwhelming. I understand the nature of DND involves having to make decisions every other moment, but to me it got tedious. I prefer a game that tells it's own story that I get to experience, rather than having to make it myself. I will return to this game one day when I have the time and patience.",

You can do it, I save scum because I am new to the game but it has a WHOLE lot to it. I look forward to playing without save scumming after I win my first campaign. Paladin was my hero choice but there is a whole lot of customization which is possible! Highly recommend, even to those who are unsure. Just take the game for a spin on a long night and spend some time.. you will certainly enjoy! Risque scenes are almost inevitable too!",

Every inch of the game is packed with content. It's hard to [i]not[/i] constantly stumble into interesting situations. Story, characters, graphics, world, music, sound, voice acting - it's all great. It all combines to create a rich world, dripping with artistry. \n\nThe gameplay is solid - it is fairly similar to DnD5e in structure, and should be well familiar if you've dabbled in such before. The DNA of Larian's older games like Divinity Original Sin is very palpable too, and this game will feel very familiar if you've played that series. There are plenty of character customization options, and you are free to reroll your class/build or change your appearance during the course of the game if you so wish. During the game you'll follow the game's story, and find quests and challenges on the way. There are conversations, combat, exploration, skill challenges in dialogue or in the world, etc. Typicaly CRPG fare, but extremly well produced. \n\nIf you're a completionist, then this game is gargantuan - this may be one of the longest single-player/co-op games I've ever played. Despite the length, I enjoyed every second.",

Barely anything truly overarches anymore, 99 of NPCs are generic one liners that dont fit in. It is completely disconnected to the first 2 brilliant acts. My dissapointment is great, every interaction just leads to a fight without any interesting happening. Characters have lost all of their personality, everything feels generic and misplaced. \r\n\r\nI am the type to skip cutscenes and rarely read text in roleplay games, but the first two acts got me reading EVERYTHING. Act 3.... i am wasting my time looking for a single good item lying around with a hidden mystery or clue. \r\n\r\nEnd of act 2 I was mesmerized and planning my next move, act 3 i feel myself desperately trying to finish my enormous todo list.  Its like eating the best pizza in the world and getting dogshit for dessert. Ruins the flavour of the pizza.",

While the visuals may not be the absolute best, overall game is pretty, detailed and has its cinematic moments in few places, does it have the best storyline? also, not really.. I mean it is gripping and I like how it is all connected, but you can see drop in quality of game content in act 3, quests and especially side quests in this section of the game often felt like chores (probably they are designed more with the intention to get you to level 12), the city itself doesn't grab that much of attention. What I mean about that is that, we are taking a walk to THE city of Baldur's Gate for 40-50 hours (that is, if you are deciding to complete every quest and visit every location) especially after act 2 I was very hyped to finally reach it and see what else is wating there for me but it fell flat, somehow there is a ton of content but most of it is lackluster, not intresting or simply just too common, imagine that through eyes of player's character, what he has done and what is he doing now. A big plus for variaty of endings and a huge one for implementing things that consumers wanted, Im not gonna spoil it but if you know you know. The bread and butter of this game are companions, choices with actual consequences, huge replayability value, rich dnd lore behind locations, factions ect. dialogues choices and unique interactions from races and classes are flaverfull and can actually change gameplay in small ways. Overall you can see that developers put a lot of heart to this game, and now with modding tools and support from Larian's we are able to improve on already well done game (9.5/10)",

        "review": "I am not one to typically play very long games or get heavily invested in any one game. That all changed with Baldur's Gate III. I'm on my way to completing my second playthrough and I fully intend to do more. The game gives you so many complex options - whether you want to be the good guy, the bad guy, or just a chaotic freak trying any and every insane idea that pops into your head. The options are near limitless. Both of my playthroughs have been so dramatically different based on small nuances and finding previously unknown locations - also there is additional content depending upon if you are playing as an origin character or one of your own creation. The cinematics are beautiful, the soundtrack and sound design are gorgeous, the voice acting is some of the best in the business and the writing - I can't tell you how many times this game has moved me to tears! I also love the romance options. I bought the game because I had Covid during pride and was bored - and as a queer person, just seeing so many diverse relationships naturally in-world really made me burst with happiness. The game also does polyamory in a thoughtful way as well as offering multiple perspectives on sex work, which I appreciated. The characters make you care deeply for them and want to probe into their story lines - even provoking empathy for the ones you hate! I just adore this game and it's given me countless hours of joy. I would buy it a thousand times over (in fact I've now bought everything Larian has ever released). Thank you, Larian, for making a game that far exceeded most people's expectations in this terrible, exploitative modern gaming climate. The love this game gets is merely a reflection of the ample love that was put into its creation. Can't wait for my next run and for whatever else is on the horizon for Larian!",

The dialogue actually matters—every choice feels impactful, and your followers' comments seamlessly blend into the conversations, unlike in Starfield where their input often feels irrelevant. The world and its characters interact almost perfectly, making every encounter feel dynamic and meaningful.\r\n\r\nConversations with your party members aren't dry or repetitive like in Skyrim or Starfield; instead, they’re rich, engaging, and full of personality. The world is as open and immersive as Skyrim, but with far more depth and complexity than anything I’ve played before. Every choice and interaction shapes the story in a way that feels natural, making it one of the most alive and intricate RPG experiences out there.",

Larian Studios has managed to create an incredibly immersive and richly detailed world that stays true to the spirit of classic Dungeons & Dragons while pushing the boundaries of modern gaming.\n\nFrom the moment you start, you're drawn into a deep narrative filled with compelling characters, intricate storylines, and moral choices that genuinely impact the game's direction. The dialogue system is one of the best I've seen, giving players the freedom to shape their character's personality and relationships in meaningful ways. The voice acting and cinematic cutscenes elevate the experience to new heights, making you feel like you're part of an epic fantasy movie.\n\nThe turn-based combat is tactical and rewarding, offering plenty of depth without becoming overwhelming. The variety of ways you can approach situations—whether through brute force, stealth, persuasion, or magic—adds a layer of strategy that keeps the gameplay fresh throughout.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and spell effects is remarkable. Every location feels alive and atmospheric, from the dark corners of an ancient dungeon to the bustling streets of a city.\n\nWhat truly sets Baldur's Gate 3 apart is the sense of freedom it gives the player. You're not just following a set path but truly forging your own adventure. Whether you're a fan of D&D or a newcomer to the series, this game is a must-play for anyone who loves a rich narrative, strategic gameplay, and a world that feels alive with possibility.\n\nOverall, Baldur's Gate 3 is an incredible achievement that sets a new standard for RPGs. It's a game that begs to be replayed, as your choices shape a unique experience each time.",

        "review": "The game is good but it is massively OVERHYPED. Giving it a negative review just to balance out all the unreasonable \"best game ever\" reviews.\n\nIf all you care about is story then yes, BG3 is probably one of the best or the best story game of the decade. In a lot of other aspects however falls short.\n\nWhere it falls short? A lot of areas actually.\n\nCombat. I played both Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2 and the combat is much better in those games. This is mot likely due to the DnD ruleset. In previous Larian games you had more spells to manipulate the environment. Where are all the CC abilities? I am lvl 4 I dont even have a spell which can freeze enemies. No casting rain and then electrifying it with lightning bolt. I checked all the available spells in the game and in DOS 1 and DOS 2 they are way more impactful.\n\nCombat UI: not intuitive. Especially when you want to use potions or scrolls. \n\nWokeness. I am not overly sensitive in this topic but comon. Astarion (the sexy vampire boy) looks straight up gay to me. I support the LGBTI community but I dont understand why it needs to be forced into games. I am sure this came from Hasbro.\n\nNarration. The narrator does a great job however her voice is not pleasant to listen to. In my opinion it was a bad choice and it hurts the game. I am sure there are other professional narrators with a pleasant voice Larian could have hired. In DOS 1 and DOS 2 I had no problems with voice acting.\n\nCharacter progression: It is a mess. Again of you know DnD probably it is easy for you but if you dont you have no idea what you get when your character levels up. The game does a poor job in explaining what is the difference between each class and what you get at level up.\n\nInventory management/crafting: Straight up terrible. It was bad also in DOS1 and DOS2. It is unfortunate that Larian did not improve it. You have so much clutter at all times in your inventory and every character has its own inventory. When you search for a particular item you have no idea who has it. Same with crafting. You have no clue what ingredients to look for etc.\n\nAll in all the story of BG3 is probably 10/10 but every other aspect is at best 8/10. Conclusion. If you dont care that much about the story but you are looking for fine-tuned game systems and a deep tactical combat DOS 2 is much better.",

        "review": "A few weeks ago I finished my (first?) playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3, on normal/balanced difficulty. I have not played the Dark Urge playthrough yet, so some of this stuff might not apply. Overall, while the game has its issues (what game doesn't?), I loved the experience of playing it and recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying it. It replicates D&D surprisingly well, and allows the player a fair bit of creativity and leniency to do what they want. Baldur's Gate 3 will leave you wanting more.\r\n\r\nLets start with the pros:\r\nThe story is immersive. I rarely found myself with nothing to do, its absolutely jam-packed with things to do in every act of the game. I racked up many hours just exploring and trying to exhaust NPC dialog, which there are probably hundreds... Of course, most don't have much to say or have much you can do with them, but its cool that you can hear what they have to say. The story leaves room for you to be creative in most cases, and make your own decisions that actually impact the story in a unique and personalized way. In a lot of ways, it really captures that Dungeons & Dragons experience.\r\nMost combat scenarios require strategy to win, sometimes it would take me hours to get through a particularly hard fight. Despite being more of a roleplayer in typical D&D, I found combat to be enjoyable and stimulating. Another great thing is that if you're one of those people who don't like combat or even prefer it, the game gives you different difficulties to choose from and has even recently added custom difficulty options. This makes it possible to focus more on the story if that's what you care more about, or allows you harder fights to put more work and thought into if you'd prefer.\r\nI was extremely impressed with the amount of leniency and creativity the game allows you. This also applies to the character creator. The game gives you lots of options for character customization, ranging from skin colors to horn types to scars. And if you decide you want to change your character later on, you are given the option to tweak their appearance using a special item at your camp whenever you want.\r\nIt goes without saying that the visuals in this game are magnificent. The music and sound design were easy to fall in love with as well. I could not count how many times the camp music or the combat music got stuck in my head (often making me wish I was playing the game instead of trying to fall asleep at the end of the day.) The voice acting was great as well, making every NPC feel like a real person.\r\nThe multiplayer is decent. It's not the same as playing D&D with real people, most interactions are separate and there isn't a whole lot you can do with each other's characters other than traveling and fighting together, but it's a fun time. I liked making decisions together as a group. I think multiplayer even improves combat in a lot of ways (which makes sense, one player isn't supposed to control a whole party by themselves in typical D&D combat). It was just more rewarding and fun for me fighting with other people who controlled their own characters.\r\nI found myself so attached to my player character and the NPCs, that by the end of the game I was sad and didn't want it to end. They all felt so alive, like I was saying goodbye to friends. I just wanted it to keep going. This wasn't because the game was lacking, but because the experience was rewarding that I just wasn't ready for it to be over. I thought the ending wrapped things up nicely... I loved the epilogue... but it was bittersweet. Playing until the end, avoiding spoilers this whole time, proved to be worth it to me.\r\n\r\nLets move on to the cons:\r\nOne of my biggest pet peeves about this game involves the character creator. You have all these options for customization like skin colors and freckle intensity, but only four body types that aren't adjustable... There's two skinny options and two muscular options, one each for male and female. I just feel like with all the effort and love that was put into this game and all its little details, it is really disappointing that more love wasn't put into that. That's a pretty big flaw considering how many hours you'll be spending with your character while beating the game...\r\nSpeaking of hours, I would definitely say that the length of this game isn't for everyone. I don't consider it a \"flaw\" or a \"con\" necessarily, but some people may be intimidated by the amount of time you have to pour into the game just to beat it once... I would say it's a con for someone who prefers shorter games or feels like they don't have the time.\r\nThis game can also be heavy on performance. Its a huge game, so no surprise there... but it does make my computer sound like an airplane and feel like an oven. In some of the bigger areas of the game, it can take awhile for all the textures and buildings and stuff to be loaded in once you open the game and there would be some lag sometimes depending on the area I was in or what scenario/interaction I was having. While I feel like this stuff is a fair trade-off for a beautiful game that is basically open world, some people may have a harder time playing it or running it because of that. Messing with settings may help it be easier on computers, but it's best played on a gaming computer.\r\nAnother one of my big pet peeves for this game is that the NPC AI can be really irritating. Its so frustrating when I'm trying to be sneaky, and my companions wander onto traps and everyone takes damage (or dies) or wander into combat before I'm ready. There are also times when a companion decides not to follow me when I have to jump over things and I'll be far away from them by the time I realize they hadn't been following me this whole time and now I need to go get them. It can also be frustrating when I walk into a cutscene but because my companion managed to reach the NPCs first by being slightly ahead of me, I have to use them for dialog and rolls/saves. During combat, sometimes enemy NPCs freeze up and take a long time to do their actions/turn, sometimes as long as a few minutes. I'll be waiting so long for them to do whatever they're gonna do and by the time it actually happens, I'm sitting there thinking \"Wait, what was I going to do again?\" I'd say generally the AI is fine, but it does have its frustrating and annoying moments.\r\nSome of the movements in cutscenes (and especially full-body scenes) were a little awkward and strange, breaking immersion sometimes. Sometimes I found myself thinking that the characters looked a little like aliens who are trying to replicate human interaction for the first time. Also the occasional bug where one of my companions had dialog about something that already happened as if it were happening in the moment we were speaking, was a little jarring at times.\r\nWhile this game does give you a surprising amount of leniency and nurtures the creativity of its players, there is a limit. Sometimes the game just cannot work with an idea that is too creative, that hypothetically should work. There were many times where I thought I came up with a solution to a problem only for it to not work, even though the real solution ended up being similar enough to my idea that it should have worked. This isn't really the fault of the game, everything in this was planned out because it is a video game, but it still can be frustrating when you compare these moments to what would happen during a D&D session. This also applies to having to choose between set dialog options for your character. Even though you might feel like \"Hey, my character wouldn't say any of these!\" you still have to pick one to get through the interaction. Baldur's Gate 3 is pretty close to D&D in a lot of ways, but there's just only so much it can do when you're the only real person involved. \r\n\r\nOverall, most of my cons were more nitpicky than anything. Its a great experience, highly recommend it.",

It sets out to do what it sought to do in such a clear and passionate manner that I can't help but think that it is perhaps the greatest fantasy RPG of all time. It is for me.\r\n\r\nThe only genuine complaints I have is that the party member lineup leans very heavily human or elf with only a Tiefling and Gith to break it up, where a goblin or kobold party member would have added some much-needed variety, and I object to the handling of two returning characters in Act 3 who act so wildly out of character compared to their BG1 and 2 counterparts that they seem like entirely different characters. \r\n\r\nEven still, this is in my top three games of all time, if not my number one.",

It may not be a 10, but it is an astounding 9.6. What a story and what characters. The personality, the immersion, the challenge, the everything. The replayablity. I am already creating my next character for a new playthrough in the hopes of exploring just a tiny notch more of what this game has to offer. Even if you struggle with RPGs as I have with some, this is deserving of every prize, good review, and minute of your life for the next few months.",

        "review": "I have been gaming since I was a toddler. This game contends for the spot of the greatest game I've ever played.\nReasonably, some of that is because the game is literally the digital medium for one of the greatest games ever designed, (Dungeons and Dragons), but that in no way minimizes the triumph that is Baldur's Gate 3.\nThe art is gorgeous, the voice acting is phenomenal, the story is compelling, the combat system is creative and exciting, the world building is extraordinary, the puzzles are difficult, and the story is yours to manipulate. \nI casually and methodically explored every inch of the game, and when I returned for a second play through, there were things I missed! Not only do I get the joy of a 'new and similar' story, but I also have the joy of finding MORE secrets. \nThe first time I found a hidden switch and it revealed a hidden passageway I felt an indescribable thrill! Exploring, creative thinking, role playing, strategy; this game is packed full of enjoyment!\nI have recommended this game to many of my friends, and even those of whom I expected less interest LOVED the game. I find my friends and family members sometimes playing ALL DAY, which is unusual.\n\nI purchased this game on my account, and upon request from my wife, immediately refunded it and purchased it on her account instead, which explains my low-hour playtime score. In reality, I've played about 350 hours on her account, and at my next convenience, I'll be re-purchasing the game on my own account so we can play in tandem.\nFor those curious how long the game is: it depends. My brother, (who moves quickly), finished the game in approximately 60 hours. I took my time and completed \"everything\", looted everything, talked to nearly everyone, and I completed the game in something like 250 hours. Every hour was enjoyment.\nMy main suggestion or hope is that Larian Studios will add a map editor so players can make and share their own campaigns and/or that the studio will release new storylines as DLC. I can't get enough!",

The character arcs Mwah. The voice acting + Graphics 10/10, you computer may lift off though, pro tip use DLSS for more frames so you can max out those graphics settings. The game play was kinda confusing at the beginning, but it is super intuitive, pro tip 10/10 recommend playing with controller, changed my life because WASD doesn't move the character so it feels less open world on keyboard in my opinion. The character designs, hot as balls. The boss battles did make us quiver in our boots though, but we always clocked them. Also be prepared to be in save scum city, this game has some crazy ability checks, so don't follow the advice of the purists, and just save scum if you want to.",

If you are a tabletop DnD player you will be right at home with the combat system, as will veterans of Larian's Divinity: OS Games. It even has multiplayer and mod support.\n\nThis is a one in a lifetime game that many others simply cannot hold a candle to. Highly recommend you check it out!",

Naturally there are other games that are specifically designed for that purpose, but Baldur's Gate and the D&D lore is a mashup of all of them. I will give you two pieces of advice - don't rush it, and don't save-scum. You will make a careful decision based on all the evidence you have on hand, and then immediately realize you misjudged someone's character and now something very bad is happening. Just see it through. You truly never know where the story is going to take you. In other words, let the story tell itself once you've made your decisions, and enjoy the ride.",

I think this is one of the best games I have ever played, and if you aren't normally a lore player, this game might turn you to the other side. The amount of weight your choices have really stand out to me, as someone that plays games like Genshin Impact. Then again, this game is supposed to be a type of digital Dungeons and Dragons, so it makes sense that your actions would have consequences. Seriously, if you've been looking for a game to sink your time into, this game is perfect. 10/10.",

        "review": "I wish I could give an on the fence rating, as this game truly is extremely impressive. But I just want to put this out there for anyone who might be like me.\nI went into this game having heard tales of its dedication to immersion, how every choice mattered, even the small ones. Maybe this set my expectations too high, maybe I was unlucky, but I can confidently say that, at least in my playthrough, this was not the case, at all.\n\nFundamentally, the moment-to-moment dialogue writing is just mediocre. There are memorable and charming characters, but, once you reach past the surface level, nearly every character has the most predictable, bog-standard reaction to every single situation they come across. Very rarely did any of the writing wow me with wit, expression, or character. It doesn't matter what happens, from simple banter to life-changing moments to deaths of loved ones, everything feels like a bland first draft you’d jot down before actually thinking of an interesting or moving way of writing a scene. Dialogue options are very obvious with what interactions they are trying to pull you into, sometimes even presupposing actions that make no sense for anyone involved (knowledge they could not possibly have, or referencing things I never did).\nThis lack of quality sadly extends to the story as a whole. I simply think Larian bit off more than they could chew, as the sheer scope of what they pulled off is unbelievably impressive, but still just not enough for what they were trying to do. Rather than even “just” a 100 hour game with tighter writing and more fleshed out characters, the game is ballooned to such a scale that few things feel fully finished and it leaves the entire experience feeling messy and hollow to me. There are a handful of key character progression points, but beyond those, I rarely had any meaningful connection to my party members. At the end of Act 1, the game suddenly shovels all their character moments on you in quick succession before pulling back again for most of Act 2. Fair enough, we’re in the thick of a dramatic plot, but the generic cultist villains just aren’t nearly as interesting.\nI fully intended to finish the game despite my gripes, but the moment that finally broke me was this one (kept vague for spoiler reasons):\nI was going through a dungeon that was important to one of my party members. They were raving about an ideology that I did not agree with, but every time the game gave me the ability to talk to them about it, the options boiled down to “Your ideology is fucking dumb” and “Yeah, you’re good C:”\nI kept hoping to reach a point where the game would let me genuinely interact with their ideology and their character, but it never happened. I’ve heard there was some flag I could have set beforehand that would have made this character more amiable in this section, but that doesn’t fix my issue. In fact, it makes it worse, confining meaningful character interactions to whether you’ve completed a set scripted quest item is the opposite of immersive (except, it likely wouldn’t have been meaningful. i have reason to believe it would have been just as boring, but the character would have been easier to convince). By the end of the dungeon we reached a major decision point for this character, one that would further cement their ideology or let them break free from it. And once more, I was faced with essentially two options. “Don’t do it, I believe in you :,C” or “Yeah, you’re good C:” I then failed a persuasion check, the character turned hostile, and I was forced to kill them. This is all extremely disappointingly bland, but I could have lived with it.\nHowever. The entire section had no further dialogue at all. Not from any of the other party members, not during the combat sequence, nothing. When I returned to camp afterwards, not a single one of the others had anything to say about the fact that we were just forced to tragically kill one of our friends and compatriots. Not a word of acknowledgment. I realized in that moment that Larian probably didn’t intend for anyone to actually go through with this story beat. Whether they lacked the time or the resources or whatever, I assume they figured players would just reload. Well I hadn’t reloaded once to change story outcomes in the 100 or so hours I had put in because I trusted the game to respect the choices I made. And what’s the point of having die-roll fail cases if I’m not actually meant to go through with them? I’d seen other character deaths go unacknowledged before (like an entire village’s worth of named characters being eradicated. nobody gave a shit. again, probably just figured the players would reload), but not a party member’s. That was one step too far and right then what was left of the immersion I had in this story completely shattered.\nIf you want a videogamey romp through a DnD world, you’ll have a good time. And that is a statement fully without judgment. I had a lot of fun with the combat and exploring the various locations is exciting and rewarding as a massive semi-open-world encounter-filled funhouse.\nBut if you want to be genuinely immersed in the story and characters and feel like your actions are meaningfully impactful, be prepared to potentially be game-ruiningly disappointed depending on what choices you make and how willing you are to look past the gaping holes left in the decision tree.\n\nMinor grrr to end off:\nThe UI is straight up baffling. Randomly, things just won't stack, like you'll have 6 of an item and then just another stack of 2 more identical ones. Sometimes you can then manually stack them, sometimes the game just refuses. You can only send things to camp sometimes. Sometimes you can't mark and send multiple things to other characters or camp. Micromanaging your characters' inventories is a nightmare, especially in combat. Sometimes you can split a stack of potions to send to another party member, sometimes you just can't. I think this all has something to do with whether you’re sending from your main character, I honestly don't remember because it makes so little sense I probably compartmentalized the trauma.\n",

The only nit pick I have is with the ending where not every major character is getting their closure scene, instead we get some random soldier saluting some random statue and shots of random civilians. Also, the companion characters seem to join the protagonist really easily when they have no motivation to. (for example: why would a githiyanki like Lae'zel team up with a human). Recommended!",

        "review": "Baldur's Gate is the accumulation of RPGs the last 30 years and is a marvel of a game.\r\n\r\nIt's the first time I can ever recall being convinced that my party members (side characters) actually feeling alive. They aren't just some generic class you bring for their abilities - They have personlities, depth, lives, and you can feel it all. Some of them are somewhat defined by their class' lore, their deity, or their race, but it's all just one part of the characters as a whole. BG3 manages to make the single most flushed out side characters in video game history. This is partly down to their incredible facial animations, but also due to the amazing writing and brilliant voice acting. The side characters alone is enough reason to pick up BG3 and play it. Haven't even finished Act 1 yet, and Im already over a full 24 hours into the game. Im already thinking about what classes, choices, and alignments I want to go with, on my next playthrough.\r\n\r\nThis game is a masterpiece!\r\n\r\n10/10",

I have dabbled in all sorts of games but always get tired in around 50-60 h in and abandon them. \n\nThis game took over my life, my focus, my existence and kept it for 200h! I have never been this immersed in the story, this surprised in the outcomes and loved the characters more. The final battle left a hole in my heart, kind of like when you finish a big book series and think 'What the heck shall I do now?'. This game was an adventure and it was FUN. I had plenty of time to decide on my battles (as an over-thinker it is amazing perk to have time to make options) and I can honestly say that after I take some time to catch up on real life, I shall go for the next round - It is that good! (pheh, and to think I couldn't get through majority of games with over 60h stories). \n\nIf you are still deciding if it is worth it - I PROMISE IT IS SO WORTH IT. It is one of my regrets in not investing in this game sooner as I was unsure if the hefty price would pay off - I would honestly pay double now.",

        "review": "If more developer studios handled their games and community with the same love, respect, dedication, and humor the way Larian does, we'd truly be living in the golden age of gaming.\n\nAll the praise and the awards are completely deserved. I'm at almost 800 hours at this point and I STILL find things I've never seen before, dialogue I didn't know was there, there are many storylines and classes I've never played and characters I've only seen the surface of, and they're still adding more stuff all the time!\nThe music always makes me want to replay DOS2 again, which I suppose is a very nice side effect, since I do still adore that game with a passion as well. I very much love the fact that they put references to the DOS2 Origin characters in the game, especially in the Deluxe Edition, so finding them fills me with joy every time.\n\nThere's only two things I wish were different with personally, and both of those are minor, very Me-centered things. \nA)- Who stole the Dragonborn's necks? Give them back ;-; (ik ik it's DnD Lore accurate, but still-) \nand B)- For the love of god, let my teammates ride my wildshaped Owlbear/Wolf/Dilophosaur Druid into battle.\nBut what do we have mods for, eh? :D\n\nAll in all, BG3 is a truly fantastic game that just oozes the love and passion that was put into it, and is worth more than every penny spent on it. Every run there's always something you haven't seen, heard, or done.\nI hope Larian continues to bring us masterpieces like this in the future. <3",

        "review": "I loved the game. great game to play unmodded, but after 3 playthroughs, I felt like adding mods. BG3 Mod Manager was my go to. after the patch 7 update, everything I had balanced, everything I had working, absolutely Fucked. Yes, you can run a fresh install, yes you can run mods through the native mod loader now, but what about the mods I did have working? many of which Larian doesn't support. legitimatly, anything they consider 3rd party will prevent the game from launching/starting a new game. I love the intnet behind the added internal mod loader, but not the execution. Skyrim's modding system should be a model for BG3 to follow: internal mods work, external mods work, internal to show and allow for proper use of external mods, as well as support for other mod loaders like BG3MM and Vortex",

        "developer_response": "Hello and thank you for your review. We're sorry you've experienced an issue when playing with mods!\nPatch 7 now gives you the ability to continue playing with third-party mods, alongside supported mods. When you first load a save, you will be prompted with our Verification Window. This gives you information about the mods you have installed and offers you the ability to synchronise mods, as well as informs you of which mods are third-party.\nFor more information on how to navigate this window, our support team has put together this article: https://larian.com/support/faqs/synchronising-mods_116\nThe notification letting you know you have third-party mods installed is only for your information. You can continue to play with third-party mods installed! If any of your third-party mods are not working properly, this might mean they are in need of being updated to be compatible with the latest patch.\nIf you're using BG3MM (an external Mod Manager), we suggest checking for mods that have the ModFixer file in them and disabling them. You can do this by looking out for an icon in the line next to the mod name. When hovering over this icon, it will say, “Has Mod Fixer.”\nThe files for these mods will have to be removed and not just disabled on BG3MM. This is because with Patch 7, the team has fixed what Mod Fixer was, well, fixing, and the file is no longer needed. While the file is now blocked from working to prevent players from experiencing issues, some mods may include ModFixer baked in, as indicated in BG3MM.\nIf the issues persist, please do reach out to our Support Team with this link https://larian.com/support/baldur-s-gate-3#modal and they’ll be more than happy to help you troubleshoot any issues!"

The story, the characters and their development, the dialogue and voice acting, and the soundtrack are all incredible. And the freedom it gives you to explore the story is astounding. Considering the scale of the game, the visuals are respectable, and often still beautiful. The turn-based combat is slow, but very satisfying and leaves a lot of room for strategizing. \r\nIf you enjoy DnD, or other turn and strategy-based games, you will love Baldur's Gate 3.",

As a DnD player, this game is everything I could want and so much more, and has inspired me as a DM to implement new rules that this game has introduced to me. The worldbuilding, the storytelling, the characters, the plot overall, is all absolutely incredible, and I would happily recommend to anyone, DnD fan or not.",

It's incredible that in every single run I do, I discover something I missed last time. Combat can be simple to extremely challenging and strategic. The story has so many options and so much replayability. Truly a world where you can do most anything you want to do.\r\n\r\nThe only main con that this game has is that the character creator is extremely limited and kind of shitty. Not being able to edit my character's face beyond a few standard faces that you then see in the world on NPCs sucks and makes everything feel samey when it doesn't have to. Still can't get over one of the creators saying they hate sliders in character creators. I wanted to edit my character in a dnd game!\r\n\r\nBut still, it's very good, especially if you mod it to give your game more stuff to do in the character creation. If you haven't played it by now, you definitely should get on that.",

It’s like they focused on looking pretty and forgot about making an actually fun game.\r\n\r\nThe characters? Boring. I made an elf wizard, and she felt more like a cardboard cutout than a real character. The dialogue tries too hard to be clever and ends up being cringey. I just wanted to skip most of it.\r\n\r\nThe story is all over the place. I found myself not caring about what was happening at all. It’s filled with twists that feel forced and predictable. I was more frustrated than invested.\r\n\r\nAnd the combat? Don’t even get me started. It’s slow and feels tedious. I had to spend too much time figuring out what to do, and it just wasn’t enjoyable.\r\n\r\nHonestly, if you’re thinking about playing Baldur's Gate 3, save your time and play something else. It’s just not worth the hype. There are way better games out there.",

        "review": "\"The Only Game Where You Can Romance a Bear and Feel Emotionally Conflicted\"\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece in the sense that it lets you live out your wildest fantasies of adventuring, slaying monsters, and, um... dating bears? Yes, this game throws the \"I’ll do anything for love\" trope out the window and sets a new bar for RPG weirdness. And guess what? You will love every second of it.\n\nThe game starts off innocently enough: You're minding your own business when suddenly you're abducted by a squid-faced alien who sticks a wriggly brain parasite in your head. That’s when the party really starts. You gather your ragtag team of morally dubious companions, each one more charming and broken than the last, and embark on a quest to rid yourself of this mind-bending (literally) issue.\n\nThe gameplay is like chess, if chess involved throwing your friend into the enemy because you're too lazy to cast a spell. Turn-based combat makes you feel like a tactical genius one minute and a tactical disaster the next when you realize you’ve accidentally set half your party on fire. It’s like managing a circus troupe where everyone’s carrying explosives, but somehow, it just works.\n\nThe characters? Oh boy. The writers must have taken every D&D trope, pumped them full of sass, emotional baggage, and questionable ethics, and let them loose. You’ve got Astarion, the vampire rogue who is somehow both ridiculously charming and the last guy you’d trust with your drink at a party. Gale, a walking magical catastrophe who really needs you to stop giving him magical items unless you want to explode. And then there’s Shadowheart—yeah, that’s her real name—who manages to be both an emo cleric and someone you’ll obsess over because... mystery! Oh, and let’s not forget the bear romance option. Yes, you read that right. Romance. Bear. Game of the Year.\n\nThe game has a knack for making you feel the consequences of your choices. Save a village, and they cheer your name. Accidentally (or intentionally, I don’t judge) blow up a chicken, and you'll hear about it for days. Every action has weight, whether you're deciding the fate of an entire kingdom or figuring out how not to accidentally trigger the “everyone dies” button on your new staff.\n\nBut the real beauty of Baldur’s Gate 3 is that it’s as chaotic as you make it. Want to be the noble hero, inspiring hope wherever you go? You can do that. Prefer to backstab everyone, steal their gold, and then watch the world burn? The game won’t stop you. Just, you know, maybe don’t forget that fire spreads really fast in this world.\n\nSo, should you play Baldur's Gate 3? Absolutely. But don't say I didn’t warn you: you're going to spend way too much time customizing your character’s hairstyle, getting emotionally attached to digital vampires, and debating whether romancing a shape-shifting bear is a step too far... or just far enough. Enjoy the chaos!",

Every inch of the world is full of secrets or charming details, the combat has near limitless possibilities and the characters really do feel alive. BG3 rewards those who commit, and it really is deserving of all the praise it gets given. As much as I love TES:IV or F:NV, I think BG3 easily is the best RPG of all time, though one I don't think I'll have the willpower to return to for years to come due to its length.",

        "review": "I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",

And I REALLY want to finnish this game and play it again! I love games but ive NEVER felt this way about a game before! And no other game has ever made me feel so manny different feelings. \r\n\r\nSo, to any gamer out there... It might be overwealming at first but PLEASE play Baldur's Gate 3.",

But let’s be real: it’s not the quests or the loot that have me hooked; it’s the irresistible charm of Astarion because who can resist a vampire with a flair for the dramatic?\n\nI went in for the epic battles and character growth, but I keep coming back for those witty vampire lines that make me question my life choices. Every time he flirts, I feel my heart (and my moral compass) slip further away. Who knew a bloodsucker could steal my heart (and maybe a few other things)?\n\nIf you’re looking for a game that combines adventure, heartbreak, and an overabundance of witty dialogue, look no further.  I might as well invest in some capes and embrace my new role as Astarion’s devoted admirer. Bring on the fourth run! 🦇❤️\n\n(Ok but the rest of the game is pretty good too though and i'm constantly seeing new scenes and dialogue i didn't see previously. ALL the characters are amazing and the amount of discoverability through new playthroughs has me in a chokehold).",

        "review": "It's a delight to play. It's what Skyrim was to RPG games in the 2010's, but instead in the 2020's. Plenty of game play. Balance is a little janky but it really would'nt be a D&D game without that. It does encourage meta gaming  but you can always play through multiple times instead of googling. Normally if someone says \"it has mods!\" like that feature automatically elevates the game, I roll my eyes. If a game needs mods to be awesome than it's not that awesome of a game. However this game was great before mods so adding mods to it is truly a delightful addition rather than crutch like so many other games. Like the previous entries in the Baldur's Gate Franchise this is highly recommended as it's a vast improvement on everything except the sound track (BG 1 still rules that department). My money is on this game pretty much being the RPG game of the decade for the 2020s.",

[b](Still is in some way)[/b]\n\nAs someone who was a complete noob to DnD i was a bit afraid of getting into this vast world, not knowing what i was going to find in every corner.  All i knew was that choices have consequences and they would haunt me forever [b][spoiler](Don't worry, i didn't hand over Scratch).[/spoiler][/b] \n\nI can safely say that when i was trapped in that wretched Nautiloid and infected with a mind controlling bug that would transform me into a humanoid squid, my paladin heart was ready for revenge and to curse whoever cursed me in the first place. \nIn an instant i was completely locked in and immersed after a few hours of gameplay and seeing how everything was so alive and connected, like the tiefling refugees begging for their lives, goblins screaming and the cute little squirrel that i accidentally kicked, we were off to a great start.[b](Oops)[/b] \n\nOne of the best parts about the game was the dialogue, every dialogue between the companions is extremely unique and you can't get all the dialogues options in a single playtrough since they depend on the companions fate, not to mention that even with NPC's/Enemys is fantastic, imagine convincing someone to kill themselves [b](NUTS, am i right?).[/b] \n\nThe best part was the companions, every one of them had a unique backstory that defined their personality. The blood sucker with his dark humor and vampire charm made him my favorite, i also had a soft spot for the god's favorite princess. \nThe game also lets you develop relationships with them and i was complete surprised by how much i cared about the approval/disapproval rating. When they created moments of tension as much as i wanted to wreak avoc i had to maintain the party cool, calm and collected because they were my babies. \n\nFor the combat i felt instantly overwhelmed with all the spell slots, actions, bonus actions, spells, ability checks and all that stuff, is safe to say that i was going bananas. After a few fights and trying to understand better the combat system i was amazed at all the possibilities that it had like manipulating the terrain, shoving enemies off a cliff, throwing enemys to each other with my fierce barbarian companion, it all felt like a puzzle and pretty satisfying when planning it all together. \n\nThis world is perfect for people who love to sniff every corner, turn every stone, solve every puzzle and even small decisions like helping out a random NPC is extremely rewarding. There's a lot of detail and a lot of effort put into everything. \n\nAll and all was one of the best gaming experiences that i had by far and it was worth every penny.",

The only part i don't like is that it can be a little bit confusing on where to go sometimes, but I really enjoy the fact that you can basically date and court all of the characters, haha. exceptional game with incredible graphics and very easily a strong time consumer!",

I have spent hundreds of hours laboriously going through every single location and noting every single item in the game. I've analyzed it through spreadsheets, I've played it with friends and colleagues. I know every inch of Baldur's Gate 3 even more than my playtime would indicate, and I had to do so as a job.\n\nAnd still, I find excuses to start a new play through, to see it all again. I still want to play more, to slow down and enjoy my time with the story and characters I love, in the system that I love. I play hundreds of games every year, and I report on even more than that. And yet, Baldur's Gate 3 -- possibly one of the most obvious choices possible -- might be my favorite game of all time, and certainly is my favorite game of the last few years. \n\nA true, absolute, medium-defining masterpiece, Baldur's Gate 3 is the pinnacle of gaming, period.",

        "review": "I bought Baldur's Gate 3, like many others, caught up in the wave of hype surrounding its release. At first, it didn't grab me. \nWith no prior experience playing Dungeons & Dragons and not being a fan of turn-based combat, I struggled to connect with the game. The mechanics felt foreign, and I found myself drifting away to play other titles.\n\nBut something about Baldur's Gate 3 kept pulling me back. I gave it another shot, and then, it clicked. \nI started to enjoy the combat, figuring out how to use the environment to my advantage, and I realized just how much influence you can wield outside of battle. Conversations, choices, and strategies became just as important as swinging a sword or casting a spell.\n\nI became invested in the characters, more than I have in any other game. Well, most of them — I don't like Wyll. His story just felt underwhelming compared to the others. Each companion had depth and complexity that kept me hooked. The freedom the game offers is truly unparalleled. I could shape my own story in ways that felt meaningful. I found myself losing track of time, wanting to know what would happen next.\n\nFast forward 150 hours(!), and I’ve just finished my first playthrough. Without a doubt, this is the best game I’ve ever played, and I’ve played a LOT of games. The sense of emptiness it leaves behind is almost painful. All I want to do is dive back in and start a new run. (Taking suggestions on what character or class to try next)\n\nIn summary, yes, I wholeheartedly recommend Baldur's Gate 3. It’s an unforgettable experience that sets a new standard for storytelling and player agency in games.\n\nPS: Be warned, though; after playing Baldur's Gate 3, other games may feel linear and their characters shallow in comparison.",

        "review": "Baldur's Gate 3 is a remarkable achievement in gaming, combining a good story with even greater characters, toghether with really fun gameplay with endless possibilities and you have a game you can replay hours. Want to kill an enemy the good old fashioned way? Pick up a sword and start swinging. Want to use a wide array of magics to strategically destroy your opponents? You got that too. Actually, how about just making people dance, laugh and sleep to death? Baldur's Gate 3 got you covered!\n\nCharacters; The characters are really interesting, from Lae'Zels obsession with Vlaakith and fulfilling the will of her people, to Astarion's story to break the cycle of abuse, Baldur's Gate 3 companions will for sure make a unique experiences. The reactivity these characters express is good, maybe a bit too good to the point i won't be able to look at Lydia from Skyrim the same way anymore. I also really liked how their stories are connected to the main plot which makes you want to finish the game even more and restart to see all the endless possibilities. One thing i disliked though is Wyll's character arc, which left me wanting for more, same thing with Karlach. Other then that though, the characters makes the journey to defeating the Absolute even more interesting everytime you boot up the game.\n\nGameplay; Gameplay-wise, it is super fun but confusing at first. I'l admit this is the first time i've played something similar to DnD, but man does it feel good to pick up the Paladin class and start using Divine Smite on every enemy till they die. I also love how Larian lets the players multiclass, letting us experiment the best builds or just trying out something stupid out for fun! It really lets the players imagination be the limit, which i really love. I've always loved using Wyll's Eldricht Blast to push enemies into a pit, but also using my Tav to become an Owlbear and kill a certain golem with a massive damaging leap. Only small nitpick i have is that combat is alright until you reach level 5, but other then that its a rampant climb up to becoming more and more...well, kinda broken. \n\nStory; The story for the most part, is pretty good! I really like the set-up done in Act 1, with lots to discover and learn while introducing stuff, but also the fact that it has content...like ALOT. Even after having 251 hours, i still find new stuff, and the fact that it takes me around 20 hours of really fun gameplay to reach Act 1 is a monument to how Larian wants to give out the best and fun content for their games. Same can be said about Act 2, with some turning-points in the story that makes you want to look at whats going to happen to characters you have been building a bond with. The set-up in Act 1 is used in a brilliant way. I know this is said about ALOT of games, but this game genuinely feels like the game...actually responds to your actions that you have taken in Act 1 aswell, which makes you want to see all the options this game has. I remember vividly playing with my friends and i remember a specific character being a little bit selfish, but once they didn't get what they wanted, they left the party and never came back. I made sure to give them what they wanted later, but the fact that our choice made an impact on the world and our companions made me realise; Wow, this game is REALLY as good as people say. The pacing for the most part is really solid aswell.\n\nNow, this might be a bit ironic, but the pacing really is solid...for the most part. Act 3 is really where everything goes haywire and ALOT of stuff happens. You can see how Larian were a bit stressed when it came to releasing the game, where you get 20+ quests as soon as you enter the big city. Usually, i become happy when i have alot of stuff to do but urgency overwhelmed me a little bit with the way the story was told, so it felt like a cat-and-mouse race to finish everything till the end credits. Urgency is for sure an important thing, especially in a big RPG like this and i like the way they presented it, but i was wishing for something more clear. It also felt a liiiiitle bit disjointed, especially some villains at the end but il be honest; One specific boss in a hopeful house really made me appreciate the way the game took its time with it and it made for a remarkable experience. Its one of the highlights for me when it comes to the game, especially after an ok last boss fight which had no business being really convoluting. I had to restart the last fight 3 times because the game didn't make it very clear where to go, which made me take a small break. Still, when the end credits arrived and i saw the conclusion to my story and my companions, i felt relived and very happy with how it ended. Definitely makes up for a memorable experience and a great conclusion to the Mind Flayer problem.\n\nI would also like to mention the Dark Urge storyline; If you have finished the game as a custom character, i advice you to PLEASE play as The Dark Urge, or Durge for short. Not only does it alter some scenes, it also gives a very story-rich experience with creepy tones of murder and death, gives you cool lore and items and with the cherry on top; An even more satisfying ending to your lunacy. What could be even cooler then saving the world? Saving the world while you have a voice in your head telling you NOT do that. Its definetly the best way to experience the game, good or evil, but its definetly a must.\n\nMusic; Lastly, i really want to mention the music. When the main menu slaps hard, you already know the game's OST is going to be even more heat. Granted i've been playing the game on and off but really focused this year; Its no wonder this game won Game of The Year. When you have a good story with great characters and fun gameplay that leaves you wanting for more, what could elevate it even more? A kickass soundtrack is the answer, and Baldur's Gate 3 delivers on that. The specific boss in the hopeful house has a theme that really kicks it up a notch, delivering a score you would believe came from Disney (Kinda ironic a satanic monster has a song that sounds like it came straight out of Cinderella, but whatever).\n\nComplaints and nitpicks; The performance for the most part is solid in Act 1 and 2, but i have to say; Act 3 really drops my frame-rate to 20-15 FPS which kinda sucks, so i hope Larian fixes it. I also would like to say that despite the amount of polishing and bugfixes there has been for this game, there are still alot of bugs and stuttering which i hope to be fixed if Larian plans on making a Patch 8. As said before, i also hope Wyll's character arc gets a conclusive ending, because for a character with the deepest connection with Baldur's Gate, it really does feel like a shallow pool of water once i've dipped into the late-game and there is not much to digest for Wyll. He's already pretty cool, but even better would be to add some stuff, be it more endings or some more scenes. I dont see Larian doing it, but its still something i hope for.\n\nAll in all, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game that truly deserves its awards and even more. I've been playing this game solo for around 120 hours now, but i wanna keep going by myself aswell and once and for all finish everything this game has to offer, especially the dreaded Honour mode that i am prepared for. If you're looking for a game to truly sink your teeth into that rewards creativity or problem-solving, this game is definetly for you. If you're looking for a game that respects the time you take to talk to every NPC and achieve something, good or bad, this game is for you. If you want a game that challnges your morality and the fate you will take your characters, this game is for you.\n\nOr, if you wanna just talk to some funny fish people and they help you when it comes to the game's most important bossfight, yeah just put the game in your cart already.\n\nTLDR; Praise Kuo-Toa!",

        "review": "\r\nBaldur's Gate 3: A Masterpiece in Modern RPGs\r\n\r\nBaldur's Gate 3 is a near-perfect game, blending an intricately woven narrative, vast freedom of choice, and a deep, tactical combat system to create one of the most immersive role-playing experiences ever made. Developed by Larian Studios, this game has captured the hearts of RPG fans and newcomers alike. Here's why it is loved by so many and is often considered one of the best games of its genre.\r\n\r\n1. Rich Storytelling and Worldbuilding\r\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Baldur's Gate 3 is its story. Set in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, the game immediately draws you into a richly crafted world filled with vibrant characters, complex factions, and moral dilemmas. Every decision you make feels consequential, and your choices significantly alter the game's outcome—whether it’s during dialogue, combat, or exploration. This branching narrative system is what makes the game so unique. Players feel they are shaping the world around them, which provides an unparalleled level of immersion.\r\n\r\nThe game’s setting, Faerûn, is brought to life with exquisite detail. From dark, mysterious caverns to bustling cities, each location is visually stunning and narratively rich. The game respects D&D lore while making it accessible for those unfamiliar with the tabletop version.\r\n\r\n2. Tactical, Deep Combat System\r\nLarian Studios took the turn-based combat mechanics of Divinity: Original Sin and refined them for Baldur’s Gate 3. The combat system stays true to D&D’s 5th Edition rules, but with an intuitive interface and fluid design that makes it easy to understand for new players while still offering depth for veterans. You’re not just fighting enemies—you’re using the environment, coordinating your party’s abilities, and thinking tactically to win encounters.\r\n\r\nEvery class and character offers a distinct playstyle, making combat feel fresh each time. Whether you're using a wizard's fireball to rain destruction on enemies or a rogue’s sneak attack to surprise foes from the shadows, combat always feels rewarding. The variety in abilities, spells, and tactics gives you countless ways to approach each battle.\r\n\r\n3. Freedom of Choice and Role-Playing\r\nPerhaps the most beloved feature of Baldur's Gate 3 is its emphasis on player agency. This is a game where you can truly role-play in any way you desire. Want to play a noble hero saving the realm? Or maybe a cunning trickster who manipulates every situation for personal gain? Every dialogue option, quest, and even combat interaction is designed with flexibility in mind.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue system, in particular, stands out. Voice acting is stellar, and the branching conversations allow for wildly different outcomes based on your choices. You can persuade, deceive, or intimidate characters to sway situations in your favor. This freedom makes each playthrough feel distinct and personal, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in their character's story.\r\n\r\n4. Memorable Characters and Companions\r\nA hallmark of any great RPG is its cast of characters, and Baldur’s Gate 3 excels in this area. The companions you meet along your journey are not just sidekicks; they are fully realized individuals with their own motivations, personalities, and moral alignments. Their backstories are engaging, their interactions with the player are emotionally charged, and their personal quests are some of the most compelling parts of the game.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic between party members can lead to disagreements, relationships, or even betrayal depending on your choices. This level of complexity brings a level of depth rarely seen in games, and players can’t help but grow attached to their companions.\r\n\r\n5. High Replayability\r\nBecause of the game’s complex choice system, no two playthroughs are the same. Whether it's the different classes, races, or moral decisions you make, Baldur's Gate 3 constantly offers new experiences with each run. The sheer variety of approaches—whether you focus on diplomacy, brute force, or stealth—ensures that the game remains fresh even after dozens of hours of play. The multiple endings, hidden secrets, and alternative paths keep players coming back for more.\r\n\r\n6. Stunning Visuals and Sound Design\r\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is not just mechanically sound—it’s a feast for the senses. The graphics are breathtaking, from the spell effects in combat to the intricate designs of cities and dungeons. The attention to detail in character models and environments makes the world feel alive. Coupled with a rich soundtrack that perfectly complements the game’s tone—whether you’re in a peaceful village or a tense combat encounter—the audiovisual presentation is outstanding.\r\n\r\n7. Cooperative Multiplayer\r\nOn top of everything, Baldur's Gate 3 offers a cooperative multiplayer mode that allows friends to experience the story together. It’s rare to find an RPG that supports multiplayer so seamlessly. Whether you want to plan out your tactical combat strategies or role-play different characters during the same campaign, the multiplayer experience adds another layer of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nBaldur's Gate 3 is a near-perfect game because it encapsulates everything fans love about role-playing games: a deep, engaging narrative, rich character development, strategic combat, and endless player agency. It strikes the perfect balance between honoring its D&D roots and innovating in ways that make it accessible to a broader audience. The game’s replayability, immersive world, and emotional depth create an experience that is nothing short of masterful.\r\n\r\nFor fans of the genre, or even those curious about role-playing games, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a must-play. It has set a new standard in RPGs, proving that thoughtful storytelling and complex gameplay systems can come together to form a game loved by millions.",

This game convinced me I need to play more games. It is so good. I mean, this is an all timer. Kind of game that kind of makes you sad that it's this good, because you know most games will never reach this level of well done. Characters are fun and endearing, appealing to classic tropes while also turning them on their head. The story allows you to really kind of go how you please. I never felt I had to play one specific way, and in fact, the game often rewards you for getting weird with your solutions. This game has literally been devouring hours of my life since I bought it, and it will continue to do so.",

        "review": "Divinity Original Sin 2 is my favorite game and I've never played a TTRPG. BG3 is a very satisfying experience for DOS 2 fans and the story and ambitious scope of the game are truly remarkable. But I can't help feeling that the TTRPG elements that make it more authentic get tiring quickly. There are many trap heavy segments that are very repetitive, many ambushes and many dice roll checks, all of which slow down gameplay. That said I really like that missions can be tackled in many different ways including speech checks and that exploration can give you more dialogue options and even adavantages in combat.\nThe combat encounters are varied but are usually on the easier side even on tactician, unfortunately some of them are just plain annoying and not really challenging. The tougher battles are focused on trying to prevent weak allied NPCs from dying, it's not a big detractor but it does happen often.\n\nThe structure of the 3 acts is overall really good. The detour to the githyanki creche felt out of place and could maybe have been shortened and added to act1. You can skip it but there are good rewards if you do it. I really liked act2 except that the final boss is way too overtuned. Passing a speech check makes the fight harder, the boss has a ton of HP, does a ton of damage, prevents your party from healing and can get massive heals regularly. The highlight of act3 is the the city that is much more fleshed out than what you got in DOS2, and seeing your party get really strong is always fun.\n\nIn comparison to DOS2 there is less strategy during combat and less variety in builds so I didn't get that feeling of having fun spell synergies. On the plus side the combat arena is much less likely to become a fiery wasteland of oozing and exploding liquids. Equipment and bartering was a big part of DOS2 and I enjoyed visiting traders every so often to see if there were any interesting new items that fit my builds, traders in BG3 offer a lot less variety and you're likely to end the game with a lot of unspent gold. It's still a good idea to look for new traders because they usually have a couple items worth getting but you probably don't need to see them again after that. One big upgrade to the DOS2 system is the ability to jump and not having to rely in a spell like teleportation, even if baby legs Astarion can't reach certain places without some equipment bonuses XD.\nLarian has again done a great job with the stories and companions but it does feel like you have your 3 main companions and the rest will be under utilized. I did play with most companions at least a little bit and got to experience their stories even if I was not as invested in them as I was in my main 3.\n",

        "review": "I wish there was something in between a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down for this one. \n\nAs someone completely unfamiliar with D&D and minimal experience with RPGs, the learning curve was BRUTAL. Time spent researching game mechanics and combat tips online took away from the (now much smaller) time bucket to actually play the game, which completely detracts from the experience. As a solo player there was just too much to learn and the constant reload of fights was tiring. By Act III I was dreading playing, which sucks, because I know this is a good game.\n\nI'm mixed on this one since I have to assume anyone who has experience with these types of games flat out loved it. Ending with a recommendation with the caveat that if you are new to this type of game, don't expect to muscle your way through. \n\nBack to first/third-person shooters.",

It’s absolutely phenomenal, the scope of this game is crazy and the freedom is so refreshing! Admittedly, I wasn’t initially impressed or drawn in and only gave this game a chance because I knew it was different but no matter how I felt after each session I sat down and played the game I was always pulled back in for a reason I couldn’t tell you. After spending quite some time in Act 1 something just clicked, suddenly I got this game, understood what it was doing and started to really appreciate every action I took and every area I explored. Every time I boot up this game I enjoy it more and more and it still surprises me with how great it is, I see why it won game of the year and really appreciate the effort Larian Studios put in to this game. As I said at the start I am still yet to finish this game but I am drawing to a close, however this will not be the end of the game for me! There’s still so much I want to do so many choices I want to pick and I can tell I have a game that will entertain me for hundreds of hours more! I urge everyone who hasn’t enjoyed this game to give it another shot and keep pushing on as I did, it constantly improves and there’s always joy to be found in the wonderful world of Faerûn!\n",

I'd never played D&D, I'd never even heard of Larian, and when my friends tell me to buy a game I actively avoid it because I don't like being told what to do.

There are that many different ways to play the game--which is fitting, since this is the closest thing you're going to get to playing a tabletop roleplaying game without actually playing one.\r\n\r\nJust like the original Baldur's Gate, this game will still be talked about and played 20 years after its release.",

Baldurs Gate 3 is the only game where I've gotten to the end and wanted to immediately start a new play-through, most of the time I get tired of games after playing them for too long, by the end of games like Red dead redemption 2 or God of war 2018 and Ragnarok i'll just be tired of them (Don't get me wrong I love those games)Baldurs Gate 3 is not one of those games. Before I got Baldurs Gate I was trying to convince myself not to get it because I thought it was too expensive. When the game finally went on sale I decided to get it and I don't regret at all, the characters are interesting and likable with fleshed out stories and arcs, the combat is incredible in my eyes, there are many abilities and most of them are useful. My biggest issue was that some of the late game fights are kind of unfair (for the sake of being spoiler free I wont go into detail about the fights. One of my favorite things about the game is probably the ability to craft your own character and role-play as them. The game gives you an incredible amount of freedom of choice, you have control to play the character you want to play, you can be a hero, villain or somewhere in between (and there is ALOT in between trust me). As you can probably tell I'm not the best at writing reviews but I felt like I needed to give my opinion on this game because it deserved another good review, it really is an incredible game.",

I have felt real emotions (fear, love, deep regret) in some of the games listed above, but not here.\n\nThere are a few logical bugs that appear if the player does somethings in a different sequence to what the game designer expected.  Not a major problem, but again a bit of a negative.\n\nSome of the boss battles can be difficult without Googling the best way to deal with them, and some of those ways are far from obvious from the game itself.  In any event I decided to gain more experience to get more abilities and more spells and the like before going back to the boss battles.  But that was no use, the game does not allow progression beyond level 12, so there was I doing all these side quests for nothing.\n\nNevertheless, the game was a useful distraction for me until something better came along, until…\n… a recent down load (October 2024) killed the game.  If I now try to run the game (on my Mac) it crashes and I get an error message, but it does not allow me to type anything in the description box, so goodness knows what use the error reports are to whoever receives them.\n",

Oh and a large part of the gameplay is exploring and talking to people, which Larian have done quite well.\n\nApropos exploring and talking... The world you'll find yourself exploring is very detailed and always a pleasure to look upon. The only reason you might not find hyper detailed props and textures everywhere you look, is that otherwise your graphics card might commit sepukku. The characters and people you meet throughout your adventure are all brought to life by very good character designs and phenomenal voice actors.\n\nNow to the story, its good, really good. Is it a magnum opus of a story? Nyeh... no not really, is it still good? Absolutely. \nWhat they've done quite good as well are the companions you're travelling with. Even though you won't get to shank all of them in one playthrough, the core companions all have their own storylines which you can follow. These are - like most of this game - very well made, though some of them have greater impact on the main story than others.\nEven though I've just finished my first playthrough, I'll replay it, because there are just so many possible approaches to encounters, choices, and that isn't even including the character creator.\n\nYeah, the character creator. It's complex and gives you a lot of choices as to who you are, what class you play, what your origin is, what spells or sub-classes you use - And then you haven't even changed to look of your character!\n\nSooo... yeah, play it.\nYou'll have fun.",

Playing as a Drow gives you limitless racist comments and if you want to feel better than anybody - be a sorcerer. Bard either sweet talks everybody or you'll most likely be amused throughout... oh, and Astarion must be a monk - open hand is OP. Also, if you mess up in any other romance or wanna experience everything? SAY YES TO MIZORA. Okay, I'm done. Wait, if you kill the NightSong you stopped the cutest couple from their happy-ever-after and I hope your heart hurts. Play this goddamn game and you'll feel like you missed out on a thousand things - but, it'll still make you incredibly happy :))))",

I do have a few gripes with the game: 1) I wanted to be a Undead Necromancer, which is what I usually play in these rpgs. I get that it wont work with the story, but Larian's previous game Divinity 2 allowed that. (But I get it wouldn't make sense in this story so I can forgive them and hope modders can create something along this line). 2) I didn't like how every character, early in the game, just wants to jump on you \"D\", (I'm looking at you Gale!!!) and it's like NO, I just want to help my companions, and not every story needs to lead to sex. I would've liked more options to have a great story and not ruin companion relations just cuz I don't wanna have sex with them. Karlach is someone I love, but won't romance with cuz she's too cool. \r\n\r\nI hope the next DnD style game will be more flexible with character creations and hopefully all classes can be   a little more fun",

I put hours and hours into the prerelease game, and then when it was full released, I bolted through the first act, the second act wasn't appealing, so I bolted through that too. I got to the third act thinking there would be MUCH more content, because it had to be right? Surely after everyone experienced the full content of act 1 in early games, and having to drag your feet through the second act in turn based actions, surely there would be much more content! To me it felt like there'd be a 4th act, then suddenly there's this quick pivot and you're at the end of the game. It was a terrible feeling. After so much hype and hope building up, the only thought I had at the end of the game was 'really? This is it? I spent so much time playing in beta as a guinea pig, constantly having to remake a character, and this is all that I had to look forward too?!'\n\nI recommend the game to people of course, but i also tell them to take their time in ACT 1, because the game is extremely short after it.\nI personally feel extremely disappointed. My experience completely killed all will to replay over and over again, I wish I never played the beta",

The story seems decent, but I've only experienced up to the end of Act 1.  And here lies the problem: I absolutely HATE the combat.  \n\nCombat encounters take forever, and I always feel outnumbered and under-powered.  I've tried about a dozen different builds, a multitude of strategies, but nothing feels powerful.  Things feel a tiny bit better after you get to level 5, but it's a slog up to that point.  The game AI is very unfair.  Enemy will always outnumber you, will have access to more and better spells, and rarely misses.  And there is no excuse for the idiotic camera control in a game with this price tag. \n\nIn a word, frustrating.  If you're not experienced in D&D rules, you should probably skip this one.",

This is a fully, loaded, complete game, that has more content then you will more than likely be able to complete, not to mention the modding capabilities that have so much potential. Definitely worth every cent and I've only spent like 6 hours on the game. I've spent 6k plus on Ark and can't even give that a thumbs up.... but that has more to do with Snail Games company than Ark itself.",

With the added mod manager this game allows for even more creativity and freedom, which was already an extraordinary amount. Excellent replay value! I have over 200 hours as of writing this review and I still find new things constantly. If you do not care for playing through a story line or don't care for roleplay, I can imagine this game could be a bit lacking. But it still offers a fun challenge for people who like complicated and strategic combat, and exploration. DnD mechanics are integrated into the game very well, in my not so expert opinion, and it helped me understand the mechanic of DnD better. \n\nAnd also, because of course we cannot ignore it, the romance is a lot of fun. I also believe, contrary to what other seem to complain about, that the romance is not forced onto you or obnoxious. Once you reject a character they won't pursue you and you still get to have their emotional story through a platonic POV. \n\nAll in all, recommend this game a 100% and I want to thank Larian for bringing out my obsession of the past months!",

I think this is a great game for someone who might have a hard time getting into it since you need other people and the whole set up irl (me). I already enjoy story with combat games and character customization. The choices you can make are really diverse and there is sooooo much to explore and discover. You could really immerse yourself in the world and honestly, its a pretty relaxing game for me! (I can also eat while I play lol) I went and still am going into it blind, no wiki etc. I think getting lost and just stumbling across things and learning the mechanics as you go is an experience in itself.",

The game gets you for a long time. Going through Act 2 ending, i already have ideas for the next walkthrough, which i'm sure i will start right after final credits. The world and the story is in every object and sound. It's all about the nature, the architecture, the environment, that i can't help myself but taking a closer look at. Not just main characters have astonishing level of details about their appearance, behavior and stories, NPSs also do. You gain bonds with every character, each in a different way.\n\nThe best part for me is, there is no way to play the game wrong. Your decisions, or not making them at all, can be represented in a different combinations of verbal interactions and doings. There is literally a numerous ways to put your own idea in all of the happening events. \n\nThe game is a great deal of work, looking forward to the next Larian's project in the future. Big thanks to the developing team <3",

Spoilers below.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful graphics that are seamless between gameplay and cutscenes.\n- My first introduction to DnD and its is really well presented and fun to play. love the dice rolls, lots of ways to play.\n- Meaningfull dialogue choices and an intriguing plot\n- well fleshed out characters and world.\n- Great turn based combat.\n- A slow but good start with Act 1\n- Act 2 is the game at its height, would of been 10/10 if we stopped here and got rid of some BG city references obviously.\n- Thorm is a pretty good villain. \n\n\nThe negatives are long and more detailed to showcase why such a great game fell a point and a bit for me.\nNegatives:\n- The game generally falls apart around act 3 in terms of bugs and writing quality. Characters would constantly forget what i did (like wyll begging me to save his father from the prison even tho he is in camp with us and they talked, the printing press pixie knowing then not knowing who i am etc).\n- Characters constantly stop following you if you jump somewhere, even if they can follow.\n- The city is underwhelming despite being overwhelming with nothing npcs.\n- The gather your allies quest mattered a lot less than i thought. All of your hard work is tied down to a friendly npc to help fight in the final area, they get no or minimal send offs after the fight which is laughable in a game like this, if you aren't part of the main crew, you dont affect the ending. Not even a bare minimum slideshow like Fallout NV. (this brings it from 9/10 to 8.75, very empty feeling ending).\n- Orsin may just be the lamest thing ever along with her self cloak every turn, unstoppable, minions. They are some of the most annoying enemies in gaming. Nothing worse than knowing orsin is copying someone only to have you character look like a fool and gasp for the 5th time. One note evil characters can be good, but not like this in this late of a role. Couldnt tell you much about gortash, bro sits in his office and they should of showed more of what his evil rule is like as the act continues.\n- The final fight is enemy spam which only made gales bomb seem like a better option every turn.\n- My ending just stopped when karlach went to avernus with wyl, music played as we were forced to stare at her up close for 7 minutes before i had to reboot the game to pre boss fight... so gale option it was.",
