My favorite combat of any game, and it's for a genre I usually hate. So much synergy, so much adaptability, what a triumph of game design.\nThe only game where I don't make a custom character and actually go for a pre-made one. Just exceptional all around.",

Every encounter starts with getting set on fire and having to wait for an eternity for your turn. \n\nFort Joy is excellent. I've played it three times, but Reaper Coast encounters are too frustrating. I could endure and push through, reloading an encounter until I knew how it would play out. I would still recommend it, but it is not for me. I preferred Pillars of Eternity or Pathfinder WOTR combat and the rule-set, and BG3 was the perfect mix of those mechanics but easier to understand for newer players.",

I didn't have issues with DOS 1, where I was able to play a less than optimal party and still had fun with it. \r\nEverything I do is a mistake (sounds a lot like life, eh?). So many persuasion checks failed. Cannot open a single chest. Watched guides to give myself and idea, but still felt underpowered throughout the whole game, except in one or two places where I clearly fought way later than I should have had. \r\nTurned to the wiki for help with quests. Act 2, had a lot of quests unfinished and didn't know where to go. Some of the solutions were outside of my skill level (ie, bring this item here, cast this spell, and so on). \r\nI got one shotted so many times. My last fight was against aetera, she summons 2 wolves which kill one of my characters before they can act. A single spell of her removes all of my magic resistance, while I have to use several characters turns to remove hers, and something similar happened in pretty much every fight. \r\nI'm aware there are cheese strategies, I don't want to use them, and this includes using barrels, teleporting away, buffing in dialogue. \r\nSo, this doesn't feel like I'm playing a game. I'm half-assing a guide, and stumbling step by step, reading a wiki then trying a bit of my own, making the wrong choice, and going back to the wiki. And reloading a lot. I think there were only 2 fights in the entire playthrough were I didn't need to reload. \r\nSo yeah, I didn't understood this game. I have a feeling that trying to play a necro was the wrong choice for a starter character. Oh well, rant over, I'm just venting out of frustration. I wanted to like this game so much.",

This game is immensely fun solo or with friends and multiple ways to do quests in the game, making it a very fun experience even on a replay. \n\nThough what makes this game stands out, is the spectacular voice acting and combat mechanics which gets you thinking how to maximize your turn, and trying out different strategies that just somehow works. Though there are certain character builds that outclass others and are easier to play while dishing out insane dps (I'm looking at you, ranger). \n\nOverall, a 9/10 game with my only problem is that not all of the companions in this game are written as equally well as others. I won't elaborate much due to spoilers, but I wish the next instalment to this series balances the companion writing.",

I trudged through this game with them mostly because of the sunk cost and multiplayer with the friend is fun even if I don't like the game. \r\n\r\nI have several issues with balancing, the story, and gameplay mechanics. But a lot of those someone could argue come to taste. I personally think armor as a way to block statuses is a bandaid solution, but someone else might think that is interesting. Another example is I think the randomness is too high, but some people like rolling dice. So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt sometimes. However the UI issues I have are actually inexcusable.\r\n\r\nWhen I use borderless windowed, sometimes I would click on a menu and it sends my characters off into the wilderness. Chaining and unchaining characters is finicky. Targeting is glitchy at times. The number of times enemies shot me through walls or I was blocked by an invisible something is too high. Bartering is a chore when money gets high. AI pathing leaves a lot to be desired.  \r\n\r\nOn the Balance side, I hated how much each fight depended on levels. If we weren't within 1 maybe 2 levels of the fight we would get one shot by some high initiative enemy. However, if we were at the level of the enemy, they would get vaporized. This essentially makes a somewhat open game, more or less linear, but based on the level of the enemies. The endgame was also pretty free as long as they didn't have some BS mechanic. Overall, the strategy never felt satisfying. \r\n\r\nI doubt I'll try another game by the devs. It just seems half baked. I honestly don't understand how people like this other than them being so starved for D&D campaigns that they don't know better.",

        "review": "I played through DOS2 a couple times when the Definitive Edition came out years ago and hadn't replayed it since. I finished up a playthrough recently after numerous replays of Baldur's Gate 3 and here is how it holds or doesn't hold up. Again, this review is a hybrid between, well, a review and a comparison between the two games since I am assuming people buying DOS2 now, are doing so after they played BG3 and want more Larian content, so spare me the salt if you are a DOS2 fanboy:\n\n• The writing and the story are pretty hit or miss while the companions don't even compare to those of BG3:\n-- The main story is kind of a goofy person's idea and attempt at creating a convoluted story and multiple plot points, legit \"random bullsh*t go\" moments around every corner, but ultimately it is engaging enough to see it through to completion. Side quests can be very entertaining so don't skip those.\n-- The writing is classic Larian, with a lot of NPCs being very snarky and frankly dislikeable, with the occasional goofy but charming character thrown into the mix - reminds me a lot of Divinity II: Ego Draconis in that regard. It is a style that you have to learn to like.\n-- The companions as I said don't even hold a candle to even the weakest BG3 companions - they are pretty unlikable and remain such throughout, very one-note characters that might just make you feel bad for neglecting Wyll in every playthrough.\n\n• The soundtrack is nice if very repetitive, I can only listen to so many variations of the main theme before I have to lower the game's Music volume slider - it is an issue with BG3 as well to some extent, all stemming from the composer Boris Slavov being a rather uninspired fellow. He had big shoes to fill and a big bar to clear by succeeding Kirill Pokrovsky and frankly, I feel like he didn't even try with this game. It doesn't help that his style is more Hollywood vs. Kirill's more classical approach to music.\n\n• The level design is one of the two aspects of this game that take first place compared to BG3. Maps are vast and can be pretty vertical, full of challenging terrain and secrets to find - BG3's is way more condensed which ultimately doesn't allow you to play much with the limited utility skills it offers (Teleport, Fly etc.).\n\n• Speaking of utility skills, the other aspect DOS2 takes the cake on is build/ spell/ skill variety. All the available skills and spells, the fact that you can combine spells from different types together and the fantastic variety of utility spells that can interact with the world in so many ways, BG3 unfortunately just cannot compete, it gets totally outclassed.\n\n• The balancing/ difficulty is easily the lowest point of DOS2. Even on Classic, encounters are ridiculously overtuned:\n-- Initiative is a losing battle, significant enemies will always go first unless you pump Initiative like crazy, which would in turn leave you weak in every other way and still wouldn't give you the edge over many late-game bosses,\n-- A very awkward Armor/ Magic Armor system that essentially adds two additional healthbars to all enemies - you have to deplete them before you are able to actually deal damage,\n-- This goes hand in hand with the above but enemies and especially bosses can be ridiculously overtuned - 4+ actions per turn, thousands of HP and thousands of Armor and Magic Armor healthbars, Auras that give them a boost to stats while reducing yours,\n-- Not a single battle goes by without the enemy applying \"Decay\" on you with seemingly any move - that status effect turns healing into a damaging effect on anyone that has it,\n-- Speaking of cheese, all enemies are omnipotent. They are coded to have a level 3 of Loremaster at bare minimum so they always instantly know everything there is to know about your characters, such as their resistances/ weakness, whether they are Undead or not or if they have certain talents like Glass Cannon.\n\nAll the AI cheating starts to wear down the experience after a while, so much so that you are heavily encouraged to go for cheesy tactics like unchaining party members to sneak around after a fight has started for optimal positioning and to get in free shots, barrelmancy, terrain transmutation (lava, your best friend in Act 2) and other such stuff. The good ol' Larian encounter design philosophy of blast them before they can even move or get fucked. BG3's encounter design is far superior. While it is easier, it feels far more engaging and actually entertaining.\n\nAll in all, BG3 is the better game. If you go into DOS2 expecting more BG3, first of all check your expectations cause you'll be disappointed and second, I suggest you don't play on Classic and especially not on Tactician, unless of course you are fine with cheesing encounters, as everyone does with this game.\n\nStill, it is worth buying and playing through in full and despite how harsh my criticism of it might seem, I'd still give it a solid 4/5.",

The fact that you can FREELY interact with almost everything in this game is just insane, there are so many ways to go about completing the story, so many origin characters to learn about (Fane number 1), you WILL be addicted to this game.

        "review": "An incredibly good game with some astounding features that will knock you off your feet. Sometimes literally. I absolutely love what Larian did with this game and that it directly led to the blockbuster success of Balders Gate. When I first played I wanted it to be more like D&D but it has it's own system and it is actually very interesting and fun. \n\nGot a water surface? Why not cast a lightning spell and shock everyone standing on it? Or perhaps you want to throw a fireball and turn that water into vapor and block vision in the area. Or combine the two, turn the water into vapor then shock the vapor and you get an electric cloud. Its freaking ingenious. \n\nMany of the spells and abilities have hidden effects, for instance if you turn someone to stone then smash  them with something heavy you will shatter them. Poison the undead and it will heal them. I thought that aspect was very cool, using poison like you use potions in most games. There are so many combinations between abilities it blows my mind that the developers made all of this function so seamlessly.\n\nThe quests and combat are excellent and the overall story is very, very cool. I wish I could tell the full story of the race me and a friend had to reach something partway through the game and how invested we both were in that reward. It was the most dramatic finish of all time, and I got swept away. We both were surprised by the outcome of that quest and that made the experience even more memorable. It is one of the best couch COOP games you can play on a console. \n\nIf I have any gripes its that the sections of the game are compartmentalized into chapters. In repeat playthroughs, as fun as they were, involved doing the same things you did last time maybe in a few different ways but ultimately leading to the same outcome. \n\nOverall, this is a masterpiece second only to Balders Gate, which I strongly encourage Larian to not abandon, they built a true winner and a platform that could keep gamers entertained for generations to come.",

        "review": "I've started this game 5+ times and never got out of the first act.  It's a slow start. The combat also has it's own, unique flavor: focus on magic vs. physical armor, reduce armor, then rely on damage type/combination (oil/fire/ice/etc) and cc. It's pretty different from DND combat (like BG3).  I don't know, something just kept discouraging me from continuing.\r\n\r\nBut I gave it one more shot and I'm glad I did because I beat it!  It ended up being an overall enjoyable, classic rpg experience,  The combat is very challenging, and each fight does have it's own interesting mechanic.  The characters' personalities are pretty one dimensional and cliche, but I was still surprised a few times in the story.  Everyone has both good/evil qualities, so it makes for a gritty, realistic feel.  You do pick classes for your characters, but everyone kind of has the option to be good at anything.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for something similar to BG3, it's close, but pretty different. The combat in DOS2 will feel familiar (and tbh the storylines will ALSO feel pretty dang similar) but don't expect to get attached to any of the characters the same way.\r\n\r\nMy final playthrough took 110hrs (my total gametime on Steam is 197hrs, so that's ~90hrs of redoing that first act and stopping)",

        "review": "Divinity: Original Sin. \n\nFor background, I played this and the first one with members of my family, in multiplayer, in a weekly session of approximately three to four hours. It took 15 months to finish this game, 171 hours total. and I don't regret that time.  It is certainly superior to its predecessor, though I do not think that it is so improved you couldn't stand to play Divinity: Original Sin 1 afterwards. \n\nThe addition of height and the tactical effects that allows for, as well as Blessed and Cursed variants of terrain, are the largest mechanical additions, and they do a lot. Some skills do not return from 1, and some are added, generally for the better. Mechanically, 2 is superior and siginificantly more pleasant to play. The area and town designs are superior, the side quests are generally of higher quality, and there are meaningful choices to be made - though many do not echo very far into the future. \n\nHowever, my review is here to make sure you know what you're getting into for multiplayer. Singleplayer? Like CRPGS? No problems here for you really, go play! But you can read on if you want to hear about the combat balance, story,  etc.\n\nMultiplayer design has arguably taken a step back. The fact is that regularly telling a multiplayer group \"Hey, we're going to force you to oppose eachother in various ways throughout the whole game\" is... terrible. The game actually dealt social strife to my family because of how long term our investment was. I'm genuinely shocked how the ending resolves in multiplayer - Some of us didn't even get cutscenes for some major story moments at the end! \n\nWe broke quests by talking to NPCs with the wrong characters, among a host of other minor multiplayer bugs or issues.  We got outcomes nobody wanted, sometimes due party dialogue functioning as a voting system, when we'd really rather tiebreak ourselves than because X was closest at the time and it was an even vote. \n\nBalancing was absolutely out of whack - we played on the middle difficulty (normal, I guess?) and it seems that even the definitive edition didn't tighten things up. Glass Cannon, Executioner, Skin Graft, and Apotheosis should probably all not be in this game, and in multiplayer made the game actively unfun (because whoever doesn't have those is just going to be less important, less effective, and less of a participant in combat, which is near if not more than half your playtime in the game. By the time you realize you need a harder difficulty to make that okay, it's not an option. Going up in difficulty REQUIRES restarting the game - which we simply weren't going to do, 100 hours and 7+ months in.) \n\nThe designers made fun systems, but the lack of attention paid to the dynamic of multiple people interacting with all the thing they've made - story, combat, levels, gear, dialogue.... it's disappointing.\n\nFinally, the story. I'll try to be vague but there are broad (but not specific) spoilers and criticism of the story's structure. \n\nThe story of 2 is merely serviceable. The story of 1 was cheesy and cliche yes, but Divinity 2 is nearly well-written. It unfortunately fumbles at several key steps - \n\nOne prewritten character/Companion should really be a forced party member given how they interact with the main plot directly continuously and are an important narrative thread to tie everything together.  \n\nThe villains have their ups and downs, but mostly ups, and at the end are poorly fitted to the narrative in their reasoning if not motivations.  We simply hadn't been given good reason to trust them, and while I can't say for sure given our ending if we should or should not have trusted them... it certainly feels like the \"Good\" ending is one we didn't get, and the one being hinted at at the end feels like an unreliable narrator's push to get you to do it, even though now that we're done our epilogues certainly suggest it could've been the real good ending.\n\nFinally for story, a major supporting character is introduced as shady, assholish, and mysterious, and that lasts too long. By the time the game firmly establishes they're on your side, you've grown to dislike them. Just before then, out of the blue they try to open up to you and give you their backstory and an explanation of their mystery... but we weren't having any of that. By then, they'd missed other opportunities in the story to reveal these things, and it was just too late. Then the game goes and confirms them anyways - like what?\n\n Most criticism of the story here is at the root \"this scene/dialogue is in the wrong place if you know what the full story is going to be\" though there's only a few of these. They are all pretty big though, and so it takes a good (but not great) story down to just serviceable - even if from minute to minute, almost all the minutes are \"good\" and some are \"great\".\n\nStill, there's not much out there for CRPG fans, and it's certainly a good game. I'd probably try and play it a much quicker pace than 15 months if I were you - it certainly didn't do the game any favors!",

        "review": "Divinity Original Sin 2 excels with its engaging story-line, filled with twists that keep you hooked, and its strategic turn-based combat that encourages creative thinking. The deep customization options allow for unique characters and playthroughs, enhancing replay-ability. Visually, the game is stunning, with beautifully crafted environments and detailed character models, all complemented by a fitting soundtrack. The multiplayer mode adds another layer of fun, especially with the Game Master mode for custom campaigns.\n\nHowever, the game does have a steep learning curve, which can be challenging for newcomers. Some players might find the turn-based combat slow-paced, particularly during longer battles. Inventory management can become cumbersome due to the large number of items and equipment. Additionally, the game has its share of bugs and glitches, though these are often patched by the developers. Lastly, while the voice acting is generally good, some performances can be hit or miss.\n\nOverall, the game offers a deeply rewarding experience for those who enjoy rich storytelling and strategic game play, despite a few minor drawbacks.",

Chief complaints would be that the user interface *desperately* needs an undo since sometimes you click to attack but it instead moves you to that point wasting your action and probably getting you out of position.  An undo would fix this but they couldn't be bothered.  Some of the quests are deeply unbalanced, for example whoever came up with the demon possessing one party member after another should be keel hauled.  The devs spent (wasted?) gobs of time on a system of combining things which is kinda cool if you're into that (I'm not).  Coop is decent (mostly), though there is a highlander air of there can be only one that is against the coop grain.  Overall this game shows that even on a good day computer gaming is a distant second to table top.  The game is like table top with a very poor DM plus poor mechanics.",

        "review": "This game is amazing. If you are looking for something similar to Baldur's Gate 3, this is it. They use the same system, but the story and characters are different. The biggest differences are that this game forces you to take an origin character so there is no option to create your own, and there are no dice rolls but instead skill checks rely on ability points that you assign upon leveling up. Everything else is basically identical.\r\n\r\nI think it is notably more difficult than BG3. I chose to play on \"classical\" difficulty, which I assume was normal as it was neither as epic or chill sounding as the other options, but quickly found out that this game really expects you to explore as much as possible and find and do all of the quests and adventures it sets out for you. If you don't, you will be severely under leveled and certain fights will be impossible. I think BG3 was a lot more lenient here. Or maybe I'm just bad. I also think that a lot of the quests are not very intuitive. I recall there was one instance where I was stuck because I never noticed there was a very small key on the floor, covered by debris, that was necessary to take to further the game. You will have to look online at some points, since completing quests for experience is so crucial. Maybe accessibility is the reason why BG3 became so popular while this never did.\r\n\r\nHowever I really like the writing in this game. From the dialogue to the quirky side quests involving solving the mysteries like the lost weapons of the king Braccus Rex, it's all very fun and lays out a world that is very lively and full of wit; just like you would want from a dungeons and dragons adventure. The characters that join your party are funny and interesting and grow on you after a time so that you don't want to replace them.\r\n\r\nThis game is an investment! I'm 25 hours through and just finished act 1. But if you liked BG3 then you presumably know what you are getting into. Buy it!",

        "review": "My introduction to Larian Studios, Divinity Original Sin II is a story rich game that is definitely worth the price and more. The origin characters' intros (save perhaps one or two, you'll know them when you hear them) might come off exceptionally dry, but getting a full party of 4 with them means they'll have personal stories in every major area of the game. For immersion, I recommend starting as one of the origin characters to really feel like you are part of the world (rather than an insert with a random history).\r\n\r\nTrial and error is greatly encouraged in this game: respeccing (at least your party members) is pretty straightforward, especially going into Act II and beyond, and the game usually autosaves before a potential fight encounter (often serving as a \"pay attention!\" cue). Many puzzles are very difficult to solve first try, with most having at least some in-game clues as to how to resolve them. The combat system will take some getting used to, especially when it comes to party composition. It's not as straightforward as \"bonker\", \"magic bonker\", \"range\", and \"magic range\", as there is a plethora of magic Area of Effect (AoE) skills that can friendly fire and/or turn the environment into a disadvantageous one for both friend sand foe. \r\n\r\nAll in, would highly recommend. Just be aware, while the Switch versoin is very playable (and was my first platform for playing it ), the loading and saving times are significantly higher on the Nintendo Switch version, and you cannot earn Steam achivements while playing on the Switch as far as I'm aware.",

        "review": "I love Baldur's, and played this game a decent amount too before Baldur's Gate 3 came out... Don't get me wrong, I think Larian is a great company, so don't shoot me for this take. I think this game is intricate and has lots of cool story building and character designs. I think my main issue is completely fixable with mods, but....\n\nI can simply not get over the decision to separate the health bars into 3 sections. Base health/Physical Armor/Magic Armor. \nIf it was just resistances to dmg types that would be one thing. But without mods, say you are running a hybrid team of magic users and physical attackers you would effectively be attacking 2 separate health bars on the same enemy unit. Say I deal 50 physical damage, next turn I would need to attack a completely separate health bar as a mage before I could deal any real damage to the target. In my opinion it completely discourages hybrid playstyles and pigeon holds you into specific build types. \n\nIf you are going to play this game, get a mod that combines health bars. Otherwise, just play Baldur's Gate 3.",

        "review": "Baldur's Gate 3 reintroduced me to turn based RPG's / CRPG's after decades away and ignited a new love for these games. I wondered after BG3 finding out Larian was done with it - \"what now?\"...I want a similar amazing experience. I picked up the DOS1/2 bundle and wow!!!! I absolutely love this incredible game. It's obviously older and lacks the cinematic cutscenes and camera work of BG3 but don't let that put you off. divinity Original Sin 2 is a joy to play and a real challenge, the feeling you get from destroying an unfairly difficult boss is amazing. In my opinion \"classic\" mode in DOS2 is harder than \"Tactician\" in BG3. Some of the fights are unfair and unbalanced but then you remember - the devs gave me teleport and surrounded us with lava so it's cannon that they die in 1 shot to lava and move on. I cannot wait to start DOS1 after I am done with 2 but I am having such a good time before even activating a single gift bag mod....it will be a few hundred hours more. If you are like me and considering DOS2 after Baldur's Gate 3 then go for it - I highly doubt you will regret it and if you do - it's an actual challenge to finish the game so consider it one and add it to the highly lauded games you 100 percented!! for me this game is a 9/10 only losing a point for some unfair fights and many of the NPC's just being mean for seemingly little reason.",

The battles are strategic, fun and challenging, where player's ingenuity is able to triumph over the overwhelming advantages that the enemy possesses.\r\n\r\nWhat gets this game over the line though, is the story. Whether one experiences it as a ready made character or a player self inserted original, the story never ceases to be engaging, mysterious and intriguing. The world is so well crafted, full of fun lore and details that it is worth diving in multiple times just to experience them again and again.\r\n\r\nThe game also support up to 4 players coop, and playing with friends, each controlling a character, as they all work together or screw each other up somehow, elevate the fun even further.\r\n\r\nGet this game. Its great. Highly, very highly recommended.",

I wrongly thought driftwood was the final location before the end and ohhh how wrong i was. the game is massive with secrets everywhere. And you have complete freedom on how you want to proceed. Problem is the complete freedom also means you'll have no idea whats gonna happen the next time enemy takes their turn or fail a roll. And try not to play this using steam deck if you value time and your wrist. \nOverall if you feel BG3 is too strict, you found the next game to play around and ignite everything.",

Preferably played with some friends but also great alone, since the game features a \"lone wolf\"-feat, that allows you to reduce party-size from 4 to 2 without losing any power. \nVery recommended if you have already played BG3 ;)",

After enjoying Baldur's Gate 3 so much, I thought I would come back and finally venture forth into Rivellon and see how it was.\r\n\r\nI wish I hadn't.\r\n\r\nActs 1 and 2 are phenomenal.  They aren't free of flaws or bugs, but they are few and far enough between that none stick out more than the others.  Act 3 is when things start to turn.  The Godwoken are powerful.  It seems they were more powerful than Larian knew what to do with.  Enemies begin breaking established rules in combat, doing things the player is incapable of, and using far more action points than the player will ever have access to in a single turn.  Act 4, combat wise, is an absolute joke.  Act 3's poor combat choices just compound on themselves to the point that combat became something I would dread and get through as quickly as possible.  Not because it was difficult, but because it fucking sucked.  The only good part of Act 4 was Lohse's personal quest, which I won't be spoiling here.  Act 4 did however ensure that I will NEVER play this game again.  It quite honestly ruined the entire game for me.\r\n\r\nStory 8/10\r\nGameplay without combat: 5/10\r\nGameplay with combat: 2/10\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fun CRPG, I cannot recommend this one.  Larian does, however, seem to to learn a hell of a lot from every game they make.  Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive improvement on DOS2.  Despite me now somewhat hating DOS2, this does give me considerable hope for the next Larian game, and make me more than a little excited for it.  Maybe they'll even manage to make the last act in their next game not the worst portion of it like it was in their last two games.  Here's hoping.",

There's so much to do that it can become overwhelming, and I think the game is a bit more difficult than BG3, but it makes up for it by giving you a lot of ways to complete objectives. It's got a relatively stronger learning curve compared to BG3, but if you stick with it, it pays off.",

        "review": "\r\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 is a masterfully crafted role-playing game that has left an indelible mark on my gaming experience. The intricate storytelling, engaging combat mechanics, and the depth of companion characters are truly commendable.\r\n\r\nStory and Narrative\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is nothing short of extraordinary. The plot is rich and immersive, filled with twists and turns that kept me engaged throughout my journey. Each decision I made felt significant, influencing not only my character's fate but also the paths of my companions and the world around us.\r\n\r\n Combat and Builds\r\n\r\nThe combat system is highly strategic and rewarding, allowing for a plethora of tactical options. I particularly enjoyed experimenting with different builds alongside my friends, each of us exploring our unique playstyles. My personal favorite was a blood build that centered around corpse explosion, which was incredibly satisfying to execute. The ability to set up such devastating combinations added an exhilarating layer to the gameplay.\r\n\r\nCompanions and Their Stories\r\n\r\nThe companions in Divinity: Original Sin 2 are richly developed, each with their own captivating backstory and motivations. Their interactions and personal quests significantly enhanced the overall experience, making every moment spent in their company meaningful.\r\n\r\n Multiplayer Experience\r\n\r\nPlaying with friends was a highlight of my experience. The collaborative nature of the game fostered a dynamic atmosphere where we could strategize, share ideas, and witness how each of us envisioned our characters’ progression.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWhile my journey through Rivellon was immensely enjoyable, I found myself wishing for more content beyond level 20. The thrill of smashing more adversaries and exploring the world further was a longing that lingered long after the credits rolled. My only complaint is the desire for additional content to extend the already captivating experience.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Divinity: Original Sin 2 stands as a pinnacle of modern RPGs, combining stellar storytelling, complex combat, and memorable characters into an unforgettable adventure. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an immersive gaming experience.",

        "review": "Simply put a great game. Aside from positive and fun points I will be also describing negative points below but don't misunderstand - there is so much, much more to love about this game than to hate it. I don't see a person I wouldn't want to reccomend this game to.\n\nSoooo to start with, what I like the most in this game is that it doesn't treat you like an idiot unlike most current AAA games tend to do. You want to solve the puzzle - you've got to work for it (or google it if you feel like you cant do it ultimately. Still, that's much better than trying to solve a children level puzzle because when you finally manage to solve them you actually feel like you've accomplished something meaningful by yourself. \nThe encounters in the game actually feel hard and challenging, which I like for the most part because you can't just do a no-brain button-mash through the game. You have to think and you have to plan ahead. That being said there's also an easy mode available if that's not your cup of tea.\n\nAs for my gripes with the game, I'd say there are 3:\n1, XP gains favor being a murder hobo instead of doing the missions for most NPCs. Alternatively you can min-max this by doing missions first and killing the NPC afterwards. It kinda kills the roleplay aspect since you always need more XP and there are absolutely no ways to farm it. All XP sources are 1 time gain only.\n2. Skill/stat balance feels kinda off. Like, I made a great build for a Warfare skill (which gives passive boost to physical dmg) with high Strength melee attacker. When I tried to do the same with Finesse (basically dexterity stat) it was straight up worse damage-wise. Also, if you ever do a physical attacker without Warfare and instead with corresponding weapon type skill (i.e. 2-handed/dual-wielding/one-handed/ranged) then you lose out on damage because for apparently no reason whatsoever Warfare just scales better, even if the descriptions suggest that they give equal boost to dmg. There's also no Warfare equivalent for mages which significantly lowers raw magical damage. Mages however do have more AoE/hazard/status spells so it kinda evens out because of a higher utility factor.\n3. When you go into an encounter you're usually all grouped up, which is kinda obvious because your entire party always follows you. That's a bad thing though because you're then immediately bombarded with all kinds of spells, hazards and AoE damage. It just sucks. Enemy group on the other hand is always properly split up, all \"party\" roles are on their corresponding positions - tanks and melee near your party on ground level, mages and archers in the back, usually on some kind of towers for better coverage and high ground dmg bonuses. I lost many encounters because of this setting and had to reload a save and when I finally did sneak up everybody to their best positions, surprise surprise, I won. Really makes you wonder how fighting on (quite literally) equal grounds makes a fair and fun encounter.\n\nTo combat that, after some time I discovered the funny shennanigans that is the teleport spell. And oh man did I have a blast with this bad boy. You see, what I usually did was to split up my only mage character and sneak up to the enemy party juuuust close enough for an enemy to be in range of my teleport spell. I would then TP the enemy to the rest of my party and bascially bully him in the corner until dead. Then the rest of enemies would usually finally catch up to my group and a proper fight would unfold, but at this point they were missing a member for basically free so the fight was quite easy from that point on.\nSometimes The enemy I TPed would be far enough from others that they wouldn't even notice that I abducted a guy so I could repeat the process with another enemy shortly after. Near the end of the game I discovered that 10m distance away from an enemy is pretty much enough for a character to flee the battle. This led to a strategy of a quick abduction and all party members leaving combat once the poor guy is dead. Then I'd come back to the place of the crime and do it all over again. Puff and sting, but with magic :D\nActual cherry on top was that after all this bs with teleport I killed the last boss with it. (for context: the TPed character always takes some fall damage after the teleport and, as a side note, there is an achievement to kill someone this way). 10/10 would become a godwoken again.",

No money grabbing nonsense like important content locked behind a paywall, no microtransactions, just a complete game available immediately upon initial purchase. The game is challenging, but in a way that still allows the player freedom to experiment and explore.",

Same goes for companions.\nI got like 15 sidequests, but i dont know what to do in one of them. \nThe fights in this game are not really \"hard\", they are just unfair most of the time, what makes them \"hard\". The pure amount of items and crafting materials they throw on you is just insane. Funny that most of that stuff is just useless. Inventory managment is a pain. \n\nThis game is just not motivating at all. I really ttried to like this game, but after 32h i gave up, its impossible. Maybe if i turn down difficulty and read every single text in this game, every book/note, talk to every NPC and spend hours tto study all this i can get further... but honestly for doing this the game should be fun at least a bit.\n\nIf you are really a die hard fan of cryptic games this might be it for you. For me def not.\nI can see some qualities in this game, but more than a 5/10 i can not rate it so far,",

It's surprisingly easy to get into compared to most other CRPGs with its simplistic UI design and innovative quest design. You have full freedom to build your class the way you want, adding unique combos and also broken ways to dominate the battlefield.\n\nThe companions are all equally well-written and interwoven into the story, one aspect i don't like is how with certain choices you have to do the decision for them instead of having it designed so they would make the choice themselves depending on how you responded to them.\n\nAnd the music is absolutely beautiful and epic, especially the companion themes [b] and a certain redhead [/b]\n\nNow time for me to actually finish BG3",

I didn't tire of the effects by the end.\r\nCharacter and plot writing are pure, complex, unique, and meaty.

The story is straight-forward, well-delivered and interesting. The world building is deep and very diverse. One of my favourite part is the race's interaction toward each other.\n\nCombat is awesome, despite being turned-base, however the interaction with the environment makes it feel so fresh and new every fights.\n\nQuesting is very well-developed. Outside of following the story to escape and beat the final goal, I don't feel forced do to anything I don't want to. I can just ignore quests I don't like or even kill the NPCs who's handed the quests. Despite it sounds to make the quest meaningless but not at all. That what made me enjoy the game because I truly feel I'm living in the world and being the character, make my own decisions.\n\nI've never played DnD before. I like turn based, but easily soon-to-get tired playing it. However, I'm surprised that I'm very into DOS2 so far. At this very specific moment, my playtime is 27 hrs in already. Very recommended trying out as you could refund if it's not for you.",

        "review": "As someone who has played all 3 BG games, but little experience in tabletop, I absolutely love this game. The rule book used for this game is so much easier to follow and lends to the small struggle I had playing BG 1+2. BG 3's rule book was a lot easier to navigate but DOS makes it much easier to do the math before dealing and receiving damage. I'm still on the island so I know bigger spells are coming but at this moment the spell and ability list is not overwhelming with possibilities. I know a lot of DND journeyman love that about them but for a layman, it makes for less pressure and more enjoyment of the story and world laid out in front of me. \nAnd that's not even mentioning the story! I will admit, I didn't start with DOS1, but I don't think it takes away at all from this game. (I started with BG2 also heh) The story and lore are intricate and elicit large emotions, pulling me in every day for hours. The characters are beautiful, unique and their backstories are very interesting! (I'm running as Sebille with Ifan as leader, Fane and Prince boy) I am able to play this game for 9 hours a day and I never get bored. The scenery is gorgeous and detailed. What can I say? I'm in love with this game.",

If you name any RPG or CRPG 99 out of 100 times armor will be a percentage based damage reduction, with this game, and the original, being the only two games to ever implement this mechanic in a CRPG. On top of this, despite the fact that this game uses AP (action points) it still fells skilless to play. Kiting is impossible because you're either thrown into tiny areas, or the enemy has 8 dashes and infinite range on any non-melee attacks.",

I don't know that I've ever had to Google so much to figure out where to go or what to do in a game, but all of that aside, I'm honestly enjoying myself a lot.

        "review": "I have a HATE HATE - LOVE relationship with this game. I played Baldurs Gate 3 before, and world wise it really holds its own. Although it feels lower budget (lacking animations and VA.) I feel the love and passion in this game that went into building the masterpiece a few years down the line. The first 20 hours(fort joy) are absolutely amazing, making you think its a masterpiece. \n\nHowever, this game is not a masterpiece. After act 1 I seriously struggled getting through it. This game does not hold your hand. It does not even teach you the ropes, in fact it throws you in the pool as an infant and expects you to swim, it also never lets up. The combat for one(classic), was always a struggle. Never through out the story are you at parity with the enemies. They are always a few levels ahead oneshotting you. With that youd expect encouragement with smart creative gameplay? No, the pathfinding is absolutely atrocious, in ways that make you wanna pull your hair out. Wanna shoot an arrow or spell at an enemy ever? A 5 inch fence will block you when, a puddle of piss is apparently an obstacle when you are shooting STRAIGHT. With that, the level design is horrid, often boxing you in and not letting you use your abilities in any meaningful way while the AI gets advantage on almost every incline and gap through a wall. Oh and how dare I forget about the elements, there are barrels everywhere, and EVERY encounter turns into a California forest fire. You could be in the ocean and still catch on fire! Really, the game practically begs you to cheat every fight with how tedious they are. The funny thing is your supposed to be Godwoken!\n\nIts not only the combat that is unforgiving and tedious. Much of the games stories and content devolves into a \"how the hell would I know that?\" while playing. I've never had to use a guide until this game, where there are multiple missions which require a hyper specific thing to advance. One requiring a painting across the map to be placed on a pedestal and there was 0 guidance by the story. I like choices, but when most of the quests turn into an OJ simpson investigation as the player searches every random text, it gets tedious.\n\nI can tell this was made with love and passion and thats what counts... but I suppose playing BGS3 beforehand left a harsh taste in my mouth which is not fair to the game completely. Thats the thing, BGS3 fixed every problem I mentioned above, so ive played and seen better. Seriously if not for the aggravating combat, its up there for the first act. I encourage you to play Baldurs Gate over this.",

        "review": "Overhyped game. Most gamers didn’t even bother to finish it. Out of 80% who started the game, only 10% completed it.\n\nI admit most problems were my own, but only because the game miscommunicated with me. It is my first ever game from Larian. I was leveling up my characters correctly, but my composition was wrong. I had an Inquisitor, Rogue, Crossbow guy, and Enhancer—three physical and one magic damage dealers. And I did not have a good time. Because of the shield system, the Enhancer was useless. Enemies are really tanky, and she couldn’t destroy magic armor quickly enough to use spells. You really need to specialize in one type of damage or divide your group into 2 physical and 2 magic damage dealers. At first, it wasn’t a big deal, but the more I advanced in the story, the more problematic it became. I spent 15 hours understanding that. I think I am close to finishing the first act and escaping from the island, but who knows? The game is lengthy. And now I’m irritated. On the one hand, I want to restart the game with the correct company or push through the first act and respec my heroes later, but I will have to learn new skills again. It bothers me that you have to know this in advance or read some guides, or maybe I’m just dumb. Or all of it.\n\nObviously, the game isn’t awful; I wouldn’t spend so much time on it otherwise. The world is beautiful, every line of dialogue is professionally voiced, and there are so many possibilities and attention to detail. There is some inconvenience with the interface. I think it was caused by co-op. The inventory is shared, which is nice, but you still have to juggle items around. You see, only one character will receive a discount from the trader, not the whole group. You completed a quest, now the trader likes you more, but only one hero, not the rest. And now your main character got some discount, but your other guy has the barter skill, and you can’t transfer items between your characters in the trading menu. You have to close the menu, say goodbye to the trader, open the inventory, transfer all your crap to the barter guy, switch to the barter guy, say hello to the trader, and now you can finally sell with better prices. Why? It’s so annoying. For example, I could examine every creature or item within the group if some of them have the loremaster skill.\n\nUPD\nOk, I restarted the game with pretty much the same team composition, but knowing the combat mechanics, I did a better job with skills and have now finished Act I.\n\nAmazing game! The story so far is also intriguing. On my first attempt, I missed some quests and lore dialogue options. The game is even richer and more detailed than I thought. I’m even more impressed now. And people say BG3 is better—I can’t even imagine.",

        "review": "The game requires you to go through Larian's own launcher to play it. It's obtuse, clunky, and even though there are few things to do on there it's terrible to use. Not only that but to play online you can't just skip it but instead have to set up an account on there and link it to Steam. Which for some reason doesn't ask Steam directly, nor does it open a web page, but instead opens up it's own window where you have to log onto Steam's website there. Which for me didn't work the firs time as I got an error after signing up.\nTerrible, that's the only way to describe it, it'd be much better if the whole launcher was thrown out the window.",

This games also checks all the boxes of an ACTUAL good game, such as(in no particular order):\r\n-Good story\r\n-Good gameplay design\r\n-Good soundtrack\r\n-Pretty visuals and artstyle\r\n-And last, but not least: Freedom to play however you want, fuck up, suffer the consequences and come back for a guide.\r\nThe only real gripe that comes to mind(at least for newer players) is how the leveling and xp gain is structured, so doing exploration and side quests is not encouraged, it's MANDATORY. I'm not saying that side content isn't enjoyable, I'm just warning any potential new players that you have to scour the map, or take all the fights underleveled, which isn't ideal for you as a beginner.\r\nFew words about gameplay:\r\nOutside of combat its pretty much the same as Baldur's Gate 3 and other games in the genre. I recommend having a few mobility skills for both combat and exploration, since you can't really jump on your own, and you'll need to jump a lot.\r\nIn combat, just like in certain other \"based character RPG\" you're encoraged to abuse elemental reactions to do big damage and CC your enemies, once you break your enemies magic armor, remember that cryo is always far more effective in the rain, so if it isn't raining, cast the rain yourself. On serious note though, while there are no hard classes, you're heavily encouraged to pick a niche for every character(or even entire party) and give everyone some CC abilities or spell combinations, like mentioned above.\r\nJust like Baldur's Gate 3, the game has 6 origin characters to serve as your companions, or if you wish, your PC. And fairly early on, you have to lock in 3 companions of your choice and the others will be discarded. So here is list with small spoiler-free descriptions to hopefully help you make this choice:\r\n1. Fane - possibly the most lore heavy companion in the game, with the ability to unlock some \"unorthodox\" endings, his presence in your party is a must, as far as I'm concerned.\r\n2. Red Prince - has a lot of story content to him and overall very entertaining character to have in your party.\r\n3. Lohse - main star of some important side quests and her story about fightin her \"inner demons\" is fairly interesting. She is potential romance option, as well.\r\n4. The Beast, Ifan and Sebille. I put them together because, while they have some cool lore about themselves and background factions of the world, their story involvment is minimal beyond them commenting on the events and having some fairly inconsequential interactins with some npcs. And I guess Ifan is romanceable too.\r\nSo to finalize this section, if you're planning on only 1 playthrough, I recommend grabbing top 3 and picking one of the bottom 3 as your PC.\r\nAlso this game has crafting. It can be inconcequential. It can be broken. You can play the whole game without interacting with it. You may find some recipes in the wild. You can find some recipes by experimenting. [spoiler] But if you really want to make use of it, just google the crafting page on the games wiki and take the recipes from there [/spoiler]\r\nThis game has its shortcomings, but once you really get into it, you probably won't notice many untill you're finished with it, so go play it\r\n",

I understand you are supposed to pay attention when people are talking, but when almost every npc has a shit ton of things to say, its very had to keep track of everything. You'd literally have to use pen and paper while playing the game. Other than that, why don't the quests have goals in their descriptions? Most of them are just general statements. This is all extremely disappointing as someone who has played a TON of BG3.",

        "review": "[h1]A pathetic waste of time, effort and money[/h1]\n(And how I wished it was a bait)\n\nWell, at least I bought this on sale for 25 bucks... What a disappointment and an offense to everything that's DnD. Graphics are stunning, yes. Voice acting is cool and well made... Unfortunately the rest is utter garbage made by obese braindead idiots who never played a real tabletop RPG. Devs are probably a bunch of abomination-like boys who were bullied their entire life and decided to close themselves in a room watching RPG stuff all day for years but were so small brained to understand the foundations of what makes RPGs any good at all. When they got a job, they thought they could make games and delivered us a portion of their sheer incompetence, and an example of how to NOT develop a game.\n\nAbout Divinity 2, well... It might not appear so, but the game is awfully linear and repetitive, everything you do that would result in getting good stuff (as it would in a real tabletop) isn't anywhere near rewardable. The whole experience is in general VERY limited.\nCustomization is laughable in every aspect, killing the joy of making a character that works the way you want to and doing things as you intend. I applause their hard work on making available only the most ridiculous and shitty spells, making early game a pain instead of building your hype towards a journey of ascension.\nInstead of being what you want, you gotta build a hero that works for every poor designed 4x10 encounters you go through with shit environment mechanics that no one would ever think of implementing while running a DnD campaign. Such \"mechanics\" are the only thing you should care about, consisting in inflicting burning and poison as that's the best idea for a game that those small pp and brain fatty 45yo kiddos living with their parents could figure out, I mean, IF YOU CAN inflict status, as enemies misteriously block any affliction most of the time with their unbreakable, limitless magical armor.\nGo ranged and you lack tons of armor with your damage being \"okay\" only when playing high ground hoping that no one will notice you; go melee and you get near to 0 damage (if not applying a whole stack of buffs or chaining skills) and never ever reach ranged oponents if not charging at them; go caster and you lack even more armor than rangers feeling almost useless as staves and wands are stronger than spells. And since you never loot anything of use coherent to the point you are in the game, even the weakest enemy is strong enough to obliterate your party in 2 turns while tanking everything your party throws at them for several turns (given that you won't use poison, bleeding or burning).\n\nWith a bit of money wasted and one of the worst turn-based RPGs I've played in my entire life in my library, I only hope Baldur's Gate 3 isn't THIS BAD. I haven't played it yet and avoided watching related stuff but now I got extremely low hopes, seeing this \"studio\" made the worst possible adaptation of a system that is almost impossible to turn out bad - yet, they nailed at failing. Glorious.\nSome call BG3 the perfect RPG (very few players compared to many other gems released) but it was quickly put aside, and I barely see any spark of hype towards it anymore... Can't blame those who got tired of it, ofc.\n\nFinally, congrats devs on ruining DnD! Hail fat virgin nerds with 0 knowledge about DnD!",

Great story, many plot twists, the amont of choices is insane (combat and storywise), interesting companions with exceptional personal stories and companion quest which have various outputs and endings based on how you treat the characer and your overall choices in game.  \nPlus the graphics, enviroment and voice acting is second to none.\nKudos to Larian for substantialy improve the crafting system, skill bar and inventory managemet, compare to the first game.\n\nBut there is ONE BIG BUT... and that is the final 1-2 hours of the game in the Lucian´s temple. Larians lost it there completely, with puzzles and annoying fights. The fight with the fucking source battle dolls, for example, is the worst thing I ever experienced from Larian (and I grew up on the original Divinities). I almost uninstall the game at that point. Plus the puzzles in the Temple are plain stupid and wihtout any provided clue. If we did not have internet I really would not be able to finish the game. It seems to me (and many others) that the Larians tried here to artificially prolonged the gameplay, however the effect is completely reversed - they only really pissed me off.\nLuckily, the final fight was again great and immersive, as the rest of the game :).\n\nSo, to summ it up  9.5/10. Half point is removed purely and simply because of the shitty Lucian´s temple.",

Then this game is for you. The gameplay is very similar to baulders gate, or to be more accurate baulders gate is very similar to this game. I really enjoy the storytelling of the game and think it's very well done. My only two gripes are that the auto save is very infrequent so you should make sure to manually save often and that you can't swap out your companions until much later in the game once you leave the starting area.",

The turn based combat and leveling system is crunchy and satisfying, with endless party dynamics and strategies possible, which can be reworked anytime. Presents interesting moral choices, without losing its sense of fun or the heroism you would expect in this genre. Don't get me started on the music. Inventory is a pain. And you can't raise or lower the difficulty mid game. Endgame balance is a bit weird, and some areas don't make sense depending on with companions you chose; I'd recommend glancing at walk-throughs past Reaper's Coast (2nd Act) to cut the fluff (unless you are levelmaxing). Overall, I can't say enough. My favorite CRPG, hands down.",

This game really helped improve the summer of 2020 for me, and since I finished it I was looking forward to BG3, which also happened to be one of the best games I've ever played...\n\nIt's so good I'd buy it for a few people if I had the $$$ rn cause I see it's 70% off!",

There is so much freedom of action at the tip of your fingers and not only does the game have massive replay ability but if you plan to fully achieve it you will have too more than a few times. Long to achieve but worth every second of playtime alone or grouped. Honour mode is actually brutal if you are not sound with your strategy and using nearly everything you have access to. Get this game, get the first game, support good developers and support great games.",

Not for some snobbish or purist reason, but because it's so uncomfortable as to not be playable. It's unwieldy, for lack of a better term, and it destroys immersion. So for this game all I can do is spend hours in the masterful character creation section making cool people who I can't bring myself to play. Seriously, I have done this for a pathetic amount of time. I love the character creator! You should buy the game, because you're probably a normal person who will end up loving it. It's rated overwhelmingly positive for a reason. As for me, I have the same problem in PoE2, and I decided not to even bother with BG3. There are no other people in the world with this issue.

Its not an awful game but its nowhere good enough that it is getting this kind of praise. \r\n\r\nCombat:\r\nThe combat is a let down. 90% of the fights its always the same formular, stack physical damage or magical damage. Kill everything as fast as possible. \r\nSavescumming is recommended, you will never know what will spawn halfway into the fight. Dont bother with Magical armor and fortify buffs. Almost every encounter ends with everybody on fire. Necrofire is even worse. Fights drag on forever.\r\n\r\nWorld and Story:\r\nWorld looks nice and has some nice details for you to explore. Story is bland, most of the NPC's are douchbags. With sometimes wierd though processes on your behaviour.\r\nQuest are a mess. \"Side Quests\" are pretty much mandatory because you need the exp to progress. Everything is laid out in a specific pattern for you to progress. But you don't know what the developers had in mind. Its trial and error. \r\n\r\nRPG elements are flat, 60% of dialog ist just flavor. Only a handful of skills per class. \r\n\r\nThis is a 6/10 at best.",

        "review": "Divinity: Original Sin 2 stands as a pinnacle of modern CRPGs, offering a rich, immersive experience that pushes the boundaries of player choice and narrative depth. Larian Studios has crafted a world that's both vast and intricate, inviting players to lose themselves in its beautifully realized landscapes and complex storylines.\r\n\r\nThe game's greatest strength lies in its commitment to player agency. From the robust character creation system to the myriad ways quests can be approached and resolved, Original Sin 2 consistently empowers players to shape their own adventure. The turn-based combat system is a masterclass in tactical depth, rewarding creativity and strategic thinking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nVisually, the game is stunning, with detailed environments that range from lush forests to foreboding dungeons. The attention to detail extends to character designs and spell effects, creating a feast for the eyes at every turn.\r\n\r\nThe writing deserves special praise, with well-developed characters, engaging dialogue, and a main plot that weaves personal stories with world-shaking events. The voice acting brings these characters to life, adding depth and personality to even minor NPCs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the game is not without its flaws. One contentious aspect is the \"true protagonist\" concept, where one character is designated as the central figure of the main storyline. While this approach allows for a more focused narrative, it can feel restrictive for players who prefer a truly open-ended role-playing experience where any character could be the hero of the story.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the recurring \"shipwreck opening\" scenario, while a staple of the series, may feel somewhat tired to returning players or those familiar with RPG tropes. This cookie-cutter beginning can detract from the otherwise innovative and varied nature of the game.\r\n\r\nDespite these minor gripes, Divinity: Original Sin 2 excels in almost every other aspect. The multiplayer mode is seamlessly integrated, allowing for cooperative play that enhances rather than detracts from the narrative experience. The game's systems interlock in fascinating ways, encouraging experimentation and rewarding curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack, composed by Borislav Slavov, deserves special mention. It's an emotive, adaptive score that enhances the game's atmosphere and emotional impact.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a landmark achievement in the CRPG genre. While the \"true protagonist\" concept and the repetitive opening scenario may not appeal to all players, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise exceptional game. Its deep systems, engaging combat, rich storytelling, and commitment to player choice make it a must-play for any fan of role-playing games. Larian Studios has set a new standard for what CRPGs can achieve, crafting a world that begs to be explored, characters that demand to be known, and stories that will linger long after the credits roll.",

После первого прохождения я был уверен, что пропустил не так много... Однако сев за второй заход, я все еще открывал для себя что-то новое: незамеченный квест, какой-то уникальный лут, ну и также закрывал квесты и файты которые провалил.\r\nКоличество и качество часов. проведенных в этой игре должно стать эталоном для игровой индустрии. Взять тот же обучающий начальный остров, в котором смело можно застрять часов эдак на 20, чисто из любопытства изучая всевозможные пути выбраться из треклятого форта.\r\nЯ не жалею о часах, что провел в этой игре, что редкость для меня. Я прошел игру два раза, и уверен точно, пройду и третий, и четвертый... Настолько прекрасен Ривеллон, настолько кайфово возвращаться в него снова и снова.\r\n",

It turned into a 100-hour grind of just organizing my crap. I wasn’t battling dragons, I was battling my own OCD. They hand you the keys to a magical world, but surprise—your main quest is rearranging your damn inventory like some kind of fantasy janitor.\n\nIf you're the type who loves getting lost in every little detail and could spend hours making sure your loot’s lined up just right, knock yourself out. But if you're like me and would rather be out adventuring instead of alphabetizing your magic junk drawer, maybe give this one a pass. It’s a masterpiece for anyone who gets off on micromanaging, but for the rest of us, it’s like trying to enjoy a five-star dinner while compulsively rearranging your silverware.\n\nNot for moi,\n[b]MB[/b]",

I decided to try Divinity: Original Sin 2, mostly to support the studio, never expecting to find myself falling head over heels in love with it even more than BG3. But here I am, completely smitten!\n\nThe story is nothing short of incredible. It's clear that Larian Studios truly flexed their creative muscles here, delivering a narrative that's rich, engaging, and full of twists that left me in awe. Each companion's story is so intricately woven and deeply thought out, making it impossible not to get emotionally invested in every character's journey.\n\nAnd the mechanics? Divinity: Original Sin 2 takes what’s great about BG3 and adds even more layers. The crafting system is a blast, adding a whole new dimension of strategy and customization. Plus, the freedom to explore and experiment is something I didn’t realize I needed until I had it.\n\nBut let's talk romance—wow. I thought BG3 had some steamy scenes, but Ifan in Divinity: Original Sin 2? He had me straight-up blushing! The romance is written with such passion and depth, making those moments feel intimate and real. I adore this game and the heart that was clearly poured into every aspect of it.\n\nIf you loved Baldur’s Gate 3, do yourself a favor and play Divinity: Original Sin 2. You might end up like me, falling even harder for this gem of a game. Larian has outdone themselves, and I couldn’t be happier to have discovered this masterpiece.",

Combat is engaging and very free form allowing for creative solutions. The game follows good logic, multiple ending and outcomes for ever situation it seems. Very high replay value. I suggest playing with the origin characters they add a lot of character and story to your adventure you’ll miss out if you play a custom character. Good pacing for acts 1,2, story kind of falls off in act 3 but is still very good. Fantastic voice acting and iconic music, the biggest down side I felt was itemization which is typical of Latina studios, you will spend multiple hours moving items from your characters inventory to your chest which is so annoying but you will get used to it and will become part of the prepping for the next adventure. Everything considered this is an amazing game that anyone can enjoy (seriously) great experience!",

Baldurs Gate 3 is good, don't get me wrong, but when you compare the mechanics of DnD to the system they have here, this one is far more enjoyable. It's not perfect (God I miss jumping and shoving), but this game does more correctly, imo.\r\n\r\nThe story, personally, is more captivating. You start in similar ways, but the companions are much much more interesting to explore, and I found myself way more hooked in this one, than BG3. I do want to stress that BG3 is a great game, but I think Larian really cooked on this one.",

        "review": "Somehow this game feels more like a prequel than a sequel to the original Divinity game. Combat is severely dumb downed to the point where you wonder whether the developers took the time to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the the combat in the previous title rather than saying screw it and strip the game of what it great in the first place and then slap a few bandaids on - \n\nEg. in the first game, the player tended to simplify fights by locking down enemies with CC and whittling their HP down which led to a stale combat loops of applying CCs every turn while the enemies just stands there and stares at you. The only downside to such a strategy is that the CC abilities have a chance to miss and thus cannot be entirely relied upon. However, the developers apparently looked at that and thought to themselves- why not just implement a armor system where players would have to inflict enough damage to break that armor before they were able to apply the CCs onto the enemies? As it turns out, having armor on 99% of the enemies is a bad design choice(yes even puny little imps with no clothes on) have armor because why not) because it waters down the uniqueness and flavor of each ability in the game. You could have an potentially creative combo to approach a fight but NOPE, the spells just do the same thing as long as the enemy has their shields intact. Launching a boulder at the enemy's face has the EXACT same effect as firing an electric bolt from your fingertips thanks to this asinine armor system. Why even implement interesting synergistic spells when you handicap the player and prevent them from engaging with them? \n\nOne might defend the new armor system by saying: just break the armor first then like the developers intended then do whatever you want to the enemies. But here lies the biggest problem- the process of stripping enemies' armor tends tear into the the actual HP bar and makes it so by the time the enemy is exposed; they are already at the brink of death so why not just invest everything purely into damage and kill the enemy before they can even react instead of figuring out synergies between different status effects. \n\nThis leads to another glaring issue that I personally am surprised the developers have not discovered during playtest which is that the game is basically heavily incentivises the player to go all in on damage to kill off enemies before they can touch you and ignore defense because CC and status effects are impractical in this game because the enemies are able to chain CC you much more effectively that you can do the same to them due to them either overpowering you in terms of sheer numbers or simply having more action points in most fights. In fact, during my first playthrough, I had to respec my party to focus solely on damage rather than survivability for the unfair final boss battle and I ended up one shotting the boss on my first turn and skipping the second phase, which really goes to show the extent to which the game favors nuking the enemy and not playing the game any other way. Unfortunately for players who enjoy a bit of variety in their playstyles(tanks, healers, etc), this game does not seem to cater well to them at all. \n\nTLDR: do not be deceived by the fans who claim the second game is far superior than the first, they are likely the ones who started with the second game and could not adjust to different mechanics in the first and gave up straight away.",

        "review": "It's the perfect D&D simulator. I can't decide what is better: The relaxed and satisfying turn-based combat system or the gripping lore, voice acting and story that bring you in to a thrilling and unique fantasy world.\r\n\r\nBetween my first play through in 2017 and second play through now, I can safely say that it's one of the best games I have ever played, and is every bit as good as, if not better than the first Divinity: Original Sin game.\r\n\r\nThey hired better voice actors with slightly faster speech patterns that don't bore you as much as in the first game.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did not like over the first game was the addition of source points. It always bugged me how you get up to 3 slots and all of the best moves use this very finite resource. One workaround for this is to find at least 3 pyramids, put a pyramid next to a big vat of source and while venturing out put another pyramid down after combat and teleport to refill your source points.\r\n\r\nBut this is minescule. The game is 100% feature complete, like how games used to be. No DLC, no microtransactions, no expansions or any other bull crap. When you buy the game, you buy the whole game and that's it. That's how it should be.\r\n\r\nBesides that, it's great. The combat, items, crafting, loot. Everything is balanced perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf you like Chess, you will love this. If you like Baldur's Gate, you will love this. If you have a neck beard, you will love this. If you like Skyrim, you will probably love this.",

While a good deal more difficult and obtuse than Baldur's Gate 3, it's a steep improvement over Divinity Original Sin. The voice acting (narration included) was fantastic from start to finish, and the story, while largely your predictable high-fantasy fare, threw a couple of twists in that I didn't see coming. The characters are all very well written and interesting, especially once you start diving into their individual side quests. I loved the character development in each party member (especially The Red Prince's and Fane's), and while I typically don't revisit games once I've beaten them, I'm very much looking forward to taking another run through this excellent RPG down the road,\n\nEdit: It's worth noting that I played through the majority of this game on my Steam Deck and it runs almost flawlessly out-of-the-box.",

        "review": "As an achievement fan, this was one of the more tedious ones.  Due to my own poor planning, I ended up having to do four complete playthroughs over 169 hours to get 100%.  My mistake was thinking I could use my honor mode run to get both of Ifan's achievements with him as a follower--that may have been possible but too risky for an endgame honor mode run, for me.  Honor mode is hell, you'll want to be extremely overpowered for everything and your build will need to be well planned from the build screen.  Going Lone Wolf with two characters is far and away the best path, IMO.  For 100, recommend 3 runs, 1 with Lohse main, 1 with Fane main, and 1 with Ifan main.  Good luck",

Amazing with friends and the combat is great. If you're coming from BG3 expect a little bit more of a challenge in my opinion. The story is just as well written as BG3 and so is the combat. 100% don't wanna miss out on this gem if you have played BG3.",

The combat is engaging, the world is interesting, there's great storytelling, all that.\r\n\r\nBut what's the fucking point if the big finale bugs out in a completely unpredictable and unavoidable way?\r\n\r\nI've spent the past 3-4 months working through this game, I got to the point of no return last night, and decided to wait till this morning to have my big epic finale that I've been building to for months. \r\n\r\nAnd then it just wouldn't work. No matter what I tried, the enemies just wouldn't attack me. I kept whacking their inanimate bodies until they went unconscious, and eventually killed the correct one which triggered the end of the game. I didn't get any big cool epic fight that I've been waiting for. All the allies I made and quest lines progressed to help me in this fight were pointless. I couldn't use Anathema, Sir Lora never got to fire off his acorn spell, and the actual final boss never even spawned.\r\n\r\nLarian, what the hell? I know what you guys are capable of. It's clearly demonstrated in this game, in DOS1, and in BG3. How, after 7 years, is such a game breaking bug still here?\r\n\r\nI was actually planning on replaying it on an easier difficulty since I did tactician which slowed me down and made me lose interest in the story at some points due to the menial nature of some combat encounters. But now, I have no desire at all to replay this game. What if I invest another 100+ hours just to have all momentum fall off a cliff at the end???\r\n\r\nSeriously, this is just sad. How can you deliver such an amazing game and allow all of that to be so thoroughly ruined by such a game-breaking bug? I literally feel like months were wasted.",

        "review": "Mixed feelings about this game.\n\nOverall i'd say it's above average. Lacks polish in certain areas, i.e. whatever is coded for the inventory scrolling with mouse wheel feels quite buggy, scrolling slow / stuttery or deciding to go back at the start of list or randomly scrolling the opposite direction i'm trying to go, or not scrolling at all.\n\nSometimes may get stuck in loading screen.\n\nI preferred the combat / character building in the first Divinity OS. Graphic-wise it also had more contrast between different items and environments making it easier to spot poison and other surfaces,  along with furniture/things.\n\nI've had and played this game since Early Access.\n\nThey attempted to make the tone more serious but couldn't stay consistent in it. \nIt's like they started with the idea of a more serious/grim scenario, serious epic art style, world, soundtrack but then during development they either forgot or changed hands working on it and and started adding more silly/light hearted elements with the voice acting, origin characters and other stuff they added along the way on top of the base grim world.\n\nMost of characters feel like they don't take seriously the world they are in, in particular your companions. You could be in a blood soaked room with cadavers everywhere the environment and sountrack give off a dangerous vibe but then the characters would crack light toned comments or talk like they are taking a picnic stroll. It is rare if anybody is ever on edge or takes the situation they are in appropriately.\n\nLohse almost killed an npc? Shrugs it off and avoids the topic.\nSebille steps in while you are having a conversation and murders the npc? No big deal.\nExploring and looting torture chamber with a maniac torturer across the room? Fane is over there commenting on a portrait, talking about artistic rights.\nSomeone tries to assassinate Red Prince for the 12th time? Oh no big deal, actually just an annoyance.\n\nAlmost every voice actor, even for animals has an accent (british? not sure) in some cases it's so heavy/forced which i find grating to the ears. I think i recognize voices from the first Divinity OS but here the accent is way more pronounced. Everytime i start a new playthrough i want to strangle Magister Siwan whenever i hear her talking.\n\nThe narrator sounds like they are from the Teletubbies show, or reading a children's fable, hearing him saying comments like \"did you expect a needle?\" with almost a puzzling/mocking tone while i'm checking an hay stack in a sinking ship or in a bloody dark prison was completely out of place.\n\nThe voice acting doesn't fit and with the rest of theme and art style of the game. I tried to play the game without voice sounds and it completely changes how the conversation and characters are perceived.\n\nSo does talking to animals, as almost all of them have cringe silly voices or dialogues (if you have the ability to talk to animals).\n\nThen early in game, your character who is a prisoner survive a ship wreck literally by miracle and wake up on an island  (which was the ship's destination btw). Almost everybody from the ship has died, except some of the prisoners, so even if you guys survived you are still in a shitty situation, wearing rags, barefooted, using makeshift weapons. \n\nThe Soundtrack and environment give off the idea that you have to survive on this island and the situation is bittersweet, but then you meet a cat who sounds stoned, they follow you without even knowing why and in the Definitive Edition they added Sir Lora whom you meet early in the game, a squirrel wearing a skull helmet and riding an cat skeleton, talking something about an invasion of giant Acorns(??) so the tone consistency goes out the window meanwhile not even a few meters ahead there are other prisoners all wearing rags and probably starving, awaiting for their sentence and some are hoping to escape the place. The game keep having this conflicting tones where you are supposely in a somewhat grim scenario but then they add in silly non serious stuff.\n\nI didn't have this issue with the first D:OS, because the tone overall was more consistent.\n\nBut here with the more serious soundtrack and theme it's like they tried to put oil with water.\n\nThe way the armor system works in this game makes physical and magical damage have absolutely no synergy with each other.\n\nDifference of levels compared to enemies make an huge difference, when you are still building up core talents, gear and passives/skills.\n\nYou can't hard CC enemies until you deplete their physical or magical armor. later on (but not so late) almost all enemies will start having teleportation, ranged or jump skills making defensive positioning/kiting less relevant. I.e. who had the idea of giving ranged oil boulder throwing skill to crocodiles or turtles..? Shield characters get a ranged throwing skill early on which they'll use right away meaning they'll be able to hit you from a distance on their first turn.\n\nSo when you encounter higher level enemies it's almost guaranteed you can't CC in the first turns cause of their huge armor. Encounter with enemies of higher level almost feel not possible or at huge disadvantage.\n\nIt also tends to turn into a gank/focus on target fest to finish them off quickly after you manage to CC them and ignore the rest of enemies since they still have their armor values on so you can't hard disable / CC them anyway.\n\nIn the first Divinity OS, you could deal with higher level enemies by keeping the distance, CC and use of other skills. Melee enemies would have to walk/run toward your party and archers/mages would keep their distance. If you approached the archers they'd switch their weapon to melee. Zombies would have to approach party to melee range.\n\nIt is better to have your group use either all physical or all magical type of damage / CC.\n\nMost encounters are solved with combat, which is often forced on the player (you can't talk your way out of it). This pushes player to hunt for more experience and levels before approaching certain places as they'll have to inevitably fight.\n\nEnemy AI in combat is too smart in some cases. Feels like i'm playing against a pvp AI, they go and focus the squishiest target and if you put reflect damage on your characters or high resist they'll just ignore them.\n\nIn the first D:OS enemies would still try to use poison on your zombie character, and wouldn't blatantly ignore your character just cause they couldn't damage them properly. There were nice things like headless zombies who would act erratic and swing the air (since they are headless and they can't see).\n\nExperience to gain levels is limited, you'll gain from killing certain npcs, exploring areas, triggering events or certain decisions you make during quests or dialogs.\n\nA certain course of action rewards better exp than others, and since the gains are limited throughout the game it makes it feel less rewarding to play a certain way. Some decision reward less or no exp. WIki comments are full of tricks on how to maximize / loot and exp gain for this reason.\n\nIt is also quite dangerous to approach a combat undergeared and underleveled.\n\nThere is an \"ideal\" order in which to do things, for example if you go to certain places you'll miss out events happening somewhere else, or some npcs may be already dead by the time you arrive, the order in which to do these things is not clear on a first playthrough. You can also potentially gain extra exp by being present during an event/cutscene or traveling to places in a specific order.\n\nThe game is not easy enough to ignore extra levels/experience, depending on how you approach combat. Unless you want to cheese encounters with ambush or or other tactics combos which i'm not gonna mention here.\n\nThe limited experience gain affecting gameplay decisions (and ruining roleplaying) along with the bad armor system are what bothered me the most and prompted to write an early review.\n\nMay update it if i complete the whole game.",

        "review": "I've played Divinity RPGs since the original Divine Divinity over 20 years ago. The series has always had personality and worlds just jam packed with interesting encounters, then Original Sin 1 experimented with turn-based combat and co-op. They used a vibrant elemental system where you can, for example, create a rain cloud to drench an area, then use lightning to stun anyone inside the puddles. This made it too easy to stun-lock enemies (or for them to stun-lock you) for a really long time, so the sequel adds armour which must be whittled down before somebody can be crowd controlled. They also smoothed all the bugs out of co-op, allowed 4 players, and even encouraged players to compete with each other and see each other as rivals. \n\nOriginal Sin 2 is the culmination of everything Larian has learnt in over 20 years of making RPGs. Personally, I prefer it to Baldur's Gate 3 as it isn't limited to the annoying D&D combat system, and all the characters aren't over the top and horny. My only potential criticism is that, as with all modern Larian games, the first act of the game is of the utmost quality because it is playtested so much but then you start to notice a slow drop in quality the further you go in. Not that later parts are bad per se, they just don't have the magic that the early areas do.",

I do want to predicate this by saying i was playing on Honor mode, which I do understand is very unforgiving as this mode does not allow any failure, once the team is dead, the game is over, no saves.\r\nHowever, spoiler coming ..... there is a room in a late juncture in the game whereby the room freezes the team, and in 30 seconds, you're all dead.\r\nMy 161 hours went poof in a matter of 30 seconds.  I know some of the readers of this post will say well, you should have expected the worse on Honor mode; but i disagree, any area that a game player enters and have 30 seconds to react or death is a bit unreasonable to me; unless its lava ... but a cellar ? come on.\r\n\r\nIn any case, some of you may feel Honor mode is reasonable, but as much as I liked the story and narrative, I can't in my right mind, spend another 160 hours to get back to this point; I have to vote down this game; I m done.",

        "review": "I think I am near the end of the game now, and man it has been an amazing journey and I only wish there was more and the last act wasn't rushed.\n\nDivinity Original Sin 2 stands tall as one of the greatest RPGS ever made, this game deserves more recognition and credit. The world and setting(s) they have created in this game are truly fascinating and are incredibly diverse. The locations remind me of a fantasy game, however it has its own unique twist and flair to it.\n\nThe characters in this game, especially the companions are incredibly well written and very worth your time learning and understanding. Each companion has a different reaction to the actions you commit in this world and they all have their own usefulness and negatives in combat. It is not so simple as \"a mage can heal but not do other mechanics\". You have full control over how to spec your companions and character, I made a necromancer knight and it was incredibly viable throughout the whole game and never felt pressured by the game to doing something else. \n\nThe story in D:OS2 might be my most least favourite aspect, it starts of very strong and engaging, and peaks at act 2 with branching story lines and engaging content and characters that make you keep playing late into the night wondering what is going to happen. However, during the later acts of the game, the story definitely starts to weaken a fair bit, the plot becomes confusing and wrongly paced and it becomes a point where you say to yourself \"I just want to get this done with now\". The constant puzzles and drawn out battles in act 3 just to drag out the playtime were not helped by the constant backtracking for certain items that game had not clear were necessary to progress the story. However, the combat and exploration is still incredibly rewarding and fun, so it evens out. If you are one to get burned out quickly, this game will not be for you at all.\n\nOverrall, D:OS2 stands tall as a great game which has an incredible amount of quality content, paired with well-written characters and an interesting map. However, certain hindrances such as the fall off of the story, and the weirdly paced later acts and drawn out puzzles and battles must be noted.\n\n9/10. Great game.",

I was that person, i bounced off this game twice, but on my third attempt something just clicked and its been great ever since. This game has depth, story, exploration, beautiful graphics(does not look 7 years old). Every character is unique and full of witty dialogue. \r\n\r\nBonus for those who have 32:9 monitors, this game works great at these super wide resolutions. I can not reccomend this game enough to anyone who likes RPGs even those who dont normally play turn based.",

You actually care about what happens to them. The combat is awesome too; I would say probably even better than BG3. It’s turn-based, and there are so many ways to approach each fight, including interactions between elements, assassination, and terrain effects. The graphics might be outdated in 2024, but the music is definitely on point. If you’re into RPGs, this game is a must-play.",

I do not like the combat, you are on fire 90% of the time, I don't care for most of the skills, can't get into the story, it looks horribly, there aren't that many RP opportunities either, I had a few moments where I was basically railroaded by the devs to do something, most replies are either giga good person or an asshole.\n\nI'll probably try again, after all, I'm almost at act 2 or whatever, but i'd be lying if I wasn't forcing myself to play.\nTrust me, I see the appeal and I understand why people love this game but it's not for me. I'll take my action, bonus action and movement any day over this idiotic system\n\n[EDIT]\nFinished the game. Absolutely horrible. I retract my statement about understanding why people love this.

        "review": "everything is bad, and insanely slow. there are no quests so you have to retard around the map and see if you can do something or not instead of just going where you are supposed to because the game its meant to play in a specific order, so its just an insane amount of wasted time and you also have to just remember everywhere that you went and how much you completed everything in every inch of the map. characters move very slowly, every cast is slow and the fights are insanely long especially when an enemy is running from you and you run after them and they run again and you want to smash the keyboard because you wasted 5 minutes on killing a random mob, the Ai is very bad, shooting behind walls that you cant shoot from, all fights are just annoying and boring. the main characters that you can play are okeyish but all other characters are insanely forgetable. the amount of reading you have to do is insane the books that you have read dont say that you already read them, you get like 7 dialog options for everything, insane amount of wasted time since most answers do the exact same thing. not being able to see the whole map if you are inside something is annoying. too many useless items , you even have to read all item to pick. you also have to remember like a dialog or book from 10 hours of gameplay ago to do a \"puzzle\", all \"puzzles\" are horrible shit.the amount of missclicks that happen because a character moves to \"breathe\" are so frustrating and is stupid. you have to spam quicksave and do manual saves because they couldnt be bothered to make a time interval autosave and you can lose ten hours of gameplay. the camera is very bad. the story is just bad. The game is a huge waste of time and life one of the worst games ive ever played, straight  garbage, farming the same lvl in a gacha game feels less tidious than playing this shit like 80% of the time it doesnt feel like playing at all. fk all the 10/10 reviews. why cant people give a score to the game like on GOG the game has like a 3.4/5 which is way better than this \"overwhelmingly positive\" shit, I am overwhelmingly disappointed whit this garbage game",

There's so much love and effort that was gifted to this game, from my entirely bug-less play-through to never-ending creative, amusing and deep writing. The characters are extremely memorable from one another, and you have the ultimate freedom to go about your adventure the way you see fit. Me? I had to bring the red Prince to Divine. That chair is fit for royalty! \n\nBut really, if you fancy RPGs, don't hesitate to pick up this title. There is so much adventure within, waiting for you to experience, and you won't regret it! I would recommend this game even when not on sale, as what it has to offer offsets the cost! (And I'm a fairly strict 'only buy when on sale' guy myself!) Definitely among my top favorites I've ever experienced. On to Baldur's Gate 3 for me! Support this studio!",

I have two complaints though, the quality of life is generally poor, not being able to see what books you have and have not read is just... awful, thats just one example. Two, I havent made it far enough in the game yet to know how true this is but it feels like my armor and weapons become useless so quickly that after many hours of getting the full Tyrant set and Captains set, they become obsolete on the boat ride to Reaper's Eye, especially the Tyrant set, It makes me wonder if the Devourer's set will even be worth getting which sucks because I love the idea of cool armor sets with unique passives.",

        "review": "What an incredible turn based RPG. I've spent just less than one thousand hours on this masterpiece which means its my most played Singleplayer game in my adult life (admittedly some hours were playing multiplayer with friends but still). Now there's no way that I'm going to be able to list all the good things about this game in one review, but I'll try my best and highlight some really good aspects to hopefully encourage anyone reading this to give it a go. \n\nPros -\nFirstly, the music in this game is AMAZING. It either sounds completely badass for fights or incomparably elegant for exploring the world. There were so many times during my many playthroughs that I had to make the decision of either humming along to the music or letting my ears fully embrace those beautiful instruments. \n\nVisually this game is stunning, the details in the world and the particle effects of abilities/spells look so well done and make it feel so satisfying when you cast them. I also really appreciate that this games movement is very freeing for a turn based RPG. I've always disliked those games where movement is restricted to like a chess board with squares. Having your characters quite literally being able to move anywhere feels so much better. \n\nNext up, the story. [b]EVERYTHING[/b] has lore in this game. If you love reading and want to read pages and pages of lore, character backgrounds and potentially hundreds of books scattered across the game, then you can most definitely do so. But its not forced onto you. Most books that you find throughout the game aren't necessary to progress, and a lot of the time there will be an option to resolve problems by fighting if you prefer a little more action. Its completely up to you how you want to play. \n\nLastly, I want to talk about the character creation. The character creation in Divinity is phenomenal. Obviously you can change the look of your character to how you want but more importantly, there are 10 Skill categories that you can allocate points to. You can mix and match them together and pair them with *mostly* any type of weapon in the game. The combinations you can make are endless. For example:\n\nWant to be a persuasive fire-wizard that uses daggers instead of the usual staff/wands?\nWant to be a non-confrontational thief that escapes his enemies by turning the floor to ice causing them to slip?\nWant to be an archer that fires love arrows to temporarily make his enemies fight for him?\nWant to be a cleric wielding a giant axe who can explode corpses?\n\nWell you can have all 4 in the same party! I could talk about this game for hours but at the time of writing this these are the aspects of the game that came to mind. Now I'll talk a little bit about some very minor cons that don't put the game in any bad light but I feel are good to know anyways.\n\nVery Minor Cons - \n\nGift Bags: [b]If you don't care about achievements then move onto the next con[/b] -- Gift bags are the developers way of giving their own made mods for divinity. They are free little game mechanics that you can choose whether to enable in your game or not. (I highly recommend that you [b]do not enable any of these for your first playthrough[/b] as some make the game considerably harder/easier). Some of these settings are incredibly useful but the issue is since these are acted like mods, achievements are disabled if you enable them, so you will need to replay the game without them in order to gain any. I wish the devs would have actually implemented some of these into the base game rather than adding them as mod-like settings after.\n\nInventory: Inventory management in this game could be a liiiiiiittle better. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the inventory system, but there are definitely a few QOL changes that they could have added. One example being the ability to name bags. Throughout the game you will pick up individual bags that you can place in your inventory and put any item inside. They are incredibly useful in tidying up your inventory and reducing clutter, but these bags cannot be named. So you will end up having to repeatedly look inside each bag to find out which bags have which items. Additionally, when crafting stuff, if an ingredient is inside one of these bags, the crafted item may appear in the bag of the ingredient instead of just appearing at the bottom of your inventory for you to sort out. Again, not exactly a game-breaking problem but definitely slightly frustrating when you have lots of items in a bag and now need to find a random crafted item amongst them all.\n\nOther than whats listed above I just wish the game never ended honestly. I want more cool spells, more races, more talents, more fights, MORE OF EVERYTHING. Truly a really incredible game, please give it a go because the developers deserve it. \n\nThanks for reading <3.",

The game has been around a while now so I guess most of the bugs are fixed. I certainly didn't spot anything major.

        "review": "GG but worse than BG3 for me...\n\nSo my issues with this game:\n\n-Inventory management is trash. It was bad in Baldur's Gate 3, but at least you could select multiple items at once in that whereas you can't in this unless playing with a controller. Funny that they updated the definitive edition to work with controls and multi-item select like BG3, but I would say even better than BG3 because I like the skill bars instead of radials. I don't know why they didn't update mouse & keyboard this to have more modern QoL functions like BG3. I could play with controller, but I prefer with mouse and keyboard.\n\n-Randomized equipment and equipment management is annoying. After one level of experience, I usually have a ton of equipment. So, then I have to go through the hassle of identifying the equipment. Why can't I just see what I have, rather than taking this extra step? After identifying the equipment, I have to see if it works for any of the characters. Sometimes the random equipment (ie lots of \"mage gear\" vs warrior gear) makes me completely want to respec a party member to a different \"class\" which means having to redo all of the stats, equipment, talents, and action bars. Even if it doesn't make me want to respec, getting new equipment often still means having to go to the respec mirror to optimally adjust my stats. You'll also need to spend time removing runes from the old equipment and adding it to the new equipment. For example, I have an Archer. It has a minor dip into a few non-ranged aspects to have more mobility abilities. If I get a new piece of gear that increases my armor by a lot, but doesn't have the points in my mobility dip I have to go respec just to get the proper points in the skills I want. This is not hard, it's just very time consuming... even if you only do it once per level. I don't think the right answer is to check every piece of gear as you get it, because often you will want to respec unless the gear randomly gives you the stats it wants. The alternative is to be lazy and not update my equipment and have a lot more difficulties in combat. The last little niggle is that when you visit vendors selling gear, the gear is randomized. So you can save-scum to try and get gear that aligns with what you want for your character. This ended up being way too time-consuming and I stopped doing it. Shields are especially weird in this game because you often need a certain level of constitution to use. If you lose constitution due to a status effect, the shield will unequip. So, you've just lost a PILE of armor and stats because of a status effect when you could have just not put points into constitution and upped your intelligence by equipping another wand. You can overshoot your constitution to try and avoid this, but either, you don't unequip other gear when you lose stats or no other stats are attacked as much as constitution, which is strange. Also, mages using shields feels a little weird thematically, but I wanted to do this so they would be a bit less squishy. Often not worth the hassle with the random unequipping.\n\n-In some ways, I like the combat more in this than BG3. There seems to be a greater variety of combat abilities and status ailments. On the other hand, the combat is designed in such a way that you want to do as much damage as possible as quickly as possible so you can start crowd-controlling enemies. CC status effects basically don't happen unless the character has lost it's physical/magical \"HP\" armor bar (the type being relevant for certain effects). This leads combat to feeling pretty volatile. I also feel they leaned way too much into environmental effects. It feels like you're always walking in poison/fire/etc. Maybe I'm just too casual for this level detail in combat. The encounters feel especially swingy in the late-game (deathfog spiders, multiple trolls at once, etc). Maybe they are just encounters I should be skipping since they seem to be optional. Though, some of the story-related encounters seem pretty brutal too. Finally, there are source points & abilities. They are just points that allow you to use cool powered-up skills. The problem with this is that you can't always consistently get these points in your locale and sometimes the enemies will absorb your source points and pummel you with them. So, it makes me want to play in a fashion where I don't use these cool abilities because I don't always have access to the means of recouping these points in a non-time consuming way, the enemies can use them against you, they take up more skill slots than non-source abilities. It kinda feels like teasing you with cool things that you get punished for, when actually trying to use them. If they were just replenished after every combat rather than making you go through rigamarole to get these points back, they might feel more worth the effort.\n\nPotential issues with the genre (in terms of my preferences): ?\n\n-So many freaking items and objects to loot! This kind of ties into the inventory management. I don't know if this is typical of Skyrim/Witcher 3/etc. but after having played BG3 and D:OS2, there is just way too many items. I don't want to pick up every little thing and then have to wade through what to sell and what not to. Additionally, I hate selling random items when it could have potentially been used for crafting excellent items. So crafting in general is pretty blah. If you don't reorganize an item by its icon, good luck finding it. It's also very time consuming to pick up every little item and check every vase. This tends seems to be more common these days, as I thought both Octopath Traveller games had more gear than I was used to in JRPGs. CRPG's seem to have it more than JRPG's... or the JRPG's of yore, anyway. What's been your experience with this?\n\n-A world of freedom means I'm trying to shape destiny. This is time-consuming and I don't like looking things up online. I would just prefer to play. That said, it's annoying to make choices that affect your game in a negative way. It's easier to just save-scum and choose an alternative outcome. It's not even something I always do, but some decisions I do want to change. This also inflates the play time. Playing out a sequence, not liking the result of a choice, save-scumming and replaying the sequence or a quest giving you a choice so you read up on the outcomes so you can choose what you want. Maybe I should just be going with the choices I make regardless, but I remember playing BG3 the first time with a less save-scumming methodology and 2 of my companions storylines basically became non-existent and it wasn't even immediately obvious that things would turn out this way until 10's of hours later.\n\n-Combat save-scumming. It's annoying when you don't know a combat is coming (probably through some dialog option) and then combat surprises you and you get AOE-nuked into near oblivion because when you naturally run around with your party they stay clumped together. Sometimes you'll even try to hobble through the fight and succeed, but then when you fail, it feels like time wasted. So, then you restart the game and properly position your characters before you send someone to talk to an NPC. This particular option kind of breaks thematic immersion when you're strategically setting up your party's positions before they know they are going to get into a combat. I don't want to waste time setting up combat before I talk to any given NPC and sometimes you randomly get ambushed while walking around, so it's bound to happen.\n\n-Forced flavor text reading. What I mean by this is that in D:OS2 and BG3, you can find a whole bunch of different books. You should read these books. These books can open new quests, complete current quests, give you hints on solving a puzzle, and let you learn new recipes. I don't really want to do this. I have basically stopped reading opened the read window and immediately shut down to try and get quest/recipe triggers.",

        "review": "D:OS2 was too busy developing cutesy mechanical interactions to focus on plot or character development. The story is paper thin and stereotypical, with fairly obvious and unexciting plot twists, the dialogues and voice acting are hackneyed, and the art direction adds nothing to your run-of-the-mill fantasy setting (sometimes bordering on Blizzard-level ugly), even if the maps are sometimes quite pretty. Dialogues and player decisions often feel meaningless. The UI's awkwardness left me at times struggling to resurrect a character, or find a spell or scroll (In fact, sometimes memorized spells were unexplainably absent from the menu bar). The puzzles most often rely on arbitrary idea associations made by the developers, which players need to guess or, most likely, go online to fetch the solution. The two-tier system of power for weapons and armor (quantitative—1 to 20—AND qualitative—\"Common\" to \"Divine\") is unexplainable and only leads to awkward calculations. There are other features that retract from the experience, such as the baffling level power up of villager NPCs and enemy minions, which always match the player's leveling up as we progress in the story. Overall, the game confuses arbitrary complexity with depth. A very frustrating experience.",

I tried lowering it down from Classic to Explorer mode, which made the combat easier but not enjoyable. I looked up multiple youtube videos for pointers, but I just can't enjoy this game's combat; the whole thing about stripping an opponent's armor or magic armor and then using chain crowd control is lame as hell, and having enemies destroy you with AoE at the start of every combat if you don't manually unlink your party and reposition them is... also lame as hell. I just could not enjoy this game's combat.\n\nWhat about exploration? You go to a door, try to open it. It's locked. You try to pick the lock; your rogue's skill is too low, and your precious lockpick is gone forever. So you try to break it; now your weapon's durability is shot and it's unusable in combat. You unequip your weapon, and punch and kick the door. A hundred kicks later, it's open, and you can go into a room and pick up like 2 gold, which is a tiny fraction of what it costs to buy another lockpick. Who the hell thought this was a good idea?\n\nWhat about the characters, setting and story? Setting and story look interesting, but I didn't get very far, so I can't tell for sure. Some characters were alright, others I just wanted to murder for being total pieces of shit, like the Red Prince. I didn't actually like any of the origin companions though, like I did instantly like Lae'zel in BG3. D:OS 2 companions were just... okay, at best. Which is not too bad, and I'm sure they have interesting storylines down the road, but it's not good enough to keep me engaged and playing a game whose gameplay I've flatly disliked.\n\nClearly, many players enjoy this game, if you look at its excellent review scores... but just as many players are like me, who did not enjoy it. D:OS 2 has 97 achievements, and only 8 of them have been completed by over 50% of players. I quit halfway through exploring Fort Joy, the first town you get to right after the prologue, and got multiple achievements that only 30 or 40% of players have gotten. More than half of all players quit this game very, very early- they just don't bother to be like me, and leave a negative review on the way out. I love Larian and BG3, but I can't love D:OS 2.",

But i just wanna say for me this was probably the hardest tactical RPG i've ever played [i](if you're achieving 100% completion)[/i], beating the game in tactician mode really makes me think a lot about every action that i'm gonna do. Maybe in other games you can exploit certain fights by playing hit & run, or maybe by using the ability to sneak and one-shotting the enemy. But in here you can't really do that all the time since the game use \"Action Point\" in their turn based battle system, so you must be skilled and creative in every fight, especially the final fight towards the ending, good luck with that! But that doesn't mean this game doesn't have any cheese method, there's many, but you won't figure it out if you're not clever. Oh and you can't farm xp in here, enemies won't spawn after you kill them, so if you're trying to get the best possible xp income you'll have to check the guide but at the risk of spoilers.\n\nRegardless of the difficulty, this game is fun, like really fun, there's so much freedom in the character build, story development and many more. I really liked how the game progress each arc, every decisions you make will shape the story and how other characters will act towards you later in the game. One of the best RPG so far!",

There are a few problems however, such as there being no sprint or speed up for when you are traveling to certain parts of the map without a waypoint, or through dungeons. Then there is the fact that they have dozens of quality of life improvements but turning them on disables achievements, there is a sprint out of combat feature but using it disables achievements for that save file, a better inventory management system that disables achievements, and so on and so forth, there are some that do affect difficulty but those could still disable achievements. but enough about the gift bags. The game is great, achievements are a bit wonky with the DLC, but that does not detract from the fact that this is an amazing game and you should play it.",

The game gives lots of possibilities to make your playthrough unique.\r\n- Characters' abilities are not limited to a specific class. Giving you a lot of freedom to play however and whatever you want.\r\n- Tons of mod to play with.\r\n\r\nOverall, DOS2 is an great game and comparable to BG3. Both promised amazing experience and delivered!\r\n\r\n",

It's astonishing, beautiful and fits for every moment of game.\r\nThe game world, Rivellon, is well designed. It has different locations, biomes, landscapes and every of them is beautiful in its own way.\r\nTurn-based battle system is relaxing and helps the player have fun.\r\nAlso the main feature of battles in the game, elements interaction with themselves and the environment, is interesting and provides many opportunities for dealing with situations.\r\nThe game gives many variations for character's combat builds. With the help of variative dialog system, the first walkthrough can be different for all players. As a result the game have a big chances for multiple completing.\r\nWith all these factors in mind, it's no news that DOS2 can make you fall in love with it. And that applies to me too. Divinity is definitely my favorite RPG and one of my favorite games.\r\nThanks!",

YES!!!\r\nI started this game right after finishing BG3 to cope with the reality of having a turn-based, RPG game shaped hole in my heart. This is just the healing I need. So far the characters are endearing and well acted, the music is lovely, and the battles are fun. Expect Larian's beautiful graphics and enjoy the painstaking details applied to the rendering of every shrub, waterfall, and clump of grass. Fights look a little different from BG3, as do races, but they are familiar and D and D inspired.",

The story is intriguing, but the only issue I noticed is that despite playing on standard difficulty, I constantly find myself underleveled. I explore every corner of the map and complete all the quests I can, yet I still remain underleveled. Changing the difficulty later in the game feels like cheating, so I stubbornly didn't change it and suffered for a while because of this. Other than that, the battles are extremely fun and I enjoy them because they require some strategic thinking. Additionally, I appreciate that the game doesn't restrict the player in terms of choices; most of the time, I can choose whom to befriend or antagonize.",

People who only like action-fast paced games will not like this. It is even slower than Baldur's Gate 3. The combat in this game is challenging and engaging and takes a lot of thought and trial and error. It has a steep beginner's curve.  Overall story is vague and not that interesting. The small interwoven stories of the many NPCs and party members are excellent. It's truly a masterpiece, with very little flaw for its genre.",

It is astonishing to me that this game is so loved even though the playthrough is rather linear and mechanics of combat is split into 3 scenarios.\r\n\r\nScenario 1: you get ambushed and you die\r\nScenario 2: you have a mage with teleport and bunch of oneshotting aoe spells and you one shot the enemy\r\nScenario 3: you have a warrior with full stats into strength, 2 handed and warfare and you one shot the enemy\r\n\r\nI finished this game only in tactician mode once where the devs decide to handle the difficulty in the most boring way possible; by increasing the mobs stats into ridiculous amounts. The combats in this game are in 90% of instances an ambush which makes for a boring experience.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the story did not connect with me in any way and it was in places very dull. (which was a weird \r\n gaming experience for me because I am usually the nerd in the group getting all the lore info possible)\r\n\r\nI'd recommend anyone to do their research before buying this game. This game has 98% positive reviews, but when I looked at achievements only about 12% of the players finished the game on the easiest difficulty which makes me question the relevance of the steam review system.",

Not at all a popcorn rpg, more a tabletop game simulator, where you sit back, haggle, chat with npc, equip your characters, choose your skills carefully, in short, pamper your characters and end up getting attached to them. Very well done.\n\nThe only con is the difficulty, that is sometimes punishing. You  cant spam mindlessly spells waiting of the end of the combat. You HAVE to plan, prepare and execute with intelligence. If you dont have that patience, dont play, but you'll be missing out.",

        "review": "I bought Divinity Original Sin 2 originally because i wanted to test the waters with turn based combat before i spent the big bucks on Baldurs Gate 3. I really came to this game/genre for the choice driven narrative fun, but i ended up enjoying the turn based combat just as much if not more. It's almost like a weird game of chess, except your pieces are cherished companions with moves that you handpick and stats that you fine tune throughout the journey. \n\nThe Story grips you enough to hold your attention to see its conclusion, with some very surprising twists along the way. There is a narrator accompanying you throughout the game giving context to everything, i actually almost preferred this over cut-scenes, it was just really charming. Not to mention the writing... Larian Needs to give their writers a big raise, every single conversation and narration is just so beautifully written.\n\n Many decisions felt like they held a lot of weight, and sometimes would leave me starring at the screen in disbelief at how they would alter the course of my game, or characters fates etc. One thing that really blew me away was when my pal Mr SpoilerMaybe died, it wasn't scripted it just happened. I was overcome with rage against the Magisters and vowed to murder them all after that. \n\nA big issue i had with the game though was sometimes in the logbook it would recap things (as it does) but it wouldn't account for a decision i had made and the information would be inaccurate. Something like \"Billy killed Joe and you ran\" when in reality i killed Joe one mission ago. Or sometimes you talk to someone and they act like you have spoken to them before. This happened to me when i first arrived at Fort Joy at the start of the game. There are so many ways to complete the first quest that the paths start to overlap and get tangled and you end up talking to somebody about a plan you both conjured up in a previous conversation that never took place. These issues were few are far between however.\n\nIssues aside this game is great, from the soundtrack, writing, atmosphere, combat, choices, EVERYTHING IS GREAT. I very much enjoyed every aspect of this game, and if not for the issue i mentioned above and a really over complicated puzzle towards the end of the game, i would call it a masterpiece. \n\n8/10",

This game in my opinion has amazing world building, good story building, and fun class creation. The difficulty scaling is a bit rough even after getting used to it, the final act of the game just comes back to being absurdly hard out of no where and it shows with how few people have beaten the game (10% on normal mode). If I were to compare the difficulty to BG3 I would say normal mode DOS2 (there is an easier version, but my friends and I wanted to play it normally) is easily harder than honour mode BG3 for warning.",

        "review": "Divinity: Original Sin 2 - The Ultimate Fantasy Soap Opera\n\nOne of the best RPGs there is. 9 / 10\n\nIf you've ever wondered what it would be like to team up with most eccentric friends to save the world, then Divinity: Original Sin 2 is the game for you. From the moment you crash-land on a prison island, you're thrown into a whirlwind of drama, magic, and questionable choices.\n\nFirst off, character creation is like being a kid in a candy store. Want to be an undead lizard person that likes the dead more than the living, become a necromancer. Want to summon a beast that does everything in your place? Go for it. A dwarf polymorph? Sure, why not. The combinations are endless, and each is more absurd than the last. I spent more time on character creation than I did on actual gameplay in some other RPGs. I went through Fort Joy 3 times, cause other builds seemed more fun, until i figured out you can respec later on the ship. \n\nThe combat system is like a game of chess, where every piece is on fire, and the board is soaked in acid. It’s turn-based, which means you’ll have plenty of time to plan your next ridiculous move. Get a barrel from your inventory, misclick, and see your party go down in flames. Rethink your choices, reload and do the same stupid shit you did before. Make a devious plan with your friend, teleport them near the enemy and see them get electrocuted in static mist...oops...\n\nBut once your combo goes they way you planned, you will feel like a GOD that can do no wrong.\n\nSpeaking of friends, the multiplayer mode is where the game truly shines. Nothing brings people together quite like a heated argument over who gets to be the talking squirrel’s best friend or why your buddy thought it was a good idea to throw a teleportation pyramid into a pit of lava. \n\nThe story is engaging, filled with plot twists and moral dilemmas. After every interaction with NPC, you wonder if other option was better and what cool stuff you missed. \n\nThere are some cons. Leveling system is quite confusing, physical armor and magic armor is quite the disappointment from DOS1. Knockdown is the most important thing to do, everything else is secondary.\n\n*shudder* The oil field fight.. *shudder*\n\nIn conclusion, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a wild ride of hilarity, strategy, and pure fantasy joy. Whether you’re summoning an army of totems, bartering with a crab, or just trying to figure out why your inventory is full of tainted fish, this game delivers on all fronts. Just remember, no matter how epic the quest, never trust a friend.",

Phenomenal story, it's theme is quite dark so don't expect a cute little adventure. Lots of different intricate stories depending what you discover in the game and who you play as. Quite hard and frustrating if you try to make your own build, and you can never \"fix\" it, as later progression will just wear you down even more. Just pick a build online and follow it, it'll make your life easier and there's so many online that you'll find what you wanted to play as anyways. \n\nGreat playing both solo or with friends. Combat, crafting and story are better than Baldurs Gate 3.\n10/10",

        "review": "I tried to like this game, but I'd barely gotten to Fort Joy (the first area of the game) before it became tedious.\n\nI'll start by saying the game has some strengths. The entire game is voice acted, which is nice. There're lots of NPCs to interact with, lots of quests to do, a class system complex enough for builders to work through. There is quite a bit of scope to plan your characters, and the option to play multiplayer is also nice (it is unique as well in all the RPGs I've played). It is highly nonlinear, and there are many ways to meet a quest objective. You can also kill (almost) any NPC, which completionists might find fun just to see how the plot reacts.\n\nHowever, the game is also plagued with problems:\n\n- The plot is very dry. I more or less lost track of it completely soon after arriving at Fort Joy. The game doesn't introduce what Source is, why Sourcerers are considered dangerous, what Fort Joy is, and so on (I actually learned this stuff from Wikipedia).\n- The characters are very dry. I came to know my party members OK, but almost everyone else just fades out of memory. For example in the first zone there's a blue dragon, but what their name is I don't remember, or why they were shackled when I first met them. They're completely colorless and leave no impression, and I barely interacted with them.\n- You do a lot of running around, but there's no fast travel beyond waypoints. After you've waypointed you still have to s-l-o-w-l-y walk to wherever you wanted to go (even worse if you split your party).\n- Inventory management is tedious. It's not immediately obvious which items are junk, which are equipment, or even which are armor pieces and which are weapons. There's no way to search for which items add to a particular stat. Furthermore the items have weight, so you can't lug everything around, and there's no way to search for the heaviest items so you can drop them.\n- Combat is also tedious. Even if you're level 8 and your opponents are level 2 - which means you kill them in 1 hit - you still have to go through the same turn-based combat, watching their animations.\n- You also repeat the same tactics against most opponents, adding to the tedium.\n- Even worse, combat is needlessly complex. I've lost count of the number of times I've friendly fired. Friendly fire in this game is not like casting a Fireball and having the edges of it hit my teammates, it's things like aiming the Fireball at an enemy and then having it hit my teammate because they were in the line of sight - there is no warning that this will happen. Similarly, I've stunned myself by casting lightning spells on something who's standing in a pool of water. I still haven't figured out if this always happens or if it's a percentage-based chance. Not having \"combat preview\" is an incredible drawback.\n- There's no difficulty scaling. This means the game is less nonlinear than one might think, because you might not have the levels to do stuff in a different order.\n- There's also a limited amount of enemies, which I suppose means there's no grind, but also means that, combined with the above, you should kill all the nonessential NPCs you can for loot and gold.\n\nThe upshot is this game has no plot, so there's no reason to play it for the story, and also tedious combat, so there's no reason to play it as an action game. Why play it then?\n\nYou're better off playing Dragon Age: Origin, Cyberpunk 2077, or The Witcher 3, to name a few other RPGs off the top of my head.",

Combat can be summarized by rushing to the high ground and stat dumping, and no real reason to play any class that wasn't damage mage or archer because of how bad they were, so got stale fast. Isometric games with no cutscenes is painfully outdated, also takes you out of immersion. All this leave no good qualities to come back to, 3/10",

        "review": "This is a huge game, with replay-ability. \nAn Astonishingly beautiful soundtrack.\nGreat Aesthetics.\nStellar writing and stories, well... most of the time.  \n\nIt's far from perfect though:\nThe combat felt worse than DOSDE1 due to the armor. In the first game you immediately started with an elemental combo, now everything is blocked by armor, so my mage character felt far less useful after summoning its minions. And combat definitely feels tedious even on classic difficulty, so I think I'd only recommend playing it in Story mode. Difficulty increase doesn't make the game harder, just slower. Actually I ended up lowering to story more halfway and I still felt that its a bit slow.\n\nToo many micro management stuff in the game:\n- Like going back and forth to a source fountain to refill, \n- Too many lootable containters that are empty and are a waste of your time.\n- Inventory management is a nightmare, and while the auto-sort in the character's inventory is nice, containers should have the same, and most importantly a 'store all crafring ingredients' button would be a welcome feature. 90% of my game-time is just dragging items in and out of the inventory. And I barely used most of them. But OCD be damned I can't help myself I had to check every container, because \"What if it has something important in it?\"\n\nToo many simultaneous quests, I hate it when games dump over 20 quests at me at the same time. Pacing developers, pacing!\n\nLots of bugs: \n- Ryker first addresses you as if you attacked him even if you didn't.\n- The entire Seed of Power questchain: Can't talk to Daeyena at the first encounter. Then at the second encounter if you have spores on you while she detonates the magister they will explode and she will get hit thus turning hostile. etc, etc.\n- And many more I am not gonna list. Luckily most of them are not game-breaking and minor inconveniences.\n\nSome A.I. Issues:\n\tCharacters will avoid damaging surfaces, but will step on every single trap on the floor, even if they themselves spotted them. Even worse, Sir lora who's not in your control, and moves periodically(even in turn based mode, he just goes off repeatedly, teleports back, runs away again), had commited self-delete for me many times by running on and off of traps repeatedly.\n\nStory (Spoilers)\n[spoiler]Some quests are quite nonsense. For example I played Sebille, and Saheila doesn't make any sense to me. If you refuse to take the Mother tree's place because you don't wanna be a slave again, she attacks you. Then she asks you to kill the mother tree because the mother tree enslaves people. And then she thanks you for freeing them and says she hopes to see you again, even though she's freakin blind. \n\tI think my biggest issue is that this game REALLY requires you to either be omniscient or to go to the wiki if you wanna have the best outcome for quests. For example, I encountered the Shadow prince before I went to the mother tree, and I ate his heart, only to realize that it was a quest item. Stuff like this happened a lot.\n[/spoiler]\n\nAll-in-all, my complaints are minor and this game is a prime example of how an RPG should be.",

        "review": "DOS 2 is easily one of the best RPGs I've played - ever. Great immersive gameplay and the graphics, audio, voice acting and storyline are just fantastic. It's also the only RPG I've played through more than once as the combat system is deeply intricate with so many combinations of skills. It deserves all the awards, seriously. \n\nIt's a great game no doubt - but nothing is perfect so here's some of the bad: \n-There's really no tutorial on the deep intricacies of game mechanics and which stats to stack or not to stack. It's about experimentation and trial and error. Reading forums and game sites are almost essential to understand the plethora of play styles and tactics. It's really easy to make a ton of mistakes that are show stopping on your first play through that may even require a game restart. \n\n-There are complete \"cheese\" tactics that break the game. Some cheese only works once off while other cheeses are ongoing and affect the entire game. I don't feel cheese tactics should exist in any game because it's like lawful cheating. \n\n-Knowing or not knowing the \"cheese\" tactics can snowball into whether the game is either really difficult, moderate or really easy. Technically some aren't cheese tactics but it's just how you optimise to the game. The game has certain mechanics and hard coded attributes that make skills and abilities rather unequal. Some skills are clearly trash in almost all situations where another unassuming skill can turn out to be the best thing since sliced bread. The game clearly pushes you to certain overall techniques of play and if you don't, the game really punishes you for it. \n\n-Inventory management can be a lot better. It's a bit tedious at best but not a deal breaker. \n\nThat said, the combat mechanics is one of the most intricate, immersive and combinatorial I've ever played despite certain biases the game pushes.",

        "review": "[h1] A Divine Fantasy RPG [/h1]\n\nDivinity sin 2 is a fantasy RPG with a rich story and a immersive world. I Wanted to play this game, because i ran out of things to do in BG3, which made me crave for more of that kind of an experience. I Had decent expectations, but oh BOY i was blown away by this game.\n\nYou start the game as a sourcerer (not sorcerer) being transported in a ship to a place called Fort Joy, which houses others like you who have been caught by the law for using source magic. After some events, the ship happens to be attacked and sinks to the bottom of the sea dragging you with it. To your luck though, you happen to survive and make it to Fort Joy where your journey begins!\n\nDepending on your character, you might have a completely different journey compared to another character created. The world is very reactive to your character, which means race, gender, history and reputation come into play in conversations and relationships and even fights. Your character matters in this game and makes it feel more authentic in the process\n\nThe combat is surprisingly similar to BG3's. The real difference of it is, that the game values staying still and possibly passing turns. In a vacuum it doen't sound that great, but in practise the feel of this combat is better than BG3's. Overall, the combat is very smooth, unique and a solid system that works fantastically.\n\nNow, the way the story is told is by dialogue that is voiced, though contrary to BG3, DOS2 has no cutscenes. This doesn't matter though, because as you experience the story you tend to fill in the gaps with your imagination, like with a book. This works in the games favour and makes it so good and great to experience/read/listen.\nThis was one of the core reasons for me that the game felt so smooth and complete. There was never a moment, where something regarding the action during a dialogue didn't make sense, because i tended to fill in those gaps by visualizing it.\nEverything was just meant to click in a way to make you feel something. I cannot explain with words, how good the story is. It is just something that has to be experienced, though not having cutscenes can absolutely be a minus, if you don't like that.\n\nOverall, the game is in my opinion is better than BG3. I Have not experienced anything like it in a long time. Last time i really experienced true immersion, amazing story and perfection was with World Of Warcraft, which really doesn't have that anymore, so i am glad to have one of these experiences once more.\n\nI Recommend this game 100%. If you have even a slight interest in fantasy RPG's or strategy games in general, this is your game.\n\n(PS sorry if my english is bad. Thanks for reading.)",

The characters you meet are great, the story and setting are great and the combat is great, while also being unforgivable. Every choice you make van either make or break your entire encounter. The synergies between spells/environment are great and can lead between some interesting strategy options. It's also super rewarding to see that side quests actually are worth it and that they (in some cases) influence some encounters. All in all this game is an absolute masterpiece worth of all the praise it gets. If you like bg3 you'll definitely love this game!",

Larian have proven they're the masters at creating unique and challenging combat encounters. Encounters where you simply have to defeat a few chumps are few and far between and Larian really lets you stretch your creative problem solving legs to get around obstacles. There are dozens of sub quests you'll be able to follow while progressing your main quest, and if you're not an RPG purist, you can make free use of a guide so you don't miss any, as well as a mirror in your hub where you can respec at your leisure as often as you'd like. A great quality of life when you're an indecisive gamer and you've found multiple sets of gear you want to try out. \n\nIf you're new to RPGs, I would also suggest using the Lone Wolf option, so you have fewer characters to keep track of. It's my preferred way to play this game.",

Character classes are adaptable and interesting and there are usually a few ways to do any particular problem.\r\nBUT If you want to play any of the higher level difficulties you'll need planning, class knowledge and to be saving a lot. I recommend playing on the easier levels for at least one playthrough; I'm a veteran of DOS, POE and BG but when I came back to play this on Tactition after finishing BG3 on honour mode? Ouch. It pulls no punches and you really need to know how to build the characters optimally if you're going to have a chance. It *is* a great game, but be prepared to crunch the stats and do a lot of googling to work out how to survive the higher level difficulties.",

        "review": "A sprawling RPG, which, as is typical, is more about the journey than the destination. The game delivers on a premise of freedom and player choice, with the first chapter (Fort Joy) the most successful. Here there is a great sense of detail, agency and being part of a much larger story. The second chapter is also very good, but the problems start to emerge. It’s quite easy to run into fights that cannot be won, which leads to the player creeping around the map and hovering over enemies to see if they can be tackled at the current level. The final chapter is a mixed bag of unfinished ideas, and features a number of poorly explained fights that have a specific but difficult to discern solution. \r\n\r\nIt’s abundantly clear that the game was meant to be longer but could not be finished. Eventually all is revealed and the game ends. The writing at a small scale is very good, delivered in very well executed voice-overs and as text. It’s only as you zoom out and consider how all the parts ultimately fit together that it becomes less satisfying. \r\n\r\nThe mechanics are good, and the combat is less dependent on RNG than most games of this type, though there are, of course, elements of this. The crafting is good but there is so much of it that it’s a bit overwhelming, and the player will likely settle on a few things and ignore the rest, while lugging around tons of junk. Equipment, too, suffers from the Mass Effect 1 problem of overabundance – very slight differences and trade-offs across an ever-increasing number of stats (the gift bag feature of upgrading kit seems like a good idea). \r\n\r\nOverall it’s a great game, but I hope that in Baldur’s Gate 3 Larian learned to properly scope the project so that the experience is consistent from start to finish.",

After beating that game multiple times and playing with hundreds of mods, I felt like I squeezed all I could out of it. I wanted something new. I had known about Divinity for a while, but not known anything about it. When the summer sale came around and the 1st & 2nd game were bundled for $15, I decided to check it out. \n\nAt the time of this review, I have just beaten Divinity 2; and honestly, I think I love this game more than Baldur's Gate 3. There's just so much charm and intrigue filling this world, the story never felt like it dragged to me, and the combat plays so differently to D&D, it was just refreshing to me as someone who knows the mechanics of D&D inside and out. I especially love the elves, they're so weird and pretty. \n\nThis game is absolutely worth your money, and personally I can't wait to sink hundreds of hours into this game as well.",

        "review": "I'm about half-way through the campaign and I've got to say, if you are like me and came to this older CRPG from Baldur's Gate 3, this game will feel very familiar. But in a good way. The game is extremely open-ended and flexible. You are only limited by your imagination and your skill set as to accomplish the various tasks set before you. You can use violence to solve your problems by fighting everyone. You can slick talk your way through sticky situations. Or you can just turn people into chickens. If you can dream it, you can probably do it.  \r\n\r\nLike BG3, you are dropped into a situation (you are arrested and taken to an island prison due to magic being suddenly made illegal) and from this starting point, it's all about the story you discover as you explore and interact with the world. You could get five different people to sit down and talk about their campaigns, and you would end up with five different stories.\r\n\r\nWhat is my story like? Well, it's shaping up to be about a cowardly petty criminal slowly turning into a hero  out to save the world from an acorn-related disaster with the help of a talking squirrel. And some stuff about being chosen to rescue the gods from a corrupting force that's turning magic into a source of evil. \r\n\r\nHere are the main differences between Divinity: Original Sin 2 and BG3:\r\n\r\n1. This might be a hot take but I much prefer DOS2's combat system. I found it much more intuitive since it was designed to be videogame-y rather than use the D&D rule book when I don't play table top RPGs. In DOS2, you get action points each turn that can you use for movement and attacks. Skills have a cooldown of a set number of turns  before they can be used again instead of a set number of uses between long rests. It's all very easy to understand so I was free to focus on tactics instead of worrying about dice rolls on things I barely understand. Best of all, it doesn't feel like attacks miss half the time. \r\n\r\n2. The companion characters are less of a focus. Like BG3, there are six origin characters that can serve as companions if you create a custom avatar. They are an interesting bunch, both well-written and well acted by the voice actors, and each one has a questline that spans the length of the game. However, interactions are really spartan when compared to BG3. There are only certain points in the game when they will comment on events and when you can converse with them and get more information on their backgrounds compared to the exhaustive interactions you could have in BG3. What's here is gold, but the DOS2 companions feel well... like videogame characters instead of people.\r\n\r\n3. It's less visually polished. To be expected since this game is close to a decade old. It's a still a good looking game to be sure but don't expect impeccably mo-capped character models or triple A quality cut-scenes. Everything stays within the birds-eye view of the isometric game world at all time so you aren't going to get close ups of the onscreen action. \r\n\r\nI seriously hope that the developers' next game can take the battle system of DOS2 and meld that with the visuals and character writting of BG3 to make a combination that's the best of both worlds.",

        "review": "Relative to the first game, which is to say when you consider the difference in technology, narrative and experience that Larian Studios had available at the time of both DOS 1 and DOS2, it is dramatically less impressive. However, DOS 2 is still a masterpiece in its own right. The only real faults with the game are evident only in relation to the first game and expectations of the game-play that one might have from the experience of DOS 1. DOS 2 is much longer than the first, but with much less finely tuned pacing that makes the game feel like a slog especially in certain sections. There are too many narrative arcs that feel like the exposition is just being thrown at you. Actual agency in terms of the way quests play out feels limited despite the game's implications otherwise. And finally, the combat -contrary to all of its bells and whistles - leaves a lot less room for tactical innovation over just having ideal skills and stats.\r\n\r\nOn it's own the game shines. It is a whopper of a story - even with all the parts in which it drags - and it presents a universe of characters as compelling as any Genre Fiction novel. Fights are extremely entertaining and do present many opportunities for meaningful and intentional exploitation of game mechanics. It may not be the most enthralling experience for a genuine RPG master, but it does give a lesser player the illusion of being one. It's much easier to put down and come back to later - without suffering RPG amnesia - than most in the genre and the story has many self-contained bits that feels rewarding as you trudge toward completion. \r\n\r\nPersonally, it's not the kind of RPG that has significant replayability but even without trying to 100% one can easily squeeze out 100-200 hours of playtime. I am extremely cheap when it comes to purchasing video games, but it is one that I think is absolutely worth the money.",

        "review": "Off the tail of [i][b]321 hours[/b] in Baldur’s Gate 3[/i], I decided to pick up the entire Divinity collection since the bundle was on sale for 60% off. As its immediate predecessor (in terms of Larian’s published works at least) it still manages to be worse in just about every way. \n\nI’ve sunk half a days worth of time into it at this point and feel like I’ve done hardly anything. The story feels sluggishly generic, practically beat for beat with games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire (as far as Act I anyway, since I [b]just[/b] got out of the main starting area) and is drip-fed outside of books scattered around. If you’ve ever played Skyrim, imagine you potentially didn’t get to use your Shouts [u]at all[/u] [i]before[/i] getting the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. That’s what I’m dealing with right now.\n\nSpeaking of books, while some give recipes or skills upon reading them, there’s no way to give the latter to any character except the one who read it, and no way to know which ones will grant anything beforehand.\n\nAutosaves are abysmal in their consistency so you get sent back an hour when you most need one, usually getting one right after you get back to where you were, and there’s no indication of when you should quicksave unless you have shift held down to see enemy sight cones. I finished a fight and thought I was safe after having just unlocked a waypoint, only to have my entire party killed in one hit before I could react.\n\nThere’s no way to confirm skill points being used prior to spending them; attack cones aren’t ever accurate in who or what they actually hit; characters sometimes can’t attack due to being unable to see if they stop in the same spot before a fight (most often when one is triggered right after you pass through an entranceway); and loot is totally randomized outside of Unique items so on top of not being able to get your loot back after dying prematurely following a fight, combat becomes less about tactics and more about putting all your points into your attack attributes and ganking one enemy at a time hoping the rest keep targeting your tank. Instead of being fun or exciting it just becomes a hindrance in these circumstances. This includes shops too.\n\nThere’s no setting to have your avatar automatically selected after a fight so you’ll end up speaking to a character that you’ve saved or otherwise as a random member of your party, which most often has the same dialogue lines aside from whatever tags your character has (i.e. Undead, Elf, Scholar, Jester, Noble), and you can’t view your companions attitudes towards you despite there being a tutorial explaining how to do so. \nThey never really interact with you after the prologue area anyway besides a quick line before a required fight or a quip to themself while walking. You can talk to them, sure, but they’re just combat vessels following you around otherwise. They’re characters that are written with potential, but having to go out of your way to see that except when you first meet them makes the party dynamic nonexistent for me, especially when most of your time with the game is going to be spent [i]in combat[/i] or traveling between fights.\n\nThere are also select community mods built-in that are available to you in the form of “Gift Bag Features” which don’t warn you that they disable achievements prior to enabling them. This is especially worrisome considering the majority are QOL enhancements, and from what I’ve heard some cause more difficulty than they seek to fix.\n\nIt has the humor of the other games but completely lacks their charm. I should note that I decided to skip the first D:OS after Beyond started refusing to let me launch it on my second day of playing no matter what I tried, making me have to restart my computer every time, and Divinity II felt disjointed and uninspired compared to the original 2 (yet I guess I didn’t exactly get a lot of experience with them either).\n\nIn a word, I wouldn’t even call D:OS2 [i]clunky[/i], it’s just [i][u]muddled[/u][/i].\nI’m very excited to see Larian’s abilities moving forward following the astounding Baldur’s Gate 3, but [i]this[/i]… isn’t in the same boat.",

As a talented musician and gifted performer, Lohse’s charm is immediately apparent. However, it is her inner struggle and resilience that truly define her as the best waifu.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of Lohse’s character is her battle with an internal demonic presence.

This blend of lightheartedness and depth makes her a multifaceted character who feels genuinely alive.\r\n\r\nIn terms of gameplay, Lohse is a versatile asset. Her abilities as an Enchanter allow her to heal and support the party, while also wielding powerful offensive spells. This versatility makes her invaluable in combat, reinforcing her role as a dependable and capable ally.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Lohse’s combination of a compelling backstory, engaging personality, and gameplay versatility make her the best waifu in Divinity: Original Sin 2.

        "review": "Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a top-down RPG and turn-based combat game.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- *Much* better than the original D:OS! This game is actually quite fun! It's like an early version of Baldur's Gate 3, set in a totally different world.\n- Has the concept of a limited set of Origin Characters to choose from as playable characters, which allows the game writers to better tie your character into the story. Each Origin Character has their own special quest and unique conversation options.\n- Epic plot that is full of surprises (if you don't mind that your major enemies always arrive everywhere before you do).\n- Combat is varied and detailed enough to keep it interesting.\n- Supports online multiplayer and local two-player coop via split-screen (this requires controllers)!\n\nTHE BAD:\n- When I was introduced to the characters at the beginning of the game, they all seemed to be awful people (they all proved to be sympathetic enough that they grew on me over the course of the story, though).\n- While the game is playable via controller, the controls are a bit awkward and the camera angles are never good.\n- You sometimes need to do fast precision clicking, but that's next to impossible with a controller. There is no option to go turn-based outside of combat.\n- Certain puzzles and parts of the game can be quite obscure and frustrating. It's nothing you can't solve with good old Web searching, but trying to read the designer's mind is never fun.\n- The plot is fairly linear.\n- I think the writers flubbed the ending a bit. The structure of the ending is in two parts: (1) a single choice you make at the very end, and (2) a mosaic of the consequences of all the little choices you made during the story. I usually find a mosaic ending to be best for story RPGs, but in this case all the mosaic consequences follow directly from the single choice you make at the very end. So at the end it doesn't feel like your little choices during the story actually amounted to much.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n- There were plenty of minor plot or conversation glitches, but nothing game-breaking or terrible.\n- We experienced a few crashes.\n- I hope you aren't afraid of the sight of blood.",

        "review": "Negative since it can be a very frustrating game. The way some things are structured you quite easily lose a few hours.\r\n\r\nRandom dialogue options/ characters = INSTA-DEATH (like i have to explore everything to gain enough XP. to add random insta death characters all over the place to make me lose a few hours is annoying.\r\n\r\nSometimes the dialogue options are all kinda bad or at least bland in the choices. Hard to choose anything if you have nothing you actually can agree with.\r\n\r\nThe accents really don't fit the game. Personally really disliked them. \r\n\r\nYou can randomly lose companions. sometimes permanently. Worst part is they will keep all the gear they had in the inventory. (SPOILER. when you enter the well of ascension. if you just walk through the door instead of talking to all your characters first you lose them?? sure they got the icon that there is dialogue but all game that hasnt meant anything important. you also lose companions through other fairly random events if your not hardcore trying to follow the story but even then you cant know the first time..)\r\n\r\nOne of the most frustrating things about this game. Some checkpoints overwrite your own saves.. Like im not joking. itll start a boss fight and overwrite your last quicksave. If its your first time playing it will very likely end your game right there.. or make you go back several hours (SPOILER you wake up some ancient witch.. and at the start of the fight it overwrites the save. fight starts with a big aoe and your surrounded by wolves so unless you played it before you will likely lose)\r\n\r\nThe whole concept of only being able to do certain quests in a certain order. it is annoying. i have to spend ages looking for a quest my level when ive already explored the map 3 times. not to mention there are several maps. it can take the fun out\r\n\r\nOverall you almost have to read guides in order to not meet any nasty surprises thanks to the bad design. It is fun and there is a lot of ways you can fight and all.. but a good game shouldn't be plagued by so many little problems. And looking at the company. and the game that came out afterwards (baldurs gate) and it being practically the same system.. so i really dont feel bad giving them a bad review. \r\n\r\nIt is a fun game (for the most part)  but maybe worthwhile to wait for a solid discount",

But its SOOOOO GOOOOOOD, seriously, the combat is deep and rewarding, the progression is great, caracters build can be very flexible, the history is awesome and the voice acting is very good, choices do matter, and Ive neves play a game so dense since DOS1, you see a map that look small but its SOOO pack with things to do. A lot of people will come check this after playing Baldurs gate 3, and if thats the case, the game is deeper and more flexible, but the production is a little smaller, no in engine cutscenes for dialogue and such, but the combat and buids are deeper and more flexible. It has become one of my favorite games ever. Lucian bless you guys for making such an awesome game.",

I also can't change it ingame to my actual profile with the select button/arrows like it says online. I cannot recommend this game unless you plan on playing it for 100+ hours without closing it and then not playing it again on the same save). Something similar happened in baldur's gate 3 and I hope larian gets rid of this absolute tomfoolery soon.\n\nEdit: It fixed itself.",

        "review": "*destroys magic armour*\r\n*cast dominate mind, mind maggot grenade, charm person, or madness*\r\n- me every moderately difficult fight\r\n\r\nI was told this was the best game to play after Baldur's Gate 3, and as I get to the end that was totally right. It fully feels like a stepping stone to get to BG3 and is also just fantastic to play. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Honestly having so many levels feels very satisfying even compared to BG3 where you only got 12\r\n-The fighting is just really fun. Took a second for me to get used to the small changes (like turn limits, source, and no resting needed for spells), but it was certainly well done and had so many possible moves/spells.\r\n- Characters are great (Sebillle ily), and a fun plot that I enjoying playing out\r\n- Voice acting is very good (Sebille VA ily)\r\n- There's so many options for armour that all have different ways to boost you, so many different designs, ability combinations, sets to match etc. (not being able to level it up is a little unfortunate, but I think it makes sense for the game so I wouldn't say that's a con)\r\n- Making your party specialize in different areas and have different abilities is so fun (which realtes heavily to the fighting, but in general it's just great)\r\n- the support abilities are so much better here than BG3 - partially because I didn't need to worry about wasting a spell slot, and because some only took 1 slot which would be all i was left with, but also they were just legitimately better\r\n\r\nDifferent than BG3 (not really pros or cons, just differences when comparing a relatively older game to a modern masterpiece):\r\n- The characters (side characters and main ones) don't have nearly as much depth in this game even though what we get from them is great\r\n- no cutscenes (again, these points aren't giving any negative points in my eyes, just stuff that could make it even better if it came out now)\r\n- Levelling up doesn't come with as much customization and changes\r\n- Aspects of the story (and side characters) are both a bit more convoluted and simple, as well as just harder to follow - still good\r\n- There's no long resting, and short resting (using bedroll) is only for restoring health. Honestly besides missing the camp that aspect was actually more convenient\r\n- Oh yeah there's no camp clothes, and costumization options due to no cutscenes, but there's also more armours and lacking informal clothes doesn't do anything\r\n- there's no dice rolling which I missed even though it was kinda nice that I didn't have to worry about rolling a 1 lol\r\n- Moving and actions are counted in the same 4 moves (the amount you can walk per move depends on character) which I can see being better or worse. I like both\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- The levelling system can be a little annoying and I ended up needing to look at level maps which I guess is elaborated on in my next point\r\n- The game doesn't feel like it guides you enough or gives you quite enough freedom (to be clear this is a grievance, but isn't nearly as bad as that makes it sound, just something I encountered a couple times). There were times I would accidentally stumble into enemies who were too high levelled, but they were already aggravated (or I couldn't talk my way out) so I would have to load before I met them and just avoid them until I could reach the correct level. There was also one major time that I didn't know I had to trigger events in a specific order (or a couple times I thought something would trigger another event so I avoided it only for it to not matter - like going on that kids boat in act 1) and what I needed to do wasn't really said which led to me kinda fucking up a part of the main story... Also led to me not getting resolution on Peeper and reloading continuously to save him for half of Arx only to realize he had no relevance after the arc he got introduced in and I had just not casted Spirit vision where I was supposed to\r\n- The persuasion (or I guess this applies to tags and just general interactions too) aspect can be annoying, maxing it for the main character is the move, but it can still be annoying just because occasionally your allies will be the ones to be spoken to, especially after battles if you aren't the closest one to the NPC. Then you have no persuasion and are lacking your tags which can lead to another issue. Also had to reload a couple times to bring my MC closest to the NPC before a fight ended or to intentionally trigger conversations that my allies accidentally did\r\n\r\nAnyway I'm sure there's many more things I could add (and I probably should've waited until I actually finished, I'm sure the end is great) especially to the pros, but if you enjoyed BG3 and see this review, yes it's a fantastic game to play after BG3. It's got no major issues, and is just great, if you're craving another game like BG3 (or just craving any game to put some hours into) this is the one",

        "review": "I am going to run out of superlatives for Larian developed games soon.\r\n\r\nSurely Baldur's Gate III will blow my mind.\r\n\r\nDoSII for those of you who have played the first original sin game this is very much a game which has added onto an already great formula in an excellent way. I really like the addition of the origin characters allowing you to play a roll within the game world. Less a go anywhere do anything kind of RPG more a play this character in an excellently fleshed out game world.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't played a Larian game yet DoSII might be the best place to start. However be warned the game does not hold your hand if you do not know the mechanics it can be a real struggle at the start. As I found in DoSI\r\n\r\nI will try to keep the review pretty spoiler free so here are my general thoughts\r\n\r\nPros\r\nYou can skip the loading splash screen (Larian know how to show me a good time)\r\nYou can exit to windows from the pause menu. (Larian really know how to show me a good time)\r\nSave anywhere. You can even scum save during combat. this is really great I am fed up with developers ruining single player games by trying to balance them. There should be zero balance in a single player game imnho. If you paid for the game you should be able to cheese it to your heart's content.\r\nTurn based combat. There is no frustrating RTS micro management in the game.\r\nThe range of skills is increased from the original game and this is a really good thing. There are so many combos and effects you can use. You can really keep the game fresh by varying your combat.\r\nThere is still many ways to cheese the game if you care to or if you are stuck on a tricky fight. I think this is a really important in single player games.\r\nExcellent well fleshed out characters with full voice acting.\r\nA compelling narrative and deep game world with some intriguing lore ripe for immersion.\r\nFixed level enemies mean some fights you cannot win without levelling up. This is great imo and makes all those side quests worth while.\r\n\r\nCons\r\nThe ending and final battle was pretty unremarkable. Which is I suppose is at least consistent with the first game. I got there and felt \"is that it?\". After nearly 100 hours of greatness this left me wanting a little more.\r\nAgain in keeping with the first game I felt the opportunities for \"Role Playing\" were limited. Maybe this is because I picked and origin character (Fane) and therefore felt a little railroaded into his story.\r\nThe game seemed pretty easy to me. I played on classic difficulty and maybe I had learned from original sin 1 about the usefulness of summons. But to me the game was much easier than the first title.\r\nThe music to my taste was standard bland fantasy RPG fare. It wasn't bad but often a superlative score can lift a game from merely average to stupendous. The DOSII score was not that.\r\nI barely used a potion in the entire game. I managed without buffs and mostly without healing which may be down to my difficulty choice but I did feel I was carrying around lots and lots of junk.\r\n\r\nOverall one of the best RPGs I have ever played. By no means perfect (what game is)  but still a long way ahead of the competition.\r\n\r\n9/10",

It's a bloated mess of disparate, clunky mechanics that is frustrating to navigate. Fights take ages due to ponderous animation. The combat system is pretty interesting but hard to appreciate when every action takes so long. It's really just frustrating and cumbersome to actually operate this game and it makes some really baffling design decisions that compound the issue, like the chaining system. I'm uninstalling at this point and probably won't finish because I am totally out of patience for this uninteresting slog. The scope is impressive but it fails to deliver an enjoyable game. There are much better CRPGs out there, with memorable stories and engaging gameplay, for less money and less disc space.",

It's very immersive! There's so many items to find everywhere, the music is great, and I'm enjoying the voice acting. There's so much attention to detail and the tutorial really helps to ease players into the game. I'm 69 years old and have never played turn based games like BG3 or DoS2  but I\"m happy to say you're never to old to learn something new and discover the joy of a new genre in gaming. I highly recommend this game to everyone who loves rpgs whether you're experienced with them of not. This one will take you on an adventure you'll remember for a long time.",

        "review": "I bought this game during steam sales, seeing good reviews i decided to give it a shot. \r\nAt first i wasn't convinced, but after a little time i started to really enjoy it. Now that i finished it, i can say without the shadow of a doubt that this has been one of the greatest games i've played for the past 20 years. And i play a LOT. Trully an amazing, immersive experience.\r\nThe story is great, the combat is great, the (many) little details are awesome, the build customization is great, going from character creation (with racial skills/passives) to choosing a specialization (mage, rogue etc), then a spec in the spec (fire mage ? earth mage ? necromancer ?...), then secondary spec etc, its re-playable thanks to this aspect of the game and the fact that you can ultimately change what happens in game with choices of dialogue leading to different endings.\r\nThe only thing i didn't quite enjoy as much for now is the crafting aspect and consumables (potions, grenades, scrolls), but its my fault since i'm kind of a meta dog, i tend to go with what seems like the most OP things. No doubt that you can actually make good use of it and actually do a run based on it.\r\nIn the same way, some passive talents can lead to interesting results if you dare to try them.\r\nFinally, i love the graphics and the animations, but i really have to take my hat off to the guy who did the soundtracks, while all of them are good and add to immersion, some of them are straight up masterclass.\r\n\r\nNothing i disliked really, except the fact maybe that sometimes you can \"accidentally\" kill someone and it can be an issue lore-wise or for completionists. Not game breaker in any way though, and easily avoidable with a quicksave.\r\nI've seen some people complaining about bugs, they might be fixed with definitive edition because in 300 hours i didn't get any.\r\n\r\nBasically if you like RPGs, don't even think about it, you have to try this game.",

        "review": "New to DND style games and decided to play this with a few friends. And as a new player to this genre of game, for new players, I say this is a skip. The game has a lot of fumbles with it. You would think that when playing a DND type game that you are going to create your own character, class, etc and you can do that. But you are only going to get away with that if you play on the most basic difficulty because the enemies are weak and as a first time player you are not going to know where to allocate your points into what stats.\r\n\r\nSo me and my friends played on the standard normal difficulty and things led to many things that break the so called immersion of this game. Save scumming because we did not like certain quests ending the way they did, dying because the enemies take away your armor in one hit, not positioning properly for a fight you didn't even know was about to break out and get AOE to death, and persuasion checks that are pointless if you succeed them, you're still going to fight. So that adventure got canned and never finished.\r\n\r\nSo then I did a solo run, still can't play the way I want to, so I default to what everyone does, look up builds. Now I am not playing a game the way I want to play, I am playing just to beat it and the builds work. Now we go even deeper issues with this game. Enemies, your class skills need to be properly tuned and fixed with a patch. I don't care how old this game is, enemies being blocked by a house door or being behind furniture or something in the house and they have line of sight to attack me, but then I try to shoot them with my ranger no line of sight. Enemies clipping terrain, now you can't crowd control and knock them down to negate some damage. For the people that like to be immersed in these type of games, how can you be when 90% of the NPC's are rude as **** forcing you to become not the hero but just someone that gets things done with so much blood on your hands. NPC's you helped in the past act like they've never seen you or saw you help them in the past and sometimes see you have something of their's \"Give it to me! Or your life.\" You want another example. \"You helped me and I've given you my thanks, now p*** off.\" That doesn't seem like immersion to me, that just makes everything in the game look like XP numbers to me now.",

This game expands upon almost all aspects of the first game for the better. But at the time of writing this review I only have around 26 hrs of game time and that is because the story just doesn't really grab me. The story is much better than the first game as I cant even remember anything from that games story aside from a wizard who can turn into a cat. I probably just become more critical in regards to story as the years went by. I always found the writing to be stronger in the Pillars of Eternity series so that sucked me in much more than this game. \n\nI still recommend this game because its very well polished, the voice acting and animations are great and the elemental gimmicks in combat are still great fun. I might come back to finish this game someday so who knows?\n\n",

        "review": "The difference between BG3 and D:OS2 can be explained pretty easily if you've ever looked at all the stuff that 5e has done to make D&D more simple and accessible-- all of that makes for a worse video game. D:OS2 is dense in systems, but it takes the time to teach them to you and by the time you get going, you really feel like a god of some sort. Combat is never about chipping away health, every turn has important decisions that can be made that affect how the combat rolls out, with enough dynamism to allow both you and the enemy to bounce back into contention from the brink of death at almost any point in the fight. Also, the music is better.\r\n\r\nThe quest writing and characters of BG3 are certainly more mature and more polished, but OS2 feels like I am sitting down with a bunch of friends back when I was a kid to make up a story on the spot. BG3 is the best version of 5e D&D as it actually exists, but OS2 is the game you thought you were playing when you first learned what Dungeons and Dragons was. Both are good, but damn I love OS2.",

I love the story and engaging world. Especially in act 1 with the feeling of, watch out with what you do as this place has consequences. It always felt just like BG3 where if you think it, it's very very likely you can do it. \n\nCombat is a mix for me. It has been both a blast, harsh, annoying and yet at times I felt like I was cheating by using the mechanics and combos as intended. \n\nI only intended to play once due to how long a single play though takes. Though now I will likely play again... very soon.",

Melt it and then use lightning to shock enemies when they enter the puddle left behind!)\n\nThe story and companions are not on the same level as BG3 in my opinion, but the exploration is of the same high quality.\nI highly recommend this game (and its predeccesor for that matter).",

        "review": "For me it is not a CRPG. It is much more a quest/puzzle game. Unfortunately there are enormous amount of situations where you just try solve a puzzle like in 90th. Looking through very inconvenient small interface for very small point to click. A lot of battles implies new rules. It is not a question of studying moves of enemies but new rules constantly. It is not fair from gamepoint. You can may ideal moves throughout the game and constantly face situation where some mechanics do not work, some new condition appears and you loose. Just because you must do something absolutely different after reload. And it is not logic and using tips. Just new rules for new battle. \r\nIt is still a RPG which is my favorite genre, and there are a lot of very good ideas. But for me Larian just has not managed to cope with those realisation (and I doubt the someone would succeed with them). There just too many thing that do not work properly. If compare with Pillars of Eternity 2 this game much more bold and sometimes can bring you joy and satisfaction (and even more than in POE2) but at the same time half of the game is just pain and dissapointment with a lot of negative emotions.\r\n\r\nANother dissapointment is the presence of the \"golden route\" to approach each act. SO de jure it is semi-open world, but de-facto you must approach each act in linear way to minimize negative feelings (like spending 2 hours to win a boss battle being significantly underleveled to receive no reward at all or being unable to proceed further because you have not acquired some story ability yet). \r\n\r\nAnd the last point - you do not believe in this world as there are too many simplifications and gamedesign elements which are not properly explained. At the beginning of the game magisters are low level enemies with low heals and armour, with the same magisters are megatanks in the end. No. I do not believe in this! In other games enemies are more dangerous with increased levels but here they just have more healts and armour. And your damage is just bigger. No. It is a bullshit from the story and lore perspective.\r\n\r\nPlay BG1-2, POE 1-2 (no Pathfinder - it disrespects your time much more), if you want CRPG.",

        "review": "I tried very hard to like this game and got all the way through Act 1, but it never really clicked for me. The way the dialogue is written for your character is unlike many other RPGs I've played, written in 2nd person in such a way that you only get the broad strokes of what your character is saying.\n\nPlaying an Origin character, the Red Prince, had mixed results for me. I picked him because the general consensus is custom characters feel a bit lacking in comparison. But it was plainly obvious I was playing him far nicer than the writers intended him to be, because every one of his unique dialogue options ran contrary to how I intended to play him. I think this level of choice could actually be a detriment, i'd rather Larian have done something closer to Deus Ex where the Origin characters at least had more spoken dialogue and didn't give you 4 dialogue options every time for a response, where most of those result in the sameish reply from the NPCs. It's just fluff at that point. BG3 has this issue too but to a lesser extent.\n\nThe gameplay was... too messy. Larian struggles to make a UI that doesn't feel user-hostile and messy as hell to use. BG3 after this managed to get to what I consider passable - DOS2's is just not enjoyable to interact with and requires constant micromanaging to keep usable, and that's time spent away from interacting with the core gameplay and the story. DOS2's turn-based combat feels slow and clunky compared to similar games, and the surface system would have benefitted immensely from using a grid. Animations are slow and lack weight, prepare to hear \"I'll yield to none!\" quite a bit, and be forced to often choose between moving and attacking since they draw from the same resource of action points. \n\nThe leveling system is a bit too freeform for my tastes. There's no classes per se, simply tons of skills you can choose form an level up in, but to me it is nice to have the structure of a class but the option to branch into others via multiclassing or the like. This felt like utter choice paralysis for me as the game doesn't do a particularly great job easing you into its mechanics either. At some point it started feeling like I needed to pull up the wiki and build guides just to operate at a base level.\n\nGear progression is tied to the merchant's randomized inventories and did NOT feel like it kept up with enemy levels unless you were grinding out every single quest in an area, which didn't feel good. By the time I reached the end of Act 1, the challenge felt reasonable for the Act boss, but as soon as Act 2 began I felt miles behind the level curve once again and put down the game because I wasn't down to spend more than 28 hours in Act 1 again. \n\nIt's a shame though because I was enjoying the story, as grim and dark as it was from the outset. The art style is nice, though the presentation is extremely basic when it comes to dialogue unfortunately. I was interested in the world Larian had crafted and the Lizards, as lazily named as they are, were my favorite race playing as the Red Prince. \n\nI gave it a good shot but this game isn't for me, it just never clicked, but there's something good here that you might be able to enjoy better than me depending on your tastes. The game also is free of nickle-and-dimeing predatory microtransactions, so I'd sooner recommend it than a lot of triple-A titles right now.",

Over 1000 since 1986. \r\n\r\nBoth Divinity I and II are better than Balder's Gate 3 and I put 440+ hours into that.  \r\n\r\nThe Only let-down in DOS2 is the lack of crafting, it had the system and all the bits in place but doesn't get utilised like it does in DSO1 - but this game is extraordinary fun, and has an amazing set of features.  I won't spoil it for you but I cannot recommend this game enough. Besides being truly beautiful, imaginative, tactical terrain, a rich variety of enemies and friends, excellent dialogue (inc very funny parts) the Shops/Traders stay meaningful - even when groaning with gold you can always find something worth splurging on; < this is SUCH a rarity in most RPG games. The acting and voice-overs are top-notch. The combat system is wonderful fun with a staggering variety of options for play styles, though it can be punishing with the wrong team or wrong skills, you can get opportunities to re-skill at any point through the definitive extras. The game rewards you for hunting high and low and looking in random places - a beautiful trait for the born explorer that makes you want to search every corner. The range of quests are exceptional, never boring, the music, visuals, and optional game settings are so nice and the creativity in the landscapes is so enjoyable to explore. There are puzzles, tricky bits but a robust online help community if you get stuck. This game offers so many ways to play inc. all kinds of boosts and checkboxes so it doesn't drag you down trying to complete sections with the wrong characters, and lets you change up. This allows you to be more leisurely and OP if you want to be and just smash your way through the map, valuing your time.  I've only just arrived in Act 3 - and I already wish there was a divinity III (or IV) or DLC, or just more, more, more of it. Just excellent - bravo Larian!",

So much depth and so many possibilities in this game. Most quests feel like they can be solved in many different ways. Each combat encounter is amazing, though it might get kind of boring and repetitive after some hours. However, that encourages you to experiment and discover even more possibilities!\n\nVery much recommend. Now Baldur's Gate 3 awaits!",

I find the early game on the standard difficulty to be a bit ~too~ easy- so i cranked it up to Tactician and whoo boy what a challenge. It was fun to experiment with strats like positioning casters at high ground to make use of the huntsman stat and various other neat mechanics. Only \"complaint\" is that the source abilities feel a bit ~too~ limited in early game, but end game makes certain spells feel like a must have because of how much power is locked behind their use- but overall one of my all-time favorite games! A fantastic rpg experience from the creators of BG3!!",

I'd recommend doing research into the game (specifically combat) if interested in buying.",

        "review": "After playing Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3), I decided to explore the Divinity series, starting with Divinity: Original Sin 2 (DOS2). Content-wise, DOS2 is significantly larger than both Divinity: Original Sin (DOS1) and BG3.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n-Content Size: DOS2 offers an expansive world and more content compared to its predecessor, DOS1, and BG3.\n-Improvements: Many of the critiques I had for DOS2 have been addressed and improved upon in BG3.\n\nCRITIQUES:\n- Companion Interactions: I started my playthrough on Tactician mode. In BG3 and DOS1, companions often comment on battles, adding a lively and immersive element to the game. However, this interactive dialogue is almost absent in DOS2, which diminishes the sense of companionship and immersion.\n- Storytelling: The storytelling in DOS2 is primarily conveyed through text. While the narrative is still good, it doesn't quite compare to BG3, which utilizes animations to enhance the storytelling experience.\n\nOVERALL, while DOS2 is an EXCELLENT game with a lot to offer, especially in terms of content, it falls short in certain areas where BG3 excels, particularly in companion interactions and animated storytelling.",

        "review": "Before i even start talking about the game, here's a little tip that could save some players a headache. If you experience frequent crashes and have the Razer Synapse installed, unlink the game in the software parameters. It completely fixed the issue for me.\n\nSo, after playing to and loving BG3, i've become curious of Larian's previous works. I've heard people saying that BG3 should have been called DOS3 and i can perfectly understand their point, because they have A LOT in common. In both games, you start as a prisoner on a ship that crashes and are saved by a mysterious voice. There are a lot of little examples like this where the two stories are quite close. Some BG3 companions are directly inspired, or a mix from two DOS2 companions (i see Astarion as a mix between Sebille and the Red Prince).\n\nBut the resemblance doesn't stop there. Both games have no real huge travels between maps, they include 3 or 4 big zones absolutely packed with content, the last one being a city. So yeah, they're pretty alike (excepted BG3 has of course a lot more bells and whistles, like cinematic scenes for more or less every NPC encounter, there are none here). That hasn't been a problem for me as i found both games to be excellent, but at times i felt like they haven't been  very subtle in the way  they copied stuff from DOS2 to make BG3.\n\nThis being said, DOS2 might be inferior from a technical perspective but there are some aspects of the game that are better. DOS2 is tougher. I played both in tactician difficulty and i found DOS to be much more of a challenge. I'm now at the beginning of the final act and there have been times where i wondered if i would be able to go on  (you can't lower difficulty after picking tactician), because some fights are really tough and requires that you make the best use of the topography and of your skills. Not saying that BG3 is an easy game, but winning in DOS felt more rewarding to me.\n\nThere are also a ton of items. It seriously felt like i was playing a looter shooter at times. This is due to the fact that  there is a skill that gives you a chance from getting a magical item from basically any container in the game. Even better, a part of the loot is random. It adds an element of surprise and i prefer that to fixed loot tables. You can really finetune your gear to make exactly the character you want.\n\nIf you're looking for something to play after BG3, DOS2 can definitely scratch that itch, if a more modest technical presentation isn't an issue for you. If you can get it for 12 or 13 bucks during a sale like i did, it's a complete steal.",

BUT I am so so glad I didn't DOS2 is probably in my top 3 of best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. This was a jam-packed adventure of great stories, sharp twists and turns in the plot, and super interesting mechanics. I easily put 100 hours into my first play-through of the game and I don't regret a second of it. \r\n\r\nPRO's \r\n- Deep story telling, and inter-connecting quests\r\n- Deep character ability customization (want to be an electrifying fire wizard who summons monsters?)\r\n- The variety and amount of different options you have for any situation you encounter is fantastic\r\n- Endless hours of playtime per play-through, there is so much you can do!\r\n\r\nCON's\r\n-The game is a little wonky sometimes with what it allows you to do and where\r\n- Combat for the first probably 15 hours of the game feels like you are a deer in the headlights\r\n- Quest locations are a little iffy, you get a general \"area\" to look in rather than exact locations. (Points of Interest)\r\n- If you don't use thievery on at least one character you are nerfing yourself in my opinion \r\n\r\nOverall I can't say I made the wrong decision buying this game over Baldurs Gate 3. Larion Studios I salute you, love you, and hope you make more Divinity games as I can't recommend this one enough :D\r\n\r\nEND THOUGHTS/TLDR- ||BUY THIS GAME|| if you like CRPGS",

        "review": "I have \"played\" this game for hours now, and while the visuals and story are pretty incredible, I would not recommend based on two factors: The lack of ability to configure WASD character movement for keyboard, and the lack of interactive tutorials.  \r\nI find the native point-and-click movement really uncomfortable.  It feels like I have less mobility than I should. I know that there exists an option to use a PC controller, but I prefer not to, as most (if not all of my) PC games support WASD movement so I see no reason to use a controller for just this one game.  I tried to get used to it but found myself taking a break from the game and coming back, then habitually trying to use WASD and getting annoyed that it does not work.\r\nThe in-game \"tutorial\" is just an instruction manual and not really a tutorial at all.  For instance, there was a tutorial page that simply says something to the effect of: add all skill points to your tabs to become stronger! That's it? Really? I had to sift through all of the many menus to figure out what tabs this is referring to. Before I knew it, I was thrust into combat, not knowing a thing about how the combat system works.  I would have preferred a more interactive combat trainer that shows me how to use my abilities, how to move, and little nuanced things that a non-DnD player like me should know (such as how drinking a potion when my character is undead actually deals damage somehow?)\r\nOverall the game seems to be great quality, and based on the other reviews I've read it has some incredible content.  However, I do not like that I'm more than 4 hours into the game and still have no idea how to play it. I'm tired of investing time trying to learn the game and find whatever appeal that other reviewers found.  So far I've just been asking myself \"When does this get fun?\" I'm glad others enjoy it, but this game is definitely not for me.",

I ended up not finishing it; I really enjoy tactician mode but there was a point in the progression where it didn't seem like there was anything I was remotely powerful enough to pursue and I fell off. Might finish one day though, it's a great experience.",

И шрифты, боже мой, шрифты! Не хочу спойлерить, но я, кажется, знаю, как ослепла Сахейла — она просто читала каждый документ, каждую записку, каждый том сомнительных искусств и каждое описание необычной склянки или куска папируса с рунами. Потрясающе, что нужно редактировать конфиг, чтобы тебя не постигла та же участь, в настройках же игры такие опции пилить слишком мэинстримно, понимаю. В остальном же — затягивает, это да.",

So it usually boils down to: Knowledge-check -> die horribly-> reload previous save -> repeat\r\nThis is partly due to the encounters having a fixed level, meaning you can stumble into an ambush that is three levels above you with people directly spawning into the backline of your team. It also doesnt help that a lot of story encounters are scripted so that certain enemies always go first.\r\nAll in all this lead to a mostly frustrating gameplay experience on my end, and had me sit in safety and wait for others to trigger combat in the last act.\r\nOn top of all of that, there were a bunch of bugs and glitches further draining my patience and causing a bunch of additional reloads. \r\nAnyone who wants to play it alone or with just one other friend and does not mind loading safes a lot might get their fair share of fun out of this.\r\nFor me it was 50% frustration 30% whining over bugs and the finicky controlls and camera angle 20% actual enjoyment of the game.\r\n\r\nBut that is just my experience, you do you ;D",

The combat system is easy enough to manage; just make sure that you're constantly doing side quests for bonus XP. Otherwise, the game is much harder. I only have one game with more playtime than this one, and that's because it's so amazing. There are a few bits that are clunky, though. For example: in Fort Joy, to progress further you need either a shovel or a character who is a lizard. Finding a lizard is easy enough: the Red Prince. However, if you've already assembled your party, or you don't want to recruit the Red Prince, that means you have to find a shovel, and there aren't many of those around. I had to look up where to find one.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this game is better than not. I'd recommend it to anyone who has played games like the Baldur's Gate series, or any other topdown RPG. It's just beautiful. Also, the computer has a weird glitch: I have played 64 hours at the time I'm posting this. IDK why it shows 24.",

I have to pick builds for my NPCs, but I have absolutely no idea what I'm picking.\nWriting - I do not care at all about any of the characters I have met, which makes picking their classes that more obnoxious.\nExploration - I found some shells. Maybe if I skip enough of this dialogue, I can also find a more interesting map.\n\nI had some pretty high hopes for this game back when I bought it, but I have been consistently disappointed with my purchase. Oh well, YMMV.",

        "review": "It's a good RPG game with a lot of focus on tactical turn based combat. It's RPG system is unique. It has it's own classes with their own strengths and abilities, you can even specialize in multiple classes and make your own. The enemies are challenging, especially on tactician, forcing you to think through every turn and plan for every encounter. The environment is very interactable during battles and plays a huge role on you'll be fighting. The combat system is one of it's biggest strength.\r\n\r\nThe only complain I'd have is that enemies in tactician are so difficult that normally you can't win without cheesing the combat to some degree. This breaks the immersion a bit and makes you feel like you've been cheating the entire time. Although one could argue that it's not cheesing and it's just tactical decision making using the game's systems. Personally, it mostly feels like cheesing.\r\n\r\nThe story and quest is alright, nothing too deep. Mainly just heroes trying to save the world from some evil force or calamity.\r\n\r\nIt's a really good game. It's just not for me personally. I think depending on tastes, some people will like it and others will find it boring. At the time of writing this review, I played it on tactician difficulty and got bored and stopped after getting to Arx which is about 60-70% through the game. I could however see myself returning to the game in the future maybe on classic difficulty.\r\n\r\nI'm still gonna give it a positive review because it deserves it.",

I think it has even better approach to character RPG creation, better fighting with enemies, and great story. Yes, it does not have all \"movies\" and epic \"cut-scenes\", but its storyline is amazing. So, try DOS-2, like i did. Good luck with start, as it is quite challenging. And enjoy a lot of surprises. Loose fights, to come back, and fight them again, when you stronger. All the best!)))",

Story is fine, pulling off combos feels good - but the game feels unfair in ways the first game didn't.\r\n\r\nLook online for help and lots of responses talk about sneaking around and utilizing teleport to gain unfair advantages during fights. Bosses never play by the same rules you do - able to jump right into back line while starting with maximum AP and having it restored every round. \r\n\r\nLots of fights seem far too prolonged - such as the Aeterea fight who gets unlimited summons of her dogs. Additionally, there are many ambush fights that kick off with little warning. [spoiler]For example, Red prince sleeping with his love interest results in an ambush[/spoiler]. Having played other CRPGs like BG2, Pillars of Eternity, and DoS1, I never felt the game was as unfair as DoS2. [spoiler]Except for encountering lich the first time in BG2[/spoiler]",

Could very well have been down to a skill issue as I did a lot of research on character builds near the end of my play through and ended up having to adjust all of my characters and get a lot more skills and put different weaponry on every character. With that being said, every big fight seemed nearly impossible to win from the start of the game. The game should be difficult but I felt it was impossible to kill all of the enemies without doing cheese strats like leading enemies into NPCs that will help but like I said I guess I didn't have great builds for my characters. \n\nI would like to get all of the achievements but I don't think I will be able to beat this game in honour mode at all. I saved the game like every 2 minutes.\n\nOverall, a very great game with lots of game-play mechanics that allow for creativity and lots of play-styles. Even though I'm not a creative person myself, researching the game allowed me to see videos where people are doing the most crazy stuff to kill enemies. The number of skills that cab be used and the amount of skills that I've never seen in any other game surprises me and I expect to see that uniqueness in Baldurs Gate 3.",

        "review": "Short version: A very detailed and well-done Tactical RPG that has oodles of replay value.\r\nPros\r\n+Massive character customization : 4 Races and an Undead version of each one, class-less build style (archers and melee fighters can all wield \"magic\" if you invest skill points to an Element)\r\n+Story line with impactful decisions : people you meet and interact with in Act 1 can make appearances or mentions in Act 4\r\n+Adjustable difficulty that adapts : Enemies don't just get increased stats as you climb in difficulty. Some get additional buffs or auras that completely flip the script of a fight.\r\n+Turn-based combat\r\n+Music is pretty decent\r\nCons\r\n-Humour can be hit-or-miss : Some of the story leans into a light-hearted side that just doesn't work sometimes. And item tooltips are also very punny.\r\n-Some fights can feel completely overwhelming or \"cheesy\" (enemies stun-locking you with water and electricity, for example)\r\n-While replay value is very high due to multiple characters with backstories to explore, the very beginning feels bogged down or sluggish on a 2nd + playthrough (imo before you get a \"jump\" skill)\r\nUncertain / Opinion\r\n-No \"New Game +\" : All the consumables and items you find on one playthrough are lost on a new game. There is no bringing stuff from the previous runthrough into a new game. This promotes a \"smoke em if you got em\" style of play, but I'm more of a hoarder nature.\r\nConclusion: 100% recommend - the sheer customization available and replay value of this game is staggering, and well worth the price.",

I usually don't write steam reviews, but this game deserves it.\r\n\r\nOne of my all time favorite RGPs, have over 300 hours on GOG over several playthroughs, bought the Steam version for better modding.\r\n\r\nJust finished a full modded playthrough, although the core of the game always stays the same.\r\nit's truly a great and heartfelt story, about saving the world and facing good and evil.\r\nWith many hard and mature moral choices.\r\nWith great humor and great drama.\r\nWith emotional stories of the people you encounter in the game and with amazing world building.\r\nThe RPG systems, the combat system, itemisation, the tactics, are as well greatly enjoyable and fulfilling, giving you a sense of accumulating power and rewarding you for smart moves.",

Just buy it. \r\n\r\nI've sunk a lot of hours into this game in a short amount of time (Steam says 18, it's really more like 80 - the counter reset several times) and it's seriously excellent. Just the prologue took me over 12 hours and I didn't even attempt a completionist run. Even so, it didn't feel like 12 hours as the story sucked me in HARD.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons I've played D:OS II so much is the Deck. It runs fantastically on the deck, and controller support is excellent, unlike it's younger sibling BG III whose nested wheels drove me mad and relegated the game to a mouse and keyboard. The scheme is simple and works well with a controller, so much so that most of my time in this game have been via a docked steamdeck with an xbox Elite 2 controller. It's flawless. \r\n\r\nThis game can be a real challenge, forcing you to embrace the boundless depths of RPG customization to best suit your play style. Quick saves are a life saver (pun intended) as approaching an encounter even a little bit wrong or unprepared can end in sudden disaster. Use them, and use them well. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint about this title is the RNG feels a bit unbalanced at times, but perhaps that's just me. \r\n\r\nOverall, 10/10 will play for MANY more hours.",

Very, very fun.\n\n\nFUCK I'm glad it is over, though.\n\n\nThis game, in comparison to BG3, is much more brutal in its difficulty, with a story that is (in my opinion) better stitched together. Definitely worth playing.\n\nOkay short review done, I'm going to take a nap now.",
