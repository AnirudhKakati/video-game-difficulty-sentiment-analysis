Over time, you'll develop favorite strategies, understand the cards better, and gain a feel for the rhythm of this game in a way that just feels good. And sometimes you just find buckwild combos that make you feel like a god. Aaaand then you go to the next ascension level, get your ass handed to you, and begin to learn how to play a little better all over again. Balatro is probably the more approachable game for newcomers, but after that, everyone should play Slay the Spire.",

Every play through is different, and choices really matter.\nI have been playing on the steam deck and its  very smooth experience.\nA tip for new players, you dont need to add every card you are offered, sometimes a smaller deck can be faster and more effective.\n9/10 i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys laid back strategy games.",

It’s the game that shifted my focus away from big AAA titles, leading me to discover smaller, yet deeply rewarding experiences. A must-play for any fan of strategic games, and I’m thrilled to know a sequel is on the horizon!",

        "review": "Let me tell you, Slay the Spire is one of those games that feels like a chaotic, card-flinging whirlwind at first. You’ll dive in, gleefully throwing random attacks, eating curses for breakfast, and wondering why the elite just turned you into a squishy pancake in two turns. But here’s the thing: the more you play, the more you realize – this game is way less about luck and way more about skill.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, Slay the Spire is a masterclass in combos and synergies. Sure, you might pick up a seemingly random hand of cards at first, but once you start connecting the dots, it’s like solving a puzzle where each piece gives you a new power boost. Get the right relics, nail the perfect card synergy, and suddenly, you’re a juggernaut of destruction, making bosses look like confused kittens.\r\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the randomness – it’s what keeps things interesting! Each run is different, and while luck can sometimes throw you a curveball, true Spire-slayers know how to adapt, turning even the most cursed hands into epic victories. The randomness isn't frustrating – it's exciting! Every run is like shaking a magic 8-ball that could either tell you you're about to destroy everything... or that you're about to get destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this game is how it tricks you. It starts out feeling chaotic, but the more you play, the more you realize it’s a perfectly balanced dance of risk and reward. And the deeper you go, the more the \"luck\" turns into skill, knowledge, and—let’s be real—just pure card-flipping satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSo, if you're ready to flex your brain while occasionally cursing the RNG gods, and absolutely dominating the spire with your killer combos, this is the game for you. Happy slaying!",

Infinitely replayable, challenging but rarely impossible, great to play both casually with one quick run after a long day and seriously by grinding for ascension ranks, 4 unique and varied characters plus an active workshop to keep the game fresh. All that is within a responsive and snappy UI, the visual design may be a little lacking in some areas but the art direction is clear and low key very charming. If you like card games this will be the best purchase you will ever make.",

I can't recommend this game enough, perfect for one and done players like me (beat the game once on all four characters), and even better for players who want to sink hundreds of hours into a high skill ceiling game. This is a game that will take you 5-30 hours to beat per character, and 500+ hours to reach the highest difficulties. It would be hard for me to find another game where the strategic elements are this well thought-out, it's truly impressive.",

Runs are reasonably short (especially when you are dying at the start) so you will have an idea if you like it or not before the refund period is over.",

        "review": "I enjoy the puzzle of working out how to beat the current enemy with your current deck plus the puzzle of what cards to take in order to strengthen your deck so you can beat future enemies. The interactions between cards and the hope (and randomness) of getting offered the right card makes each playthrough feel different. Plus the game is very well balanced so defeat or victory always feel like options. Additionally the variety of interactions makes each playthrough slightly unique, there are still combinations I have not seen or played despite playing for almost 2k hours.\nIn short, it's the best in class. If you enjoy this kind of game, don't hesitate. If you aren't sure, don't hesitate either. It's a cheap game :)",

Great variety in builds. I enjoy deck-builders because you can't guarantee what build you'll have every time so it's fun to be forced to think about what cards you want to make your build work!\n2. Mods! If you get bored, there's a decent modding community that brings a whole new light to the game\n3. Challenge. I'm obsessed with getting all the achievements because they present an exciting difficulty that I can brag to my friends about. \n\nCons:\n1. Sound and music is repetitive. Not really that big of a deal, but I hope they put more effort into the sound design of the sequel.\n2. Art style. I think the art style isn't everyone's favorite. Really minor stuff.\n\nObviously I'm reaching on the cons here. If you like this type of game, I'm not sure why you wouldn't enjoy it. Otherwise, if you don't enjoy it, It's probably not because of the game itself, but your personal preference.",

The point is to keep playing and playing so you can unlock new cards for upcoming battles in new spires. I like that aspect so you have plenty of build room but need to have really good strategy in newer runs.",

The goal is to build the best deck synergy to get to the end (because the enemies get harder). There are four characters/deck types to play, and it's random what cards you get, so you may end up with a run you know is not going to win and have to quit. But it's strangely fun despite that frustration. The game pulls no punches with difficulty--you can't win every go-round. But you still want to try again like a gambler.",

        "review": "It's the first game to do the rogue-like deck-builder and after 7 years it still remains the best rogue-like deck-builder out there.\n\nThe game is very deep and the possible card/relic synergies are endless. After hundreds of runs I have had countless runs where the power and play-style of the deck was entirely unique compared to the rest.\n\nThe best feeling is when you're barely keeping up with the difficulty curve in a run, and suddenly the deck magically comes together, card synergies just emerge out of nowhere, and you identify your win condition.  \n\nThe game rewards creativity and pivoting - you cannot force a certain archetype. But every run is winnable if you are intelligent about how you build given the resources offered.\n\nI highly recommend to anyone who's played a rogue-like and enjoyed it. And the mobile version of the game is fantastic, despite what you may have read elsewhere. It's exactly the same just with different UI. So investing time in this game comes with the plus of being able to enjoy it on mobile as well. (And StS2 is coming soon!).\n\n[h3] Difficulty [/h3]\nThere are 20 difficulties to progress through once you win a run. So if you want to climb up the difficulties the game continuously gets very hard. There is a high skill ceiling but the added difficulty at the higher levels do not feel unfair or overly punishing. Completing the highest difficulty will take time, which is a good thing IMO. I'm at 15+ out of 20 on all 4 characters.\n\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\nThe game is exceptionally smooth to play, and all of the UI actions feel great. There is good QoL like \"fast\" mode where all animations and delays are reduced in time (it does not feel unnatural, it's done intelligently).\n\nEach character is very different from each other and each has tons of possible deck archetypes available which play differently. There is a great amount of cards and relics, and the vast majority of deck themes have enough support available to be viable and flexible.\n\nIf you like feeling overpowered with a stupidly powerful or cheesy deck (like infinites and OTKs), those decks are possible and entirely viable but still not imbalanced (you can't force synergies, only identify them when available).\n\nThe graphics are divisive, and for me they are nothing special, kinda wonky. I enjoy the silly lore and world-building. \n\nLastly, if you're like me and don't care for playing-card games due to their prohibitive expenses, grinding, and PvP frustration, this serves as a much better card game fix that is reasonably priced, PvE, and feels fair.",

        "review": "After playing it on my Nintendo Switch, Slay the Spire quickly became one of my favorite games. It wasn’t long before I picked it up on Steam as well, mainly because I wanted to go after all the achievements—and let’s be honest, some of them will be pretty challenging. But that’s part of the fun, right?\n\nI’ve already won with Ironclad and The Defect, and now I’m working on The Silent (even though I managed to beat the game with them first on my Switch). Out of all the characters, The Silent has to be my favorite. There’s something so satisfying about stacking poison and shiv attacks. The ticking poison damage combined with the no-cost shivs creates this amazing feeling of control in battle—especially when you get the right deck build going. And that’s the double-edged sword of Slay the Spire: waiting for that perfect card to complete your deck can be both exhilarating and frustrating. Sometimes, it just never comes, but hey, that’s all part of the fun.\n\nI tend to avoid elites or mini-bosses because, well, they’ve killed me more times than I can count. Sure, I’m not the best at this game, but that doesn’t stop me from trying to get better and score a win. Even with all the losses, each run feels like a fresh challenge, and that’s what keeps me coming back. Plus, I’m really looking forward to the second Slay the Spire game. Hopefully, I can finish all the achievements in the first game before it comes out.\n\nI’ve also been experimenting with The Watcher, the fourth character, though I haven’t quite cracked their deck yet. The Watcher’s playstyle is way different from the others, requiring me to switch up my approach entirely. I’ll need to treat this character very differently from the rest, but I’m excited to explore how their stance mechanics work once I get a better handle on them.\n\nOh, and something else I’m curious about is the lore. Slay the Spire seems to have these snippets of story or background scattered throughout, and I need to dive deeper into that sometime.\n\nIn the end, Slay the Spire is an addictive, challenging, and strategic experience that deck-building fans shouldn’t miss. Even when the game is against you, there’s always that sense of ‘just one more run’—and it’s so worth it.",

Rogue Legacy at least put a theme into it, despite the fact I still did not like it in rogue legacy. For all the good in this game I just feel at a loss with it due to how much it expects me to play it lacking what is obviously some of the more crucial cards and combos.",

        "review": "I'm going to write this as a review, but also as a very broad new player guide, as I believe that understanding what it takes to be good at the game will help you understand why the game is good. Don't worry, i'm not going to ruin the fun of figuring the game out for yourself, I'm just going to go over the general thought processes this game encourages to show you why the game is so beloved.\n\nSTS is a roguelike deckbuilder. Roguelikes are random, and card games are random, so the game must be random^2, right? As random as these two genres are, the randomness of each of these components is heavily limited in many ways. The map generation follows certain rules and regulations, the enemy variety at each stage of the game is limited, and the card pool for each character is modest. Despite the seeming lack of variety, the game is full of interesting decisions because so much of the game is foreseeable. As you get familiar with the game, you'll find yourself being able to evaluate the strength of different cards with increasing accuracy as your understanding of the challenges in front of you deepens. If the game had 9 billion different enemies and cards, your choices would feel so much more meaningless and shallow. However, since the game was designed with restraint and predictability, as soon as you're offered your first choice of cards on the first floor, you'll often find yourself deciding between a card that is immediately strong, or a card that might be clunky now but could really pay off later. The card's you are offered are random, but you're always evaluating them against a predictable set of challenges.\n\nA common piece of advice I see for new players is that they shouldn't think about building a certain archetype of deck, they should be thinking about picking cards that give them the tools they need to deal with the challenges in front of them. I'm bringing this up because its very easy to go into this game with the wrong mindset, which will ultimately be detrimental and frustrating for you. In order to be successful in slay the spire, you will have to stretch the definition of synergy with your card selections and come up with a swiss army knife of a deck that can meet the demands of any situation. You can't just pick all of the shiv spam cards that obviously work well together. If you do that, then the enemy that punishes you for spamming shivs will kill your run. Of course, a lot of people would like it if you could just pick the obvious synergy package and win every run, but those people would get bored of the game after a few runs because the card evaluation process would be as braindead as looking for cards that have keywords your deck already has. STS often encourages you to pick a card that might not fit perfectly with the rest of your deck because you need a solution for a tough enemy coming up. For example, one time I had a defect deck that was based entirely around his orb mechanic, but I knew that I had no way to scale them up to finish off a boss with a massive health pool, so I took a single copy of claw, a completely non-orb related card that gets stronger every time you play it during a fight, and relied solely on that to get my way through the boss. This wasn't a rare card, its a common and not even a particularly good one, but It did something the rest my deck didn't. Another great example of this sort of thing happening is when a top player named baalorlord picked clash, and everyone was like \"wtf, why would you do that? Clash sucks ass!\" baalorlord went on to win the run and set a world record for most wins in a row. If he did not pick that shitty card, there's a very good chance he would have died. For the record, clash is pretty garbage.\n\nNow that I've explained why i like the game so much, I need to be fair and say its not completely perfect. Getting through the first few floors can be kinda boring sometimes, there are a few regular enemies that are a little too punishing (fuck gremlin gang, snake plant, and the avocado guy), act 2 in general has a bit of a difficulty spike that could be tuned down whereas act 3 can often feel too easy as a final act, and a lot of the events that give you a curse in return for something good are rarely ever worth it because curses are just so horrible. That being said, those issues are fairly minor and the game is still one of my favorites of all time.\n\nI hope this review was helpful and gave you some insight into why this game is loved by so many people.",

        "review": "It took me a really long time to decide to buy this game. \r\n\r\nI would often read the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but I really did not dig the artstyle at all. Furthermore, for some reason I was not really into the idea of a roguelike deckbuilder, I don't know why...\r\nAnyway, one day the game was on discount and I had some extra credit on my steam account, so I decided to buy it.\r\n\r\nBoy, was I wrong! This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. It took me ~7 years to play this masterpiece! I just beat act iv on all characters and I am now starting the Ascension mode of the game. \r\nI cannot recommend this game enough! The gameplay is exactly what I love in a game: easy to learn but hard to master. Additionally, the gameplay loop is addictive making you to want to finish your run, no matter if you win or loose. \r\n\r\nLike in every roguelike, RNG is a major part of the game. Nevertheless, the mobs and bosses are almost never impossible to beat, they are completely fair. One only looses if they make questionable decisions in their card rotations, relics, paths etc... This does not mean that the player has to follow a specific/narrow path to victory. There are a plethora of ways/builds in which you can beat the game.  \r\n\r\nI recommend this game to everyone, no matter if you like deckbuilders or not. This game is a steal even at full price!\r\n\r\nExtra reasons why I love this game:\r\n1) Lot's of community mods for infinite replayability.\r\n2) Works flawlessly on Linux/Steam Deck\r\n3) Slay the Spire 2 will use the free and open-source game engine, Godot. \r\n4) I now actually love the artstyle",

        "review": "Respect to this game for basically starting a meta, and it's a well-made game for sure, but it's too damn hard. I don't care if a legion of fans are going to make fun of me for this, I don't care about \"just change your strategy bro\" type comments, this game is punishing to a fault.\n\nI understand, it's a roguelike, you're not supposed to be able to beat it immediately. I like roguelikes. It took me many tries to beat Hades for the first time, for example. I also like deckbuilders. This game should really have been a favourite of mine but the runs are much too long to get to the third boss and just get absolutely destroyed. Everything in this game is designed to give you false hope. It feels like no matter how strategically I play, no matter which cards I take or ignore, no matter how cracked and OP my current build is compared to most of my previous ones, I will lose at the third boss every time (if I even make it there, often a harder enemy takes me out in the third area). Plus, there's very little meta progress, it's not like I'm unlocking 10% damage boosts or extra lives as I continue to lose, I just keep playing and losing.\n\nI've only managed to beat it once as the red guy but I prefer the playstyle of the green character and the blue one is cool too but DAMN this game hates the player.\n\nJust make it 10% easier, or better yet, forget this game and go play Spellrogue. They basically stole this whole game but made it a little more interesting and, yes, about 10% easier (it's hard AF too but it feels a little more fair than this), plus it looks nicer.",

        "review": "Slay the Spire is a pioneer of deckbuilder roguelikes. Maybe not the first to do it, but possibly the most critically acclaimed and well-known. It's created many genre mainstays like the Enemy/Elite/Shop/Chest/Boss map design. And it holds up extremely well compared to similarly aged peers like The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth and Enter the Gungeon. I just didn't like it. It is incredibly fun to [strike]backseat[/strike] watch, and I believe it's overall pretty well made, but there's many strange kinks its spiritual successors have hammered out, and I just didn't overall vibe with the playstyle it demands.\n[h2] Pros [/h2]\n[list]\n    [*][url=https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/Is-Every-Seed-Winnable/]There is a mathematically unwinnable win.[/url] And yet, no one's actually found it. There's been pretty close to unwinnable seeds, but even those have been beaten. By all means (unless you've made a one of a kind discovery), a loss is purely a skill issue.\n    [*]Synergy building is fun. It's always a good time doing 200 damage with a Heavy Blade, racking up 10x more Poison than the enemy has health, or beating combat by just mashing End Turn as Defect.\n    [*]The art design is wonderful. I thoroughly enjoy the painted visual style and orchestral music.\n    [*]Custom Mode gives you a TON of customization options for how a run can play out, particularly if you just want a pure power fantasy. Though, it's segregated from the main intended progression of hiking up the mountain of difficulty. \n[/list]\n[h2] Toss-Ups [/h2]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Every[/b] action you take matters. It's pretty easy to trace a failed run to one bad turn, one card choice early in the run, or one purchase you didn't make. Many Relics amp this up to a degree I find tedious. Items like Pen Nib doubling the damage of every 10th Attack, or Incense Burner making you invincible every 6 turns. These effects carry between encounters. Many of my runs have been lost to Incense Burner being the \"wrong number\". \n    [*]Slay the Spire heavily rewards slow play. The more you think on every action you take, the better odds you have of being successful, particularly due to the previous bullet point. Roguelikes typically have a given run time of around 60 minutes. Spire runs can easily drag on to 2 hours 30 minutes. Playing quickly AND well is a very difficult skill to learn.\n    [*]There's a default run difficulty, and then 20 Ascension levels after you must clear to \"beat\" the game. There are four playable characters, and Ascensions are tracked individually. Clearing everything on the 300 hour mark is feasible, but it may appear tedious to some, particularly if you much prefer one character's playstyle to another.\n[*]Slay the Spire is very difficult. And many community truisms and \"guides\" are outright detrimental to learning. Most of my playtime was hampered by bad \"advice\" that was very difficult to unlearn.\n [*]The playstyles of a high power and low power run are miles apart. I bought this game after watching cool busted crazy flashy runs. What I was met with was a lot of getting garbage cards my first three fights, walking up to the first Elite, and then dying due to lack of damage. On the one hand, you can get a bunch of busted cards and items early, and brainlessly romp through the Spire in about 40 minutes (also known as playing Watcher). On the other hand, you can struggle every turn you play, get mostly mediocre power boosts, take the harshest Boss Relics because you have no choice, and barely scrape by after almost 3 hours (also known as playing Silent). And the higher the Ascension level, the more likely it is to be the latter. Definitely caught me by surprise. [/list]\n[h2] Cons [/h2]\n[list]\n    [*]Watcher shouldn't exist. Everything else in the game is centered around the three of Ironclad, Silent, and Defect. The Fighter, Thief, and Magician. The three of them represent Attacks, Skills, and Powers, and Red, Green, and Blue respectively.  You can see this trinity of design in the cards they get, relics they get, and even items such as the three Keys. Watcher not only breaks this trinity, she breaks the game. Her typical \"Stance Dance\" rotation generates the highest damage and highest energy efficiency of every character while also generating large amounts of block at the same time. 90% of her fights end in one or two turns. Cards such as Tantrum, Talk to the Hand, and Mental Fortress make the supposed glass cannon zero risk, all reward. She sticks out like an overpowered modded OC.\n    [*] The starting decks are terrible and uninteresting. Every character starts with 4 basic Strikes and 4 Defends. The Ironclad gets an extra Strike. The Silent gets an extra Strike and Defend. This puts them at a disadvantage, since the objective of every run is to remove as many Strikes and Defends as possible because they're just not worth the energy cost. There's a Boss Relic called Pandora's Box that replaces all Strikes and Defends with random cards. It is purely beneficial in almost every scenario. There's an event that upgrades all your Strikes and Defends for free, and you still want to remove them first thing. Curse cards are skipped not because of their downside, but because it means you have to remove a Curse next and not a Strike or Defend. One of the most powerful items is the Peace Pipe, which lets you remove a card (Strike or Defend) at each campsite. Other deckbuilders solve this by making their basic cards upgrade into far more useful, synergistic things, or simply not having crappy starter decks.\n[*] Boss Relic design sucks. You gain 3 energy a turn, and spend energy to play cards. Most cards cost 1, but they can cost 0-5, or all your held energy (X). Not having 4 energy, or at least a lot of other \"Gain energy when X\" Relics + a lot of low cost, high output cards, puts you at a MASSIVE disadvantage. Thus, when you defeat the bosses of Act 1 and Act 2, you're offered to take 1 of 3 selected Boss Relics. They're typically \"Gain 1 more Energy per turn, but X\". Such as Runic Dome's downside of \"You can no longer see enemy Intents.\" Note that there is an enemy who's intent randomly changes each time it is damaged. Or Busted Crown's \"On Card Reward screens, you have 2 fewer cards to choose from (the baseline is 3).\" You can guess how fun those are. Once, as my first boss reward, I was offered the choice between Runic Dome, Busted Crown, and Ectoplasm (Gain 1 Energy at the start of each turn. You can no longer gain Gold.) I just quit the run right there. The purely beneficial ones (Tiny House, most character specific Boss Relics that aren't Watcher's) are usually just terrible or also exceedingly niche. Or you can just play Watcher, and easily go infinite with just 3 energy.\n[*]The design of a lot of enemies is exceedingly annoying. I find that many are designed particularly around punishing The Silent's playstyle. The Malleable ability makes enemies gain block each time they take damage. The Silent particularly trends towards doing lots of small hits, so this penalizes her much more than The Ironclad's few big hits, The Defect's purely passive damage, and The Watcher's lots of big hits. Thorns is the same thing, but you take damage when you damage the enemy. One of the most infamous Elites is Gremlin Nob, an enemy who deals more damage every time you play a Skill Card. Guess which character is the most Skill focused. In general, every single enemy will either flee, or infinitely scale up in damage dealt to encourage killing enemies quickly, and discourage mostly blocking and slowly chipping away at the enemy, or at least stalling that simply blocks too little. You would not believe what The Silent's playstyle is based around.\n[/list]\n\nI nonetheless recommend Slay the Spire to anyone who [i]does[/i] want a slow, highly thought focused strategic experience (Watcher is excluded from this). I just lack the patience for it.",

Welcome to the world of deck-building roguelikes.[/h1]\n\nIt’s not because the game keeps updating or changing; in fact, it’s stayed mostly the same over time. You can come back after months or even years and get that same core experience. But maybe this time, you’ll try a new strategy. With multiple characters, each having unique abilities and deck archetypes, there’s always something fresh to explore. While every card is playable, there are definitely good and bad ones, and depending on which bosses you face, one archetype might outperform another—but you only get limited information on your enemies.\n\nThe challenge comes from limited resources: is a card good for your deck? Should you upgrade, remove, or duplicate cards? Do you take a powerful artifact at the cost of your health, or skip it? There’s no right or wrong answer—you make the call, and as the run goes on, your decisions become more crucial.\n\nThe game is balanced, thoughtful, and endlessly intriguing, but what really keeps you hooked is the desire to improve. It may take some time to complete your first run and find a build that works for you. But then? You’ll want more. You’ll crave higher difficulties, more refined decks, bigger risks for bigger rewards. You might even start overkilling bosses and speedrunning. There’s always entertainment and challenge waiting, every time you replay it.\n\nThis game is the villain origin story of my roguelike obsession, and it remains my all-time favorite in my Steam library.\n\nStarting out can be tough, especially for those new to the genre. Winning will take time and effort, but once the game’s addictive pull sets in, you’ll have an incredible time.\n\nI recommend it to anyone, whether you're a newcomer looking for a challenging introduction to roguelikes and deck-building, or a veteran who hasn’t yet embraced this masterpiece—it’s worth every minute of your time.",

The game always surprises me how much fun it is when I play again, and it really draws me into the gameplay. The game can seem intimidating to start, and winning is HARD but making the stakes high somehow makes it even more fun to play! I also play the board game, and having the scoring, calculating and housekeeping handled by the video game also helps smooth out the gameplay and pulls me deeper into the story.",

In a separate bowl, add flour and salt and mix by hand to combine. Pour your water mixture into your flour and mix by hand until you get a rough dough, then transfer to a work surface and knead until it starts to pull away from the work surface and is relatively smooth.\r\nPlace your dough in a greased bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 - 2 hours at room temperature or until double in size.\r\nPunch down your dough and dive into 300g pieces. Form those pieces into balls and place them in a floured proofing pizza box, cover with a lid, and proof at room temperature for 3 - 4 hours. (If you do not have a proofing pizza box, you can use a floured baking sheet, cover it with an inverted baking sheet and wrap it in plastic wrap.)\r\nAmerican Pizza Sauce and Toppings:\r\nIn a medium sauce pot, add butter and olive oil. Set that over medium-high heat; once the butter melts add garlic, cook until fragrant, add pepper flakes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic begins to brown on the edges.\r\nAdd crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and a splotch of olive oil, boil over medium-high, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally or until thickened and viscous—season with salt to taste and let it cool down.\r\nAssembly.- Place one of your pizza doughs onto a floured pizza peel, and flour your dough generously.\r\nPunch your dough down in the center, working your way out to create a ¼” wide. Pick up your dough, place it over your closed fists, and rotate it around, gently stretching to 13” to 14”.\r\nPlace a couple of spoons of your sauce, starting in the center, spreading in little circles, and working your way to the edge until it gets evenly spread out.\r\nIn a medium-size mixing bowl, place mozzarella cheese, Monterey Jack, and Parmigiano; mix until combined. Sprinkle your cheese mixture to your desire and place in the oven onto your baking steel and bake for 5 - 7 minutes or until the edge gets golden brown and the cheese melts.\r\nEnjoy.",

You can already see this from the download numbers.\r\n\r\nFor a card game, it's actually quite a difficult game, though I'm writing this because I think card games should be easy. Because these are a bit of relaxation games, so my goal is actually to relax a bit. In this game, you have to constantly concentrate. So it's actually a way of playing the game that has an atmosphere that constantly challenges your intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable game. Addictive.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts on the second game: You should definitely have made all the game visuals in 3D and it could have been ultra-realistic. Because if we consider that even someone who has played for 100 hours still can't fully finish the game in terms of game dynamics, you don't have a deficiency there. It would be amazing if the second game turned into a visual feast. I'm saying this because I saw a game with the same graphics quality in the trailers you released. Still, thank you for your effort.",

Like If you wanna go a specific build like shieldbash ironclad, you are at the mercy of clearing tons of rooms to try and collect the necessary cards, and sometimes u just can't get the correct cards even after many runs which makes it very eh to play. But if you are just trying to win and not fight against the rng for a specific combo deck then the game in my opinion is actually pretty balanced.",

Slay the Spire is mechanically pretty simple if you're used to deckbuilding. It does not have many unique characters, bosses, or areas. However, the game makes up for it in it's depth. A level of depth I've seen few roguelikes in general match up to.\n\nEvery deck type, every enemy encounter, every card new addition; they all present interesting decision points for the player that keep the game interesting long after you've seen it all. I can't begin to imagine how difficult it was to make so many different moving parts of the course of a run fit in together, but they managed it somehow. I have over 200 hours between multiple devices in Slay the Spire and yet I'm only knee deep with how far this game can go. If you've not played a roguelike deckbuilder before, I can't think of a better place to start.",

If you like card games like yu-gi-oh, this is probably for you. You build a deck during each run going from node to node either battling, shopping or resting and upgrading cards. Each character has their own card pool but they can sometimes be mixed if you pick up a certain relic during the run. The skill comes in which cards to pick up and learning the best synergies for battle. If you beat the spire you unlock the next difficulty (ascension level). I'm 50 hours in now and I'm up to Ascension level 4 with Ironclad, barely touched the other characters yet. Picked it up on sale but would have paid full price years ago had I known how good it is.",

        "review": "I'm kinda guilty of judging this game by it's cover. At first it didn't seemed visually appealing. But thanks to the overwhelmingly positive reviews, i ended up considering to buy it. And now, after finishing the basic power level and some of the very first ascensions with the ironclad, i think i owe this game a good review. Beceuse i ended up likeing it very much.\nThe overall vibe was like playing the munchkin card game. You kick in the door, ready to fight the most random monster you can imagine.\nI realy liked the single player challanges/game modes in hearthstone and i found this similarly (if not more) engageing and fun.\nI realy enjoy the deck building part. A lot of fun synergies hides, ready to be explored. You have quite a lot of freedom, in shaping the deck. And your decisions actually matter. This game has some depths and isn't just a hollow shell.",

        "review": "Played this game years ago for 30 minutes, decided it was boring and ugly. Years later I stumbled upon a youtube video showing how to build your deck around which cards and relics you find first, how to plan your strat around enemies' AI, which made me give it a second chance.\n\nTurns out this game is awesome. Each character has mechanics that you can build around that each feel like a completely different game when you play them. It's like each character is a new hearthstone expansion.\n\nAfter playing this game for 30 hours on my friend Jack Sparrow, from the high seas' account, decided to buy it.",

If you like to build decks that can go on forever in magic and get you a bunch of \"blockers\" or free \"attackers\" then this game has it. If you like the item system in Risk of Rain and everything has either a positive buff or negative debuff (or MOST times even both), this game has definitely has that too. Are you just looking for something to consume HUNDREDS of hours of your life just because you're bored? Well guess what, that is EASILY possible in this game as well. Even though this game isn't even a full gigabyte, there is plenty of things to do in this game to keep you entertained. Every run generates a random seed with multiple random chances for encounters, events, card rewards, potion rewards, and shop encounters, while still having a set path with guaranteed fights and loot as well as chances to regain health or upgrade a card in your deck. With each seed being different, you will never have the same run through on any run in this game, especially with there being multiple ways to build your decks. Maybe you want to specialize in gaining block and doing damage equal to the amount of block you have. Maybe you like to deal damage by exhausting (exiling for you folks who play MTG) cards. Maybe you want to deal poison damage or even build a deck to ALWAYS have lethal on an enemy. There are a seemingly endless amount of possibilities in this game to make each and every run unique and interesting (especially since there is an item you can receive that will allow you to gain cards from other characters, which there are 4 of). Once you beat the act 3 boss on any character, you will unlock an ascension level for that character. Ascension is basically new game + but there are 20 levels total each doing different things (that also stack onto each other the further you go) to further make the game difficult if you are looking for challenge. All in all, there's just so much to do in this game and i have well over the 134 hours on steam (at the time of this review) in this game because i also have it on my phone, and i still haven't gotten past ascension 6 on either device. This game, for as small as it is, just has so much to do in it and a never ending cycle of fun no matter how much time you put into it. So if you are thinking of buying the game, don't even wait for it to go on sale if you can afford it, because it is worth every penny spent. It is a 10/10 game and i have zero regrets putting in so much time into it.",

My chimp brain got it's dopamine and told me \"good jub uggo, you did it\".\r\nYears later in an edible-induced stupor, scrolling through my steam library for dopamine like a crack addict searching for quarters in the couch cushions, I decided to boot up Slay the Spire one more time.\r\nIt has been roughly 90 days, I've reached ascension 14 on defect, 11 on ironclad, 7 on the watcher... I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. Who could have put such a game down right when it was getting started? the real game is the ascensions. The climb. The need to truly slay the spire at it's maximum power.\r\nOne day I will prevail, and then I will know... I've done good jub.",

        "review": "[h1] Just when I thought I was out.. [/h1]\r\n...they pull me back in! \r\n\r\nWow, Slay the Spire (StS) is an amazing deck-builder in itself but the mod-community for this game is something else. There are hundreds of hours worth of expansions (Downfall Expansion is SO GOOD) which makes the game replayability go from ‘yeah no worries, I can play this game for years’ to ‘they will find me playing Slay the Spire until the casket closes’. \r\n\r\n[h3] The way it just.. clicks[/h3]\r\n\r\nYou know what I love about a good deckbuilder? That after some playing sessions you get the feeling your skills rise but the difficulty rises with it. StS does this as well, giving you a look into the games different ‘heroes’ and unlocking some additional cards and relics before ramping up the difficulty. It makes the game easy to learn, hard to master. \r\n\r\nAfter some sessions you know which cards to look out for and sometimes when to not pick up any cards when presented with a battle reward screen. Less is more, because more cards mean a tougher time to really get your deck to ‘click’. And boy, when it clicks, it feels amazing. I like ‘The Silent’ a lot, a poison based more defensive hero. When you get the amount of poison added per turn and defence just right, you can tackle any enemy, no matter how tough. Thing is, to get it to that point takes time, skill, knowing what cards to choose and which to ignore altogether. \r\n\r\n[h3] Art style, sound, visuals [/h3]\r\nStS shines in its UI simplicity, cards are presented in the bottom centre of your screen (like most deckbuilders have I suppose). Each card has it’s own name, icon and description. What makes StS so accessible is that you don’t have to learn each of the modifiers by heart. When hovering over a card, a status, a hero/enemy you are presented this nice overview about what every stat means (and there are a TON). \r\n\r\nThe art style feels almost like a painting, it’s basic but beautiful. Animations are great without overdoing it. When I used to play Magic: The Gathering this was the style I’d always imagine it looking when playing a deckbuilder. Background are amazing as well which each of them fitting to the situation you’re in (fight, merchant, et cetera). \r\n\r\nThe overall sound is great, although I would have liked a more diverse soundtrack. Its not that the music gets repetitive easily but when fights go on for a longer time I sometimes notice it. Take this with a grain of salt though, I have played this game many hundreds of hours on PS already before buying it on Steam. \r\n\r\n[h3] But the downside, tell me about them![/h3]\r\n\r\nYeah okay, this is the part where I start writing about some of the stuff I’m missing. Here it comes.\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nThere is this occasional feeling that a run feels doomed from the start, but what do you expect? There is some RNG involved in deckbuilders, there’s nothing you can do about it. Good thing is, you start noticing it earlier and earlier as you play more games. The trade-off for not getting some of the cards to make your deck ‘click’ is by going for another run and having the most amazing deck ever. \r\n\r\nThere are so many times that I just say out loud: “Amazing”. Because StS makes you feel like it gives you all these tiny pieces to complete the most (in later stages) difficult puzzle ever made. But then you lay down the outer edges, you grab another card/relic, it fits, all of a sudden you went from surviving to destroying everything. The credits roll and you feel this huge feeling of having accomplished something special. \r\n\r\nAmazing.",

        "review": "This game is marketed as \"combining deckbuilders and roguelikes\", so, as a huge fan of both deckbuilders and roguelikes, I was very interested in trying this game.\n\nHowever, this is actually just a deckbuilder with no roguelike elements! It appears that this game is called roguelike because of adapting the event system from FTL, however that event system was a Rogue-unlike innovation of that game -- roguelikes usually have spatial consistency which is much more interesting strategically.\n\nIt is great that Slay the Spire has inspired hundreds of game developers to create more solitaire deckbuilders, and other \"Spire-likes\". These games tend to have \"roguelike deckbuilder\" tag, despite being even less roguelike, and sometimes not deckbuilders. This misleading marketing made the landscape worse (by hiding actual roguelikes which are great games) and thus is a reason to leave a negative review.\n\nI have played quite a lot of Slay the Spire, and it was fun, but then, moved back to Dominion (the game which started the deckbuilder genre) and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (the best roguelike). I would recommend all Slay the Spire fans to play these games. (Dominion is best to play at dominion.games for free, and DCSS is a free game!) \n\nAlso play Dream Quest, the game which actually coined the \"roguelike deckbuilder\" term -- and is somehow much less popular. I would not call it a roguelike (it is more like Desktop Dungeons: there is no spatial consistency, the map is a bit like in a roguelike but the monsters do not move on it), but it is an honest combination.\n",

        "review": "I played a little of Slay the Spire a little while ago, enough to beat it with the main characters, and then I dropped it. Recently I've picked it back up to grind out ascension levels and I realized this game is digital crack. It's insane how different each run can play out, even as the same character. There is so much variety in how you get to build out your deck, and each run has a very satisfying sense of progression to it. StS perfectly straddles the line between giving the player enough choice to make meaningful decisions without giving them too much freedom to become completely overpowered. \r\n\r\nThe ascension system is a genius difficulty setting. Each ascension level introduces a new difficulty modifier at a gradual enough pace to feel challenging without being overwhelming. These modifiers may be small and iterative but they have a tremendous impact on how you go about playing the game and making decisions, especially as they begin to stack on top of each other. \r\n\r\nWhile each run can feel unique, many of the enemy encounters are very predictable. This is actually a huge positive for StS, as it lets you plan out your deck to combat potential encounters for each floor. You never know exactly what enemies you will run into, but as you play the game more and more, you will have a better idea of what to expect. Even if I lose a run to an enemy I felt unprepared to fight, it rarely feels like the game's fault because of this.\r\n\r\nWhile the graphics and animations are plain, and the music can get repetitive, that hardly matters. The act of playing StS itself is very satisyfing, especially on the fast mode. This game almost has a hypnotic effect, kind of like the Tetris effect for me. It's the only game I've ever played where I will get lost in it and then realize I've been playing until 3am.",

I've tried all the big ones and dropped them within a few hours every time. But somehow I racked up 350 in this one. It's probably partially due to the fact that I grew up with trading card games like MTG and still play them a lot to this day, but it's also because the game is near perfect in almost everything it does. I could not recommend this enough to literally anyone who enjoys video games or card games in general. Even the higher ascensions aren't completely miserable (though I'll probably be staying away from A20 now that I've 100%d the game). It's all the satisfaction of beating a Dark Souls boss with none of the tedium.",

You can adjust around certain metas depending on the cards and relics you are able to get, and like Tavern Rumble on Android, this can result in anything from a run where you do high damage to a run where you have a bunch of poison and/or debuffs to play around with. The mods allow you to play as bosses, play as cute anime girls, and add various kinds of content and replayability to the game. 100% would recommend giving this a go.",

Did the same this time.\nBeat the game with the first character in 1 run, no issue.\nWith the 2nd character (who feels weaker in every way), died to Act 2 boss.\n\nThe flaw is, when I die to the boss, I have to repeat the whole boring grind from the start, through boring normal enemies again. \nThis is a rogue-lite, I know. But this is not Hades, where going through basic enemies feels fun because I have different Boons/Upgrades equipped. Going through basic enemies in Slay the Spire is a FREAKEN CHORE. \nI just want to challenge the boss again. I have no interest in fighting through basic/elite enemies in the grind. Again, that process is only fun the first time for each character. Starting the grind over with a crappy card pool feels like crap.\nSo here I am, quitting again. Won't recommend this to anybody because of this fatal flaw.",

Incredible variety with really well thought out scaling difficulty that makes the game really replayable as you keep getting better at it. I totally see how people put thousands of hours in this game. \n\nReally looking forward to the second game next year.",

I was recommended this game for years and like all people that play other card games you say \"Yeah sure I'll give it a try.\" but didn't for years. When the game went on sale I decided sure why not.  Holy crap. After over 360 hours a few months later with all characters at ascension 20 I can say I am kicking myself for not playing this amazing deck builder sooner. The game feels challenging right at the start because you are learning the cards and what feels good in a deck and what doesn't. But the game opens up the more you learn and the more you start to see the synergies between cards. It becomes addicting getting the farther and farther you go, the more wins you have and the higher your ascension. The game is almost perfectly balanced. The only thing I wanted more of is story even though without it, it is almost a perfect single player card game. All that being said that is not even mentioning the huge plethora of mods that can completely change the game play experience. I know I sounds like every other one of your other card player friends trying to get you into another game but, play the game. It's amazing.",

It's a dream come true for card battler enthusiasts.\n\nHere are the pros:\n- There are four characters in the game, each with their own unique style and abilities.\n- The characters can be played in various styles. Your warrior can choose to be a heavy-hitter, a shield-bearing tank, a swift and agile attacker, or a bottomless energy pit using his own health to get a constant power boost and dominate the board. You can also mix and match different playstyles using artifacts.\n- The game features a total of 730 cards and numerous relics.\n- Slay the Spire has a friendly learning curve, but it also offers challenges for players of all skill levels. After completing the game, you can enter ascension mode and face increasingly difficult levels.\n- The game offers different modes such as daily climbs and endless modes, adding more variety and fun.\n- Steam mod support is available, and there is a substantial expansion-sized mod for the game.\n- The game's art style is really cool.\n- Their musics are very well composed, it is addicting and harmonic.  \n- A sequel is set to be released in 2025.\n\nFor cons:\n- It's addicting.",

Goes on sale regularly, it's even on sale right now as I'm typing this so please do yourself a favor and buy it now if your budget allows it. Playtime is from when I played it when I had my brother's library a long time ago and only just now bought it on sale for less than $10 which is a steal!",

No direct achievement—you’re 100% dependent on good RNG to progress through the first map, less so on the second, and by the third, if you make it, not at all. But this means you’ll be \"rolling the dice\" every time just to be able to play.\n\n- Too linear: Not much to offer. Because of all the RNG, you get a random game each time, but this doesn’t change the fact that you’ll be doing the same thing over and over again.\n\n- No good objectives: I know this is a roguelike, not a roguelite, but besides unlocking more content, there’s no real reason to grind out a good game every single time.\n\nIn the end, I understand that this is a 7-year-old game, and when it was released, it was probably groundbreaking. But today, any game with these elements will deliver a better experience. If you want to try it, go for it, but keep in mind that it’s not worth the full price.",

        "review": "Good game, but I managed to beat it on my 8th run. Runs into a problem where the more you unlock the more difficult it is to do your build.\n\nTo make this game significantly better, I'd suggest creating some kind of a PvP mode where the final battle involves you versing others who made it to the end of the climb. I'd also suggest scrapping the idea that each character has a unique set of cards as this makes the idea of creating multiple characters too big of a task and instead focus on having 50 different characters with the only thing distinguishing them is aesthetics and beginning passive. The problem with making each character so specifically diverse and unique is that it accidentally creates a supremacy system where there's no point in picking certain characters.\n\nI also felt as though the upgrades for the characters being cards wasn't what I wanted. I would have preferred if the upgrades were passive buffs rather than extra activation cards. On my 5th run I came to the realisation that \"Power Cards\" combined with \"Relics\" were truly the only things that mattered in the game. Attack cards and Skill cards were nowhere near as powerful as passive bonuses. The cards being tucked in at the bottom of the screen the way they were was a bit annoying to read as you had to move your mouse left and right just to see what each card did rather than being able to comprehend all of them at once and come to a strategic conclusion without forgetting what was in your hand.",

Because the game requires you to be very deliberate with your decisions, it's not a game I can just play casually and just get into a flow state with. The flip side of this is that, because I know that almost all my losses were due to some part of my deck being lacking due to bad decision making on my part, it almost always has me wanting to go back in for just one more run to try to do better. It's a game that I exhausted just thinking about the idea of playing. I loathe the game, but for some reason I'm still looking forward to the next one.",

        "review": "oh i haven't left a review for this yet.\r\n\r\nenough has been said about StS, yes it's that good. It's honestly very rare for a game to inspire an entire genre and remain the best game in that genre for half a decade and counting. The magical thing about StS is it's a rare kind of video game you can revisit after a few years and, nothing in it has changed, but somehow, it feels completely different. You see the game with new eyes and suddenly all of your previous assumptions are a jumbled mess again. Your old reliable strategies suddenly stopped working, what changed? Cards you never looked twice at are suddenly crushing a run for you. A character you never fully understood clicks. A character you thought you'd mastered is completely eluding you.\r\n\r\nSlay the Spire is a really good roguelike deckbuilder. But the thing it has that many of its would-be successors do not is mystique. Can this or that thing be made to work? Is it good? How do you know when you can take it? Was that a fluke, or did you just invent a playstyle you hadn't considered until its pieces materialized for you? You won a run, impressive. Can you do it again, but cleaner this time, without coming so close to dying at this or that point--that deck was fun, could you have built it better, what was its core, what did you think was necessary but wasn't?\r\n\r\nEverything answer you arrive to in Slay the Spire is met with more questions. The game doesn't ask you them, it just presents problems and pieces of solutions. It teaches you to be curious, open-minded, and creative, beckons you to try and then try again. It isn't just special for the obvious reasons that it is well-designed, balanced, a fun interplay of little challenges and exciting rewards. It is special because it infects you with a mental itch that nothing else really seems to scratch. You begin by trying to overcome a run, and end up trying to overcome an ocean.\r\n\r\nHow incredibly appropriate that at the beginning of the game, we are greeted by a monstrous whale.",

        "review": "Slay the spire has been an absolute break-out title that revolutionized and frankly rocketed the genre into the stratosphere. It's difficult to find any deck-building rogue-like that doesn't take direct influence from this game, and the reasons are in spades. \nThe game is extremely easy to pick up and play, and through playing you'll unlock a couple handfuls of extra cards for each character. These unlocks help put into your mind various builds you can find or curate for a character on a given run. It takes extreme consideration and skill to develop a catalog of cards that can be generally good when put into a random deck, but then really shine when paired with others like it.\nEverything about this game is fantastic and I heartily recommend playing it. \n\nSlay the Spire 2 was announced recently and I'm superbly exited to play it.",

I know that sounds weird but it's focused on game mechanics more than Lore and Sparkles etc. Not to say those are bad but it has to do with the percent of priorities.\n\nThis game is at least 95% game mechanics and 5% other if you want to go deeper. I'm more attached to mechanical gameplay than fantasy gameplay even though I absolutely love Warhammer Fantasy and 40k as example (I own a couple thousand dollars worth of 40k models since the 1990s; love that table top game). Most other games they make good trailers by making it 80% sparkles and pretend it's deeper than it needs to be, just not priorities I align to.\n\nBecause I knew it was an actual game, the second I saw Kickstarter for the board game, I was willing to bend over backwards for it. My IRL friends (except 1) never heard of Slay The Spire before until sitting down to play it but after playing 1 round of the board game, they were hooked and now I see them more often, exactly what a board game needs to do. Now I'm afraid to even suggest they should get the Steam version in case I don't see them as often :steamsad: but it's a ridiculously good game. Not sure if this is a review of the board game or this Steam game at this point butt f♥♥♥ it, they are both incredibly great. Expect a good challenge and fun af kinda like FTL. If FTL made a board game, i'd throw money at that too, their loss",

        "review": "I think this is the first game I've played where I genuinely have no idea what people see in it. After playing Balatro, I was looking for another card game and this is popular on here and recommended on reddit. Maybe this is something you can play on your phone? And it is really good compared to other phone games? When learning the mechanics I found a streamer that had played the game for 5000 hours. I can only imagine the kind of trauma he was dealing with at the time to use this crappy, shallow game as a diversion.\r\n\r\nOverall, I found the game to be tedious and unrewarding. Though that is really underselling it: I would audibly groan when faced with a mob of enemies because it meant a turn might last longer. The worst part of the game was actually playing a round, and everything else (shops, route selection) was just a nice break from the tedium of the core gameplay. I have three main complaints:\r\n\r\n1) It is visually static. Numbers sometimes appear on-screen and there is a slashing animation, but nothing seems to actually happen. It is like watching a freeze-frame highlight reel, and an uneventful one at that. I kept waiting for there to be something on-screen that seemed to justify the time I was spending. But there is nothing. At the end your character is on the ground (there isn't even a proper death animation) and you get a summary list of some stats. That's it? Really? And when you win it isn't much better. I really struggle to see how people are feeling rewarded by a game that gives you nothing back.\r\n\r\n2) The decision-making process behind card selection is extremely obvious. There is no fun to be had thinking of how cards might combine in interesting ways, because 99% of the time they either don't combine or you get maybe 1 card in your hand that combines with another. But even then, it isn't challenging - everything is so obvious that you feel like the game may as well be playing itself.\r\n\r\n3) The game really suffers from the RNG deck-building mechanics. Given the incredibly shallow mechanics, you can see how the game might actually be fun if you could make more choices initially to set things up in interesting ways. But what happens in practice is that you are given a very limited number of choices based on luck. It's not just that a run becomes better or worse due to luck, luck factors into whether the game is even halfway interesting to play. And most of the time it just isn't.",

There are total of four classes and four decks of cards. Each main class has sub classes based on your built (for example, the assassin can be main shiv or main poison). Each class also has 1-10 difficulty levels. I am currently at level 6. So there is a lot more to enjoy. I hope they create more classes/characters! I wouldn't mind to buy dlc.",

That said, it did not hold my attention.  I respect what the game has done, but the art characters and mechanics fell a little bit flat for me.  That said, I do not regret having purchased this title for my library.  I'm very happy to have played this game and learned a few things from it.  Similar to watching a classic movie that has inspired or shaped some of your newer favorite films.  I'm going to give Slay the Spire a moderate recommendation if you enjoy Roguelike Deckbuilders.  After all it did innovate the genera into what it is today.",

Modding scene is incredible and adds 100s of extra hours of gameplay. Biggest downside... Lacking content. Wish they would make a 2nd game or add lore about what's going on with the heart/bosses. Game also feels too short sometimes since each floors goes quick especially once you know what you're doing. \n\nStill one of the most influential games/rogue-likes of all time. There are still no deck-builders that have managed to do it quite like STS before or after it released. Still has me coming back 5 yrs after it came out.",

Great for casual play or speed runs. There is such a variety of cards and characters that you can replay it again and again and again. Gaining ever increasing rewards and challenges that make each run unique. With an added bonus of different modes and community mods, you'll be caught climbing the spire too, wondering if the next step is the top.",

        "review": "After about 200 hours (which is—considering how deep this game is—not a lot at all) and after getting every single achievement, both on Steam and in the in-game percentage counter, I can confidently say that Slay the Spire—made by Mega Crit—is my favorite Roguelike Deckbuilder (and a Card Game in general), surpassing everything I've experienced in a similar genre, whether single-player or multiplayer.\n\nThere are four playable characters in Slay the Spire, each with its own unique flavor, design, cards, mechanics, relics, and builds. This variety offers countless ways to play, allowing you to navigate through challenging encounters, pick and remove cards along the way, improve your deck, and face challenging (but not unfair) bosses in each act. While the game is not difficult to grasp in its fundamentals—especially if you've played other card games and deckbuilders—it is quite challenging and mechanically deep. But worry not; each loss is a learning experience that enhances your knowledge and skills, eventually bringing you to a point where you can comfortably and consistently beat the game on 0/low Ascensions—the term that refers to an additional difficulty system that is unlocked after the player has successfully completed a run with a character. Each Ascension level, naturally, increases the game's difficulty by adding new challenges, such as tougher enemies, reduced rewards, and more. High Ascensions are, of course, extremely challenging but all the more satisfying when you beat them. This, coupled with how many different ways a run can go, offers near-infinite replay value.\n\nAs far as the art style is concerned, you'll hear mixed opinions. This was a surprise for me at first because I have nothing against it and actually like it very much. It is simple, yes, but quite unique in its own way—pleasant to look at. However, the UI/Menu sections of the game could use some work—they are completely functional, but I think aesthetically they had a lot more potential. In addition to this, the fact that there are no unlockable skins for the characters, no unlockable card frames, and no additional card arts (apart from Beta arts, but that's it) is quite unfortunate, as these features would help keep certain aesthetic aspects of the game feel fresh and diverse. I hope they add these features in Slay the Spire 2. And polish the game a bit more, as it still has few bugs and glitches here and there, some allowing you to exploit game mechanics. \n\nSound effects—like the clicking sounds, the sounds of flipping a page, etc.—are extremely satisfying and competently done, but the soundtrack, in my opinion, is a mixed bag. It’s not bad by any means, but it can get quite boring and repetitive.\n\nOverall, Slay the Spire is a masterful blend of strategy, challenge, and replayability, making it a standout in the Roguelike Deckbuilder genre. Despite few minor shortcomings and specific avenues that can be improved, the game offers a deeply rewarding experience that keeps you coming back for more. Whether you’re a seasoned card game enthusiast or a newcomer, this game is definitely worth your time.",

Anyone who has played this game long enough for it to \"click\" will likely never truly stop playing it. If the sequel somehow surpasses the original, I may never go outside again.",

No information overload when you start\n* UI makes it easy to play strategically (e.g. a +6 attack card will show +4 when debuffed so you don't have to remember)\n* Card effects are simple to predict, making it easy to plan ahead and get synergy\n* Extreme replay value (like Hades, FTL, etc)\n\nMy only complaints are that card effects can't be read without hovering each one, and music doesn't immediately stop when pressing Escape (alt-tab works though).",

No run is the same which I really enjoy and depending on how your run goes you get to experiment with different cards and relics depending on which character you chose and you will find synergy's that can carry you through a run. The game also has very high replay value not just with all the characters and combos you can find but with achievements and mod support that also keeps the game feeling fresh and you will want to come back for more. I'm highly looking forward to the sequel.",

        "review": "YES. Play this. At first it feels very random, then you get to know the game and over time know what and how different cards work together. Many you tube videos on how to and what to do if you are unsure. This is a game you MUST have in your Library. Buy on sale and enjoy - 10/10. (260 hours+ so far and still a 10/10) The best card deck game available. It will steal your time and you won't even know it - when's the last time that happened with a game?\nIf you like strategy, like RNG, like risk and reward, like to see how YOU can create big plays and set up your turn to play passive def or aggressive dps or as many cards as you can or as minimal then trust, this is worth your time.\nThere are mods, different bosses to beat, each with their own style, enjoyable encounters which make you think about what you need to do in order to defeat them. Excellent sound, addictive game play with interesting characters you can choose from. A must have. \n",
