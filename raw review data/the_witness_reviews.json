[/h1]\n\nThat was my first amazed thought when finishing this game [spoiler] not talking about \"Endgame\", but about the credits' ending [/spoiler]. I entered this game without any idea of what would it be, but it progressively surpassed every initial expectation.\nThis game sure isn't for everyone, as it could make you lose patience more than a few times (I actually had to get away from the screen sometimes because of frustration). That said, I believe it's one of the greatest puzzle games ever made. Everything, from ambiance to sound and light contributes to it, and it's meticulously curated to be beautiful and philosophical. More than a game, it's \"artwork\" at its finest.\n\nMost reviewers suffer about its ending, but I choose to think it's part of its mystery. If you really grasp what the \"Challenge\" tells you, you'll understand it's not ment to be closed, let alone be solved. Please, don't play this game expecting it to REWARD YOU, because you'll be disappointed. But, then again, you have to sit patiently to hear what the \"Challenge\" is about, and considering the fact that only 5% of the players got it at the time of writing this, and the fact that you HAVE to understand the logic behind the puzzles to get it, I'm not expecting everyone to figure it out.\n\n[spoiler] Bach died before finishing \"Die Kunst der Fuge\", the most extense and complex fugue of his lifetime: hearing this made it all make sense to me. [/spoiler]\nStanding ovation for everyone involved in this game.",

        "review": "The main theme of \"The Witness\" is the brief moments of \"enlightenment\" that come when you find a solution to an seemingly unsolvable problem. The game develops this theme to the point of absurdity. From the simplest puzzles on the screen to the geography of the entire game world, every part of \"The Witness\" serves this purpose. The game drives you through an obsession with the search for \"meaning,\" treating meaning as the ultimate problem, and it does this well. Even the pause menu is black like closed eyes, with outlines of puzzle shapes, emphasizing the omnipresence and obsession with solving riddles, as if the player thinks only about this and sees nothing else.\n\nBut that is also a problem with \"The Witness\". The sheer number of variations on the same puzzle becomes overwhelming and tedious, and the moments of enlightenment are no longer enough to keep up with the quantity of puzzles. You begin to wish for concrete answers regarding what is happening on the island, and at some point, you just want the game to end. Everything the game offers you up to that point—through audiobooks, petrified people in ordinary and extraordinary situations, and films—is not sufficient; it might even be discouraging, as these pieces of information are half-puzzles themselves, leaving you without any real motivation to engage with them seriously.\n\nThere is no concrete resolution. I won’t spoil the ending, but after struggling through the last puzzles, you receive no answer.  Maybe I missed some crucial information in the remaining films or audiobooks, but as I said, I didn't have the will to seek them out, and now I even doubt they would reveal anything new to me. \n\nDon’t get me wrong; \"The Witness\" is a phenomenal study of puzzles and should be played as such. I’m giving it a negative rating solely because the ending disappointed me so much that my main impression after the whole game is that I wasted too much time, which isn’t good.",

The only thing that kept me going was the pretty scenery, and even that was irritatingly artificial – paths you couldn't leave, rocky bits only there to keep you out  of the next area. And no obvious logical progression in which bit you needed to solve next. I did finally complete it (thanks to all the walkthrough creators out there – you do stellar work!) and even the ending is extremely irritating, because you can't even go back at the end and explore the pretty landscape with all the puzzles solved. Plus, right near the end there's a REALLY flashy/moving bit that made me feel quite ill and would be impossible for anyone more visually sensitive.\r\n\r\nAll in all, like a poor version of the Talos Principle, without any of the sense of achievement.

The game does a great job of organically introducing you to new concepts, and confounding you when you're not ready for more advanced ones. The way that so many puzzles break out and interact with the game world is amazing. Yes, some types are better than others, but the game still allows you to get the \"main\" ending if you skip a few sections.\r\n\r\nThat said, a lot of the criticism about the rest of the game is fair. Traversal is often unnecessarily slow. The \"story\" is insubstantial and/or pretentious. And the less said about the ending the better. But if you love challenging yourself with cleverly iterative puzzles, you can approach the game with that lens and not let the rest of it bother you.\r\n\r\nYou should only take what you want from this game. You don't have to solve EVERYTHING (which seems tedious even to a completionist like me). There is no achievement for it, or even a real progress tracker. In fact the harder stuff can be so obtuse that it seems designed for collaboration.\r\n\r\nJust carve out your own path through this world. Enjoy it, and be okay knowing that it's bigger than any one person.",

At its core, this is more than just a puzzle game—it’s an experience that invites you to question how you see and understand reality. From the moment I set foot on its mysterious island, I knew I was in for something profound, but I never anticipated how deeply it would rewire my thought processes.\n\nAs you progress, The Witness steadily expands your mind. Each puzzle is a test of perception, and the beauty of the game lies in its quiet, yet full of beautiful sound design and ambience, elegant genius. The further you go, the more you realize that the only thing limiting your understanding is your own perspective. The game doesn’t hand anything to you; it gives you the tools to succeed in a non-verbal way, but you have to be willing to look closer, to notice the subtle, intricate patterns hidden in plain sight.\n\nThe feeling of solving each puzzle is euphoric, but it’s more than that—it’s a revelation. You begin to understand that you aren’t just solving puzzles; you’re learning to observe, to pay attention to details that seemed irrelevant before. The more open you are to seeing beyond the surface, the more the world of The Witness reveals itself to you. And it’s not just about the puzzles themselves—it’s about how the game makes you realize that in life, too, we often only see what we’re willing to see.\n\nEvery area of the island is coherently themed around a specific idea. Each zone feels distinct, with its own set of rules, visual cues, and atmosphere, subtly guiding you to grasp the concept it’s trying to teach. Each area \"is about something\". The architecture, the unique artistic visuals and colors, and even the extremely well crafted sound design work together to gently nudge you towards understanding without ever spelling it out.\n\nThese areas aren’t just backdrops—they’re designed to suggest their secrets. As you explore, the way each space is crafted practically whispers clues to you, encouraging you to observe, experiment, and learn. The game operates on the principle that true understanding requires effort and introspection. If you rush through, you’ll miss the subtleties and nuances that make the experience so rich.\n\nIt’s this meticulous attention to detail that makes every part of the island feel alive and meaningful, pulling you into the game’s world and making each revelation feel earned.\n\nAnd it never feels repetitive. Every puzzle introduces a fresh, new idea, challenging you in unique ways, and the game constantly forces you to think like a scientist. You’re not just guessing—you’re experimenting, forming hypotheses, testing them, and learning from each failure. Just when you think you’ve figured things out, it introduces a twist, or a partial carefully placed obfuscation, forcing you to adapt your thinking and test your hypothesis.\n\nPuzzles don’t exist in isolation. Everything is connected to everything else. They build on one another, coming together in spectacular and often unimaginable ways. The process is methodical yet incredibly creative, as you're driven to break down problems, refine your approach, and discover the deeper logic behind each challenge. It’s like performing scientific experiments on your own perception. The further you go, the more you realize how the game’s mechanics compose a brilliant system that rewards careful observation and persistent curiosity. Each solution opens up new layers of understanding in ways that are mind-blowing.\n\nIn essence, The Witness teaches that meaningful insight is born from patience and curiosity, making every moment spent in its world incredibly valuable.\n\nThank you, Jon. :)\n\n",

        "review": "The Witness is a really unique game, but not something I would recommend to most people I know.\n\nThe game resembles old open-world puzzle games like Myst, where you learn rules to a puzzle in one place and apply them somewhere else in the world. In The Witness this is meant literally - The only progress you make is in your own understanding of the world and the puzzles. Theoretically, you could immediately solve every puzzle, but you probably lack the understanding to do so while at the beginning of the game and may need to return to some of them later, when you understand what e.g. blue and orange dots on the lines mean or what you are supposed to do when a red star is on the board. \n\nSo for this whole game, you explore the island the game is set on, and slowly make small discoveries about the world around you. The areas are incredibly varied in how they look, how they play, how you progress, what kind of puzzles they include, and no matter where you go, it will help you in getting closer to completing the game. Sometimes, a solution to a puzzle is a bit tedious or just a bit confusing to figure out, but I was rarely really stuck in the game, and I never felt like the puzzles were too easy or unfairly hard.\n\nHowever I think the pricing is a bit... much. It's very well-polished for an Indie game and a really nice experience, and the game is really wonderful to look at, but asking for 37€ for a game that is 8 years old and that you'll get 9-15 hours of gameplay out of is kind of a lot. I bought it on sale, where I think the price was more appropriate. \n\nThe other thing is, that I think this is a game that is almost more interesting to play for game developers than it is for actual players. It's a wonderful game to analyse in terms of how it handles tutorials, progression, exploration, level design, and I was really fascinated by all of these aspects and could already write whole papers on it, but I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed the game on the same level if I wouldn't have been thinking about how clever the design of these aspects was all the time. But maybe I'm also just not really the target audience for a game like this.\n\nSo generally, I had a very fun time with the game, I don't think I would personally recommend it for the asking price, and you might need to be really into games like Myst or be a game designer to really get a nice experience out of The Witness.",

Get a guide.\r\n\r\nIf the Talos Principle is the gateway drug to the hard stuff, this is the hard stuff. It's Myst's hardcore sibling from another marriage.\r\n\r\nAesthetically this game is amazing, and everything I want from a game like this. The open world alone is worth sinking time into this.\r\n\r\nPhilosophically? Long-winded. If the puzzles don't give you a headache, the philosophy behind this game will.\r\n\r\nAs for the puzzles, they are frustrating. They teach you the rules, and then throw those rules in your face, screaming \"THOUGHT YOU WERE CLEVER WERE YOU??\". Even with using a guide, I said to myself multiple times \"Okay, that makes sense, but I would have NEVER figured that out on my own.\" If you completed this game without a guide, consider yourself a MENSA-certified NERD.\r\n\r\nThe ending is a slap to the face. Literally like \"Lol, you did all this work? You cute little MENSA-Nerd.\" If you have the time/energy/sanity, go for the secret ending, because in that, guides MIGHT NOT HELP.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, buy it for the aestethics, but for the love of god, don't pretend like you're going to get enlightened and solve this like the Talos Principle. The game discourages that kind of optimism. Get a guide.",

Nice scenery, but hated running long distances between points (same reason I quit Morrowind). Also got motion sickness from the stairs speed being much faster than level ground, but likely because I haven't played FPS view in a while. \r\n\r\nTook advantage of a sale so was out only $10.

I will adjust this review if need be. \n\nThe thing is: It's drop dead gorgeous. The style is absoloutely wonderful, there's tons of exploration to be done and it's very relaxing. But: In terms of gameplay it appears to be incredibly thin. How it works is basically that you follow cables to the next puzzle or paths to the next area. All puzzles are some variation on a labyrith and it gets old so quick. \n\nI don't want to punish the dev, because they did create a little island that I like, but it's definately not worth 36,99€ and if I had it bought at that price, I'd immediately get a refund. 9,24€ is still a little steep in my opinion, but I'll likely keep it. In any case: If you were the kinda kid who died of joy from tracing the labyrinth on the back of the cereal box, you'll likely love it, otherwise haven't been warned, but hopefully informed.",

        "review": "I liked the game enough to beat it and some of the puzzles were really good. But the mental grind you have to endure to get to the end is not very satisfying. Such as having to listen to the \"inspirational messages\" you come across (annoying philosophical ramblings) from long dead crazy folks.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of different puzzles to solve though. Some you will like. Some you will hate. But once they start to abuse the puzzle mechanics, you will soon hate all of them! Some of the later ones I really wonder how people with (minor) disabilities (colour blindness, prone to seizures, motion sickness) could possibly solve them.\r\n\r\nI agree that the ending is very underwhelming. I think the whole game is supposed to be “about the arts” or something. Like people who put broken toilet bowls in an art museum and expect others to be enthralled by it. I would rather watch a movie like The Matrix and then wonder if I really am in a simulation for the next few days. The Talos Principle at least did that for me.\r\n\r\nBut if you get this at 75% off and wander around for a few hours, its worth it for that. Paying full price or trying to 100% this is just crazy. Though I might 100% it someday with major help of a walk-through. Either way, I don’t see myself playing this again for fun.",

        "review": "Very relaxing and unique puzzle game. The beautiful environment and serene soundscape create a hypnotic atmosphere for exploring and solving puzzles. The puzzles themselves are well designed and offer a great challenge. The design decision to make it where you have to explore the island to understand all of the puzzle mechanics makes for a very satisfying gameplay loop. You will finally find a tutorial for a mechanic and then remember all the places you previously saw that mechanic, excited to go finally solve those puzzles. The game's \"story\" is somewhat lacking, requiring an immense effort on the player to make it pretty far into the game and also decipher it from its clues just for a pretty underwhelming reveal. However, the story really doesn't matter all too much in this case. The main appeal, at least for me, was the puzzles and solving all their mechanics, and that part was satisfying enough that the lack of a satisfying story didn't bother me all that much.",

There's plenty of numerous puzzle style for you to solve. \r\n\r\nFor me, this game is a bit too much as there is no particular order for you to be familiar with the puzzle first. The puzzle is quite hard and hurt your eye sometimes (e.g. flashing light or spinning). However, I think this is a good game.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this game for someone who is a hardcore puzzle game, but not someone who play puzzle casually. That's because this game has no hint and most of the time, you need to figure how the puzzle work by yourself which make even a puzzle lover like me still think it's too hard sometimes.",

Only after playing Elden Ring, I've learned to skip difficult enemies (puzzles?) and come back later to those after levelling up (learning more puzzles?) a bit. The same is true with this game. If you encounter a puzzle that you don't understand, go do other puzzles and come back. Some early puzzles are purposefully made difficult until you've learned those mechanics later in the game.\n\nAlso, it is better to go blind into this one. No hints! The game provides plenty. Every new type of puzzle starts easy. And there are secrets! So, so many secrets!\n\nPlay time: first time around 20+hrs, second time 7hrs. There are so many puzzles, you'll forget some if you play again.",

The puzzles and gameplay range from good at times, to incredibly boring and monotonous the majority of the playthrough. \r\n\r\nI got this after playing 'The Looker', a free game that is a spoof of this game. You are better off just playing 'The Looker' as it is free and takes the ideas of this puzzle game and make it funny, enjoyable, and shorter.\r\n\r\nI ended up beating the game because I wanted to like it, and although I ended up really not liking it. I will say that after you beat the game [spoiler] I really like the bonus challenge that you get a hidden achievement for. Like legit, after playing 10+ hours of mind numbing, boring puzzles and thinking the game had nothing I really liked, the last challenge is actually really fun and well made. I wish that the whole game had been more like that. I haven't managed to completed it yet, but hope to eventually. [/spoiler] \r\n\r\nSo yeah, for a 40 dollar game, I really don't think it is worth it, even on sale I feel like the game isn't so much fun as it is overly repetitive and boring. I'm sure there are some that will disagree, but I was left a bit disappointed.",

        "review": "No other game has made me feel as underwhelmed as The Witness.\n\nLet's start with the puzzles. I loved them a lot and I wouldn't change a thing. The game does a great job teaching you its mechanics, not by explaining them to you, but by letting you experiment on less complex puzzles to rule out what works and what doesn't. It's excellent game design. My only complaint is a timed segment which is more dependent on luck than skill in my experience.\n\nGraphics. You see the trailer. It's 50 hours of that hyper-saturated goodness in an environment so carefully crafted that no strand of grass is in the wrong place. Just make sure to turn on the crosshair, turn up the FOV and turn off V-Sync so you don't get motion sick.\n\nPhilosophy. A lot of people praise this game's existentialism, but it didn't really do it for me. The game takes an aggressively neutral stance which works to its detriment. It's like having a textbook read at you and they don't offer much if you have at least a basic knowledge of philosophy. The only thing that made me think was when they finally stopped quoting people and made a point about how atheism can only exist in contradiction to theism and has trouble standing on its own. I didn't agree with them, but it did make me think. Sadly, that was in an area that few players will ever access.\n\nThe mystery. It sucks. I can't adequately articulate how much it sucks. It is so underwhelming that every theory you have while playing the game will be better than what the \"conclusion\" is, if you can even call it that. To give you an idea, every once in a while I asked for guidance online so I knew I was heading in the right direction. On my last post I asked for hints once again and laid out my current theories and open leads, only to find out that my game had already come to its end. I had discovered everything. For context I have seen both endings of this game and both times my basic intuition as a writer and game designer was \"Oh, that's just a fakeout ending\" and both times the endings were REAL.\n\nNow, I have to be honest with you. This game has a trick up its sleeve. Your experience with the game will heavily depend on when you discover this trick. If you find it late, you will be gifted a second game to play. If you find it early, you will spend the rest of your playthrough wondering if that was it or if there's something else. It's an odd choice from a game design perspective as people who enjoy puzzle games are more likely to think outside the box, but if you think outside the box too early you won't get the extra special experience that is meant to be a part of this game. Who was this made for?\n\nIn conclusion, I can't recommend The Witness in good faith. While the puzzles are good, the promise of a mystery and a subversive experience is never truly delivered on, and it's all wrapped up in a bow of contextless quotes and videos you can watch for free elsewhere. Go read Tao Te King instead.",

        "review": "I will try to be as spoiler free as possible in this review, however obviously I cannot be spoiler completely spoiler free.\nAfter having heared a lot of good about this game I decided to try this. And I hope that if your ead it that you don't.\n\nMy issues:\n\n1. The price: I am sorry. While I didn't 100% it, I finished the game in 13 hours. That means I finished all areas and anything else that I found, and while I did look out for secrets, I didn't go searc every corner over and over again and there is definitely some stuff I missed. I bought this game on sale for 10€ and don't really feel like I got my moneys worth, it does not have the same playtime or enjoyment as any game I have seen that cost 40€. Unless the stuff I missed can quadrouple my playtime while constantly being enjoyable.\n\n2. Accessibility: This game is not accessibile for a lot of people. Are you colourblind or have some other visual impairment? Don't play it. Do you have any hearing impairments or something similar? Don't play it. In addition to having no accessibility settings, in an usual playthrough, most of these puzzles will only show up AFTER the 2 hour mark has long been crossed, meaning if a disabled person bought this game without knowing about these issues would not be able to refund it. There are subtitles but they don't help with the sound puzzles. Only with the videos.\n\n3. The videos: There are secret puzzles that hide videos. Just videos, that are usually only a person talking into a camera about something related to the message of the game. Just a real person talking or walking. Nothing exciting or puzzling. Just boring. I managed to find all but one and they easily are combined longer than 1 hour. You might say \"don't watch them\", but a) they are a part of the game and I tried to experience as much as possible b) they are rewards for puzzles and the first few times I legit hoped something directly relevant to the game would happen and c) its just frustating that your reward for exploring is... this.\n\n4. The slowness. This game is slow. A lot of my playtime was just spend with walking from area to area, from puzzle to puzzle. Eventually you unlock a fast travel method but a lot of time it feels like walking would just have been faster, as the fast travel is slow. I don't care if this is the vision or something, I don't mind games being slow at times but after 13 hours it gets annoying.\n\n5. The puzzles. While the huge majority of puzzles are enjoyable and enganing, sometimes they were frustating. And honestly, I did look up a few puzzles. And while sometimes I thought \"how the hell was I supposed to figure this out???\" There was one area, where idk if its an impairment I have or if I am just a weirdo but I had to look up EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE. I  understood the patern, I honestly felt physically unable to figure out the solution by myself [spoiler](it was the jungle area btw)[/spoiler].\n\n5. 1. In addition to that there is no clear approach to puzzles. For some you have to figure it out directly. For some you have to try for a long time. For some you have to solve other puzzles beforehand. Not just to understand the mechanics, but to be able to solve the puzzle sometimes you need to solve another one before (you can still try tho).\n\n6. The about this game section is just untrue. There is no such story about you regaining your memories. And the game does not respect your time.\n\nWhile I can't say I didn't enjoy this game, I cannot in good faith recommend this game.",

        "review": "Everyone says that this is such a genius puzzle game, the use of the environment, the logic, the scenery, and so many great things… I just didn’t like it. The game is based on several types of puzzles and most of them are really not fun (like the reflection ones, the sound ones, or the ones in the greenhouse). And for those that can be fun, they eventually become so convoluted that they are more annoying than fun, really.\n\nOkay, so instead of complaining I will try to explain why this personally didn’t land. Everything is about panels that need a certain path to get solved, and sometimes when you think you understand a mechanic, the game just tricks you. A fundamental part of the learning process is understanding the bases to keep moving forward, but if you didn’t quite understand the basics, or if you forgot about them, The Witness will NOT remind you of them.\n\nIt’s good that games teach you mechanics indirectly and that players can learn by themselves, but I’m just saying that if those mechanics can be really confusing, the game should at least provide some guidance. It would have been so nice if after each area you could have kept track of the things you did and its variations, but no. \n\nI have tried enjoying this game, but I simply can’t.",

        "review": "I'm really sad to give this game a negative review as I hoped to enjoy it a lot. Overall very beautiful but also very tiring and rather pointless game. At first I thought there will be only environmental story telling - what would be very interesting to me. Finding first audiolog was a little dissapointing, especially it was neither deep nor interesting. There are a few philosophicall tropes in there but they aren't really explored and they felt disconnected from the rest of the game. Ending is just bad. At times it felt more like a slow walking simulator then anything else.\n\nThis game has a lot (and I mean A LOT) of puzzles and some of them I really enjoyed - first 15 times. Sadly, they were to repetitve to keep me engaged in a long run. There is a nice intoduction to solving puzzles, unfortunately it could be confusing at times. There was at least one type of puzzle where I solved a few easier ones, then got stucked only to find out that I misunderstood the concept of puzzle. I also found two genuine bugs in more complicated puzzles - I got it right (checked everything a few times) but it didn's pass as solved - apparently there was only one solution programmed while more possibilities were available. In a few locations puzzels didn't really get more difficoult or complex, only more annoying by distorting or obscuring screen. Also, some types of puzzle were solved by walking around to find one, correct spot to look from, which got tidius quickly. As for the environmental puzzles... where do I even begin... Way, way to many for me, although I appreciate the idea.\n\nExploration was fine but I was expecting a little bit more. Beautifull locations that suggest some kind of story behind them but never really tell or even hint the story - that was probably most disappointing to me. This game had great ideas but many of them felt underdeveloped or overly complex with no payoff. When I finished the game I was relieved that it's finally over. Maybe that game just wasn't for me.",

Mazes are everywhere, to the point of leading the player to obsession... a consequence that I still believe to be the [i]true[/i] point of this game.\n\nThis game is all about puzzles, finding patterns and meanings, understanding without being told the rules... and obsession. An obsession that stems from the very concept of the game, fed by hours of peaceful thinking and untangling the rules of the puzzles. You already know it as this weird obsession every gamer has felt at least once in their life. This gripping obsession that leads the player to see the game outside of the game, be it in dreams or when awake. That very obsession that superimposes a videogame masterpiece to one's everyday life while the game is not completed.\n\nAt first, there are mazes to solve everywhere inside of the game. Until you discover that actually, there are also mazes everywhere outside of the game.",

Some of them are seriously hard to solve because of the difficult access to must-have indications (for example, patterns in shady trees).\r\nSome puzzles won't be pleasant to people affected by color blindness. Also, some require the understanding of primary colors (it could be deduced by playing with available filters).\r\nBe prepared to help yourself with colored pencils and sheets of (5x5 mm) graphing paper for the toughest mazes.\r\nA large, nicely colored, and impressive 3D environment, you can move on earth, under the earth, on the sea... but never fall :) you cannot die, you never need to save (automatic), thus drawback: no multiplayer course on a same computer.\r\nBoss levels inside the mountain! :)\r\nAdditional challenge: find as many maze-like paths as possible in the scenery!",

Even for me, who doesn't have epilepsy or (usually) motion sickness issues, the puzzles in this area were headache inducing, and the spinning panels actually made me nauseous. These aren't skippable puzzles, either; they're in the final area of the main game, directly on the path to the ending. And there are puzzles in other areas that, while not as egregious, could be similarly problematic. It would cost nothing to at least display a text warning when booting up the game. I would otherwise recommend [i]The Witness[/i], but this is just too big of an issue for me.",

If you're looking for something similar to Myst, Talos etc, this is about as far from it as you can get while still being in the same 'genre'. If you like doing Sudoku, crosswords or yes, mazes... this might be fun for a few days I guess. At SIXTY DOLLARS (aud) I can't recommend it.

        "review": "     The Witness is a great puzzle game set on a beautiful yet haunting island. The core gameplay consists of solving the line maze puzzles that you see in screenshots of the game, and that's it. The whole thing is line puzzles. It might not be for everyone, but these puzzles are really well made and placed throughout areas very thoughtfully. There are tons of different mechanics present to explore and master within these simple little puzzles and I personally never found them to get stale over the course of my playthrough. \r\n     It's important to note that the reward for solving most of the optional puzzles is simply the gratification of completing it. Beating the main game gives an achievement and an ending, and theres a little extra thing that players can do to get a second achievement, but that's about it. About half of the game is mandatory, and the rest is optional puzzles that give essentially no reward. It's a little odd, but it allows everyone to play until they've decided that they're done, and I think it was a good idea. This also means that there is very, very little story. There are environmental hints at some sort of a plot, but the actual concrete details are very few and hard to find. Overall, this is a good game for those who want a good, challenging puzzle experience.",

        "review": "Spoilers ahead\r\n\r\nPros: \r\nFantastic visuals, minimalist art style but enough detail to immerse you. \r\nDiverse set of puzzles that build on unique mechanics that are fair most of the time and some leaving you kicking yourself once you get it. \r\nThe puzzles overall really make you think and the game even pushes you to accept that you might not know how to do something, and in turn rewards you for exploring. All the main puzzles have a way of easing you into them, even if the gimmick isn't clear right away. Post game content that gives you more to do after beating the main puzzles is a nice touch. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\nMost puzzles are fine, but there are a few that just feel like a cheap gimmick and arent really ones that test your thinking. Also some mechanics that are very ambiguous and leave multiple valid interpretations based on how vaguely previous game mechanics were introduced. The whole mysteriousness of the game is part of the vibe, but limits a few puzzles from feeling fair to the player, especially the one at the bottom of the mountain. Its the only puzzle of its kind and there is no setup that helps you understand the unique mechanic to it. \r\n\r\nStory, I get some people might say its a deep philosophic wonder, but its really just some distantly relevant quotes to overcoming challenges or observing the world around you. The game had so many cool and unique locations and dropped several hints at lore, but then in a post game voice line they jokingly throw it out the window. They were so close to having something great and just didnt finish this aspect of the game \r\n\r\nRecap: \r\nFantastic puzzle game with majority of puzzles being fair yet complex enough to make you think differently. Story is basically nonexistent, although there is some opportunity for lore if they make a sequel, and some of the recordings had some good outlooks that the player could use to approach the game or just life in general. Despite the nit picking I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games or likes a challenge. Its not an easy game but if you commit to not solving everything on the first go you will have a ton of fun no matter your experience with puzzle games. If its on sale 100% pick this up.",

        "review": "I'm constantly going back and forth on this and I think I have to leave it as this. There are a lot of incredible things about the Witness, the art style is great, the puzzles take what you might think of as a pretty simple puzzle and continue expanding on it in such a way that it remains addictive. Typically the amount of \"thinking outside the box\" you have to do for these puzzles is long in an incredible way where even after you see and understand the mechanics it still takes you a while to figure out. There's so many cool secrets in the game that you could be exploring it for what may feel endlessly. \n\nThe problem is that this is not always the case in the Witness. Being an open world puzzle game is an interesting concept and in some ways it's great but at the same time... It's not great when you're spending sometimes hours trying to find the where you can learn about this new mechanics to enter a new area that may or not not even use the mechanic you just used to enter. Obviously many would argue that the open-worldness aspect of the game is necessary because that difference in perspective is crucial for solving many of the puzzles, secrets puzzles and \"base game\" puzzles alike. But to be honest that doesn't really justify the issue imo. Many of the environmental puzzles are frankly infuriating because even when you know the mechanic, you have to spend all you're time looking for the \"correct\" solution instead of wracking in your brain how the line might work. Some great examples of this is the monastery where its incredibly simple, but because of what I mentioned earlier I spent way what time on this than I would have liked because I \"wasn't seeing this the right way.\" It's incredibly alloying because in addition I could sometimes find another route where the line worked and I was following the rule, but again it wasn't the \"correct\" solution, but I feel that it should either be designed such that I wouldn't be able to find such a solution or it just doesn't exist at all. \n\nAnother example of an not ideal environmental puzzle is the jungle. Maybe I'm just tone deaf, or maybe I don't appreciate sound messing with me in such a way where it doesn't feel like there's any rhyme or reason to it. Again, when I am solving a puzzle I want to consciously be wracking my brain trying to think of and testing the different possibilities until I find the correct one that works, not simply trying to have \"better intuition\" or something like that. \n\nOne of the worst things about peoples response or defense of this is that \"oh well you just didn't get it\" or sometimes they'll go with the more informal \"skill issue.\" But that is quite literally a terrible defense because its a infallible one. It's like if you say you don't like spinach and you're friend reply's \"oh well you just haven't had the right spinach.\" Like that's such an annoying answer because sure, at the end of the day, that person is probably right because there's a great many different ways to cook different foods and different combinations or different breeds or whatever, but you wouldn't be able to try all of them and thus won't be able to disprove it. If you have reached your opinion based on a decent numbers of encounters in different contexts, than it fine to say that it's just not for you. Even if the Witness is a great game with fascinating mechanics and a deep message behind it, it is the responsibility of the creator to make that the case for the players and not act like its the players fault if they don't enjoy it.\n\nBut like I said earlier, the Witness has many things great about it. Most of the within grid puzzles are a blast and some of the environmental puzzles are straightforward that you still have the joy of being able to think about it without having to struggle with whether or not you're looking at it right. Two great examples of this are the orchard and the keep, where it becomes very clear how it works and you can enjoy the environment without having to look at every nook and cranny. \n\nOverall, there are a lot of great things about the Witness and many things I didn't cover (Lets just ignore the audio files since this is a puzzle game at the end of the day). But it ended up being negative for me because I feel like what I perceived as poorly designed puzzles ended up severely subtracting from the game as a whole, and having to explore with no explicit direction was sometimes fun but could also be infuriating. Sometimes less is more after all. At the end of the day, the Witness doesn't really have an explicit requirement to it so you can just play it at your own pace and have fun with it. But I wouldn't recommend it if you're a bit more of a completionist like myself at times because it can make you severely question if its worth the effort in trying to complete it such that you might just brute force it or even worse look up the solution if it feels inane. It's not the kind of puzzle game that I like but I do still enjoy many of the types of puzzles the game had to offer, regardless of if you want to buy it though I don't think It's worth 40$. I would heavily recommend waiting till its on sale like at the time of this review if you want to play it.",

        "review": "Honestly, this game just wasn't for me. I know plenty of gamers whose opinion I respect have really loved this game, and at first I liked it too--mysterious abandoned island, beautiful graphics, and plenty of puzzles, what's not to like? However, after the first 300 puzzles or so (not an exaggeration by the way, there is a reported 650+ total puzzles in the game) the bloom was definitely off the rose. I don't play puzzle games just for the intrinsic enjoyment of doing puzzles; I need story, mystery, the human element. And those things simply never materialized in The Witness. I liked the idea of gradually learning how to solve completely non-verbal puzzles. And I can appreciate the theme that slowly (agonizingly slowly) emerges as the player progresses: that true spiritual growth can be encouraged by pondering unanswerable questions. Cool coo coo coo cool. Just not something I am personally interested in spending my leisure time on! \n\nUpdated to add: I was looking around to see if there was a more complete explanation for the point of this game, just because I was interested in what other people thought. The Google AI summary was quite interesting: it said that the player character was actually an android and the purpose of the island was to teach it logic and to be more human-like! I had not seen this idea anywhere else, nor did that make sense to me based on the other playthroughs I watched. And for an AI to suggest this storyline...just seemed interesting to me. Has anyone else run across this explanation??",

It's not enough to just have cool, innovative ideas in the puzzle designs, many of which are genuinely incredibly fun to solve; you have to put them together without over-indulging in meaningless repetition. It also doesn't help that much of the communication of these ideas is too abstract and not intuitive. I really enjoyed some of the areas, but it just became too much busywork by the end, without any ultimately meaningful payoff (at least for me).

        "review": "The Witness has some high highs and low lows, but overall it's a very unique experience worth a shot if it seems at all interesting to you. (It's also the second game to make me start seeing line puzzles where there are none in real life, shoutouts to TUNIC.) It's very pretty (despite some noticeable pop-in) with minimal but immersive sound design that helps the environment feel more immersive, and it helps the puzzles feel more integrated with the world you're in.\n\nThe puzzles are great. I love them. They often do a lot with a little, able to convey complex problems in few enough moving parts that you can usually keep track of them. It's also very cool discovering new concepts and realizing \"Oh, I can apply it to this other thing I saw earlier.\" In its best moments, The Witness makes each locked door a mystery waiting to be solved. Some of the mechanics are immensely creative and feel new and exciting years after the game first came out, though there are also some areas or concepts that I'm more iffy on. Significant mechanical spoilers: [spoiler]I loved the hedge maze and color puzzles, reverse-engineering the colors in the elevator is one of the coolest if most time-consuming puzzles in the game for me. The sound ones are a bit too vibe-based, which is very frustrating, especially when the gap between the sound replaying is on the longer side. Also, the light reflection ones felt a bit too much like guesswork, and were less engaging than the similar environmental obstruction or shadow-based puzzles.[/spoiler]\n\nThere are a fair amount of minor annoyances. Semi-frequently, you need to wait a while for an animation to finish to progress, and they are almost always incredibly slow. Some of them do have a reason to be slow, but it's still frustrating to wait 30 seconds for bridges to form/move/rotate/etc, for a door or gate to open, for an elevator to rise or fall, and so on, especially when it's the 10th time you've had to do so. Still, this didn't break the pace badly enough to sour the experience too much, at least for me.\n\n[b]Finally, It's worth noting that there are some accessibility concerns that crop up a decent length into your playthrough.[/b] Minor mechanical spoilers: [spoiler]There are large stretches of gameplay focused on color and pitch with no colorblindness or deafness/tone-deafness accessibility options. The pitch-focused ones sometimes include background noise or sounds that are very quick with long pauses, so if you are hard of hearing or have trouble parsing important sounds from background noise, you may struggle. Also, near the end, there are puzzles with rapid motion, repetitive flashing lights, and steadily changing colors. Finally, not as major as the other ones, but if you have trouble visualizing things and/or have an iffy working memory like I do, you'll absolutely want a second monitor or pencil and paper.[/spoiler] I get why it would be difficult if not impossible to remedy this without significantly changing the gameplay, but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth since there's no warning for mechanics that can require some players to look up a guide to keep playing, or worst-case-scenario can render the game inaccessible to people who are already many hours into the game.\n\nThe Witness is a game I'll be thinking about for a while. It isn't very often that a puzzle game (or any game) captures me like it did, and the ones that do (Outer Wilds and TUNIC come to mind) I hold in very high regard.",

        "review": "The open world hints at a story that just isn't there. This makes the unusual inclusion of audio/video logs all the more conspicuous. The media selected is quite good, but it seems in absence of The Witness really having anything to say itself. Some are favorites of mine, like The Secret of Psalm 46 from Brian Moriarty, the creator of one of my favorite games Loom (although having players [spoiler]sit and watch someone elses video/audio for an entire hour[/spoiler] should be a game design crime). To me including a clip from a Tarkovsky movie came across more like an effort to artificially elevate The Witness, than something that lends to a subtle cohesive narrative or theme. That is to say it feels shoehorned in. The fun aspects to some of the gameplay were also never good enough to counterbalance this feeling while playing. Additionally, [spoiler]the obvious grand \"A Ha\" moment that I am sure many got when they realized puzzles were hidden all around the environment, was completely lost on me because at the beginning of the game I happened to notice what looked like a line puzzle made out of a river and figured that would be something that happens later. I wasn't looking for something like that to spoil that moment for me, but it just happened unfortunately, and did have an effect on my enjoyment of the game[/spoiler].",

They are set (mostly) on panels in a beautifully rendered, colorful and serene environment. Without the open-world packaging this would be a puzzle game not worth mentioning. However, the player is free to walk around and explore as she sees fit. While this gives a feeling of exploration and adds to the bewilderment that you do not receive any introduction, this is also the games great shortcoming: it lacks a meaningful sense of direction for the player. Puzzles can be intimidating if you happen on the more sophisticated first and did not find the ones which introduce a particular mechanic before them. A lot of times you just don't get it and walk away in frustration.",

The witness is a puzzle game that might deceive you into thinking it might be a standard affair which might remind you of the mobile game called flow where you fit all lines in the square, however the game pushes this concept so incredible far, its definitely a game you have to take in one step at a time and maybe take out a piece of paper and draw out your thinking process. \nThe game is pretty open ended but everything except the swamp, the plaza, quarry and the final area are pretty manageable I think.\n\n\nyou might get stuck a lot on puzzles since this game punishes going for the intuitive answer a lot so always think outside the box and you'll progress bit by bit, but thats really what makes it so much fun.",

        "review": "I initially thought it would be subversive in some way, but it really just creates it's own genre out of the most boring parts of every game it draws from. Somehow the objectively worst game I have ever played.\n\nSeriously- if you want philosophical quotes from famous people, play getting over it. If you want subversive puzzles, play Baba is You. If you want to explore a beautiful world, go outside. If you want to learn useless information, go to school. All of these offer more purposeful experiences than The Witness, which has you walking around a hodgepodge world, pulling out your puzzle device to open up doors and connect wires; though, you really aren't connecting the wires or opening the doors, you are just doing puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles follow a formula of \"impossible to understand until you find the tutorial.\" after said tutorial, the puzzles become solvable. You then go to the next area and repeat. You are also not guaranteed to find the tutorial before you encounter the related puzzle. I guess this makes it a metroidvania, but only the backtracking parts.\n\nAt times, I felt that I wasn't really moving or interacting with a world. You can not jump, you cannot climb. This game almost feels like a two-dimensional drawing with significant parallax, since the most you can do is change your position- often through a significant amount of puzzles.\n\nThere is also really no threat that I encountered within my playtime, just walking.\n\nThe world is also supplemented by esoteric philosophical tapes littering the ground. These tapes don't add all that much to the story, and make you question why exactly you are walking around in this world when the knowledge contained within is more tied to the world outside of the game.\n\nTLDR: I didn't enjoy this game. Maybe I would have if I had not yet experienced similar twists, turns, formulas, and puzzles in other games. It really seems mundane to walk through a world that seems to want nothing more than to lob philosophy at you.",

But it eventually devolved into feeling annoyed every time you finally reach a solution after 2 agonizing hours and then feeling nothing but dread knowing that the next puzzle would be even worse. Even thinking about this game induces the same anxiety as thinking back on an abusive relationship where you were lured in by good looks and sprinklings of good times only to be made to suffer with no end in sight. Wondering how long it's been since the last time you were happy and what happened to those good times. Wondering if maybe it's your fault that you're not happy there, that maybe if you worked even harder then maybe it would be good.\n\nAlso, this game is a big, unapologetic middle finger to color blind people.",

I blame myself for watching someone else play it instead of experiencing it first hand, and while it was an interesting journey along with one youtuber, I certainly have failed my own enjoyment of discovery in this game. What can I say? I didn't even know what the game was. The Witness holds a lot of surprises. It is the game best played completely blind. Here I present my thoughts, but remember that my opinion might be shaped by someone else years ago. My criticism isn't \"pure\" and \"proper\".\n\nWhen it comes to puzzles (the main attraction) the game falls flat in some areas. While most of the problems cleverly designed to involve player's surroundings, there are just so much of them that later puzzles reliant on it become trivial. At other times - rarely - I brute-forced some pannels because although some of them involved using environment, I still couldn't understand what the game wanted from me. Even after watching guides.\nThe final area has interesting ideas such as projecting a trail from a line you would have to draw on a pannel yourself, or integrating one puzzle as a part of the other. But it is the same place where instead of presenting even more unique tasks, the challenge is to just see the puzzle itself. It spins, it blinks, it changes colors... They are not hard to solve, just hard to comprehend because of visual effects.\nSome concepts are overused in the game and become easy while others are so obscure you have to think even more out of the box to get to the solution. Tasks rarely fall inbetween. Probably The Witness wanted to make player go further an beyond thoughts they acclimate to over the course of playing, but I believe it would only work if the game had more of such demanding examples. Some panels could be taking you hours at a time to solve. It's a real pleasure if you do it them yourself, of course.\n\n[spoiler]The ending is truly unsatisfying. But unlike some people, I think it is a good thing for The Witness. It is a game about perspective in more than one way: it is about people trying to make sense of the world around them. If you listened to enough voice-journals, you know it.\nThe Witness comments on it with environmental puzzles too. Walk around a flowerfield and at some point you might see the same symbol you draw on puzzle pannels. See a stain at the top of the chimney? If you walk far enough and find some pole, it might turn into another symbol. And the game is full of stuff like that. Just as the world around us. Or, we think it is. People try to solve the world around them - find the sourse of some phenomenon, give it meaning and etc. We are very good at connections and see them everywhere. And many think that it is because we see them, it is there. And for some reason too.\nNow, imagine we got all the answers right. \"*This* is how the Universe works, *this* is why it's happening and *this* is what it's for\". Do you expect a cookie for that? When the game ends so ubruptly, erasing everything that you have done, not giving you any reward, isn't it the point of our efforts to study anything? As I see it, the game encourages you to look outside at your own life and find different perspectives on questiones you're bothered with.\n\nAnd this is where The Witness contradicts itself in a way. If you striving for 100% completion, good luck. Literally, good luck. Some of the challenges The Witness presents in terms of these environmental puzzles (where you have to find this symbol in nature around you) are buried behind layers of 3D environment. There's just so many of them, that you might spend weeks trying to seach every inch of an island. It's rich with details. Too rich. And as much it is good for two separate people have two separate experiences with the game, it also means that the game never wants to be solved and plays against the player at times. Do you know that there is one puzzle that requires you to wait almost an hour to complete it because its beginning connects to the end with an object that moves along the screen veeeeeryyyy sloooowlyyyy? AND - get this - it's one of the films you might find in a game (You also don't know how long the film will take you to watch beforehand). So, if you find it, you probably will watch it first and MAYBE notice that there's a part of a puzzle. Then you will start searching for places where this part might fit and then you will have to watch this film AGAIN to finish the puzzle. This is terrible. [/spoiler]\n\nFor a game that inspires curiosity, The Witness' secrets are so unbelievably time consuming, that it undermines the whole message of the game. At the same time its implementation makes perfect sense. Just hearing what different people have to say on topics of religion, culture, art and science makes you reflect on world around you. Maybe, The Witness is not the game that asks to be completed in any way, just as you can't complete life. Maybe you really just need to close it and go outside.\n\nI recommend playing The WItness. I don't recommend finishing it.",

        "review": "So right off the bat, my no recommendation isn't exactly true. Just to get this out of the way, here's my positives. if you are the kind of player who loves puzzles and working them out, and I mean LOVE puzzles, this game is for you. Granted, the entire game is line puzzles, but there is enough variety that you can keep your brain working harder and harder as the game goes on. Additionally, if you love beautiful and colorful environments, you'll also love this game. With that out of the way, here's why I wouldn't really recommend this for the average player. This game has a lot of line puzzles, and I mean A LOT. If you don't thing you can play through about 10 hours or so of just line puzzles with some variation here and there, you probably shouldn't pick this one up unless its on sale. Granted, if you're here looking at a puzzle game then you're probably all on board for that! What's really my turn off is spoilers though: [spoiler] To start out with positive spoilers, I absolutely LOVE the obelisk puzzles! I accidently discovered one of the lines in the world while exploring the town, and i fell in love with it. I think I spent more of my down time looking for lines around the world than anything. I don't know why, but this alone was what kept me playing through to the end despite my struggles. On with the negatives though,  a lot of the endgame areas are absolutely BRUTAL with gimmicks that will probably take you an hour just to understand and then make you sit on a single puzzle for another hour. Specifically, there is a block gimmick where you are shown specific Tetris-like blocks and you must fill in the puzzle accordingly. This is tough on its own, but when it is combined with some of the game's even more tricky gimmicks it gets to the point where you cannot complete the game unless you are a line puzzle god I personally had to look up some solutions around the end of the game due to the nature of these puzzles just frying my brain. As you can tell by my play time, I absolutely breezed through the beginning areas by my own without problem, but the endgame areas such as the Mountain and Quarry are just insane. Additionally, there is a completely optional challenge run which is absolutely insane with the timing. I have only seen a few legitimate runs through it, others use game pause shenanigans to stop the in-game timer so they can solve each puzzle. It is optional though so I can't really knock the game too hard for that. [/spoiler]",

The first puzzle in each area serves as a brilliant tutorial for the mechanic being introduced in the area. Sometimes it takes awhile to see the solutions and it'll be a little frustrating sometimes but trust me, keep exploring until you find a puzzle that makes sense, and soon you will be off on a mind-bending journey of discovery, perspective, and skilled observation. This game will make you look at it like you've never looked at anything before. And then, if you do the mechanical transferrence thing where you start to think of what if you could apply video game mechanics to other games, or real life, and this game will make you look at the world more carefully and maybe even see things you hadn't before.",

However, it's not TOO complicated, unlike some of the brain busting puzzles. This game's pretty fun, using a simple mechanic (drawing a continuous line on a grid) and twisting it to hell and back. The environments are pretty too, and if you  look closely, you may see something interesting... Anyways, if you're a puzzle fan, try this one out. Just don't go too far down the rabbithole, alright? You don't need to watch the hour long philosophy videos for the achievements. No one should be subjected to that.",

All puzzle mechanics are taught through gameplay rather than tutorials letting you learn about the mechanics through exploring. The openness of the game also lets you walk away from a tricky puzzle to go do something else and learn more about the game in the process. This game may not be for everybody as it is very tricky and can be quite slow (since its a pure puzzle game), however it is the greatest puzzle game I have ever played and a unique experience everybody should try.",

Each thing, each person that happen to exist within my gaze are nothing more than an unsolvable puzzle. Maybe the angle is wrong, maybe I have to move something around?\n\nThe clouds are full of puzzles. The cracks in the sidewalk must connect to a circle somewhere. \nI look into my child's eye. I must click the circle. The puzzle must be solved.\n\nAs a professional witness myself, I can say that this game is an apt depiction of what it's like to have eyes. \nAs a bonus, the game also allows you to have ears. \n\nI go on a walk to try to take my mind off of things. A leaf falls from a tree and lands in the lake, resting calmly on the surface of the water. There is still work to be done here. \n\nI hear birds chirping around me, dogs barking. The gravel shifts beneath my feet with each step. \nMaybe if I time it right, I can get a puzzle with that kid's ball he's kicking around. \n\nHopscotch. Tic-tac-toe. Drawings on the sidewalk of unknowable creatures. I see a circle.\nI water my plants. An unripe tomato on a vine. The way the sun lines with with the top of the trellis.\nMy eyes burn. Maybe this new dot in my vision is part of a secret puzzle.\n\nI can't listen to classical music anymore. Travelling is hard. The world beneath a plane is just more puzzles.\nIf I go to a hotel, I'll just wake up again. I need to solve the puzzles first. I can't take the elevator either yet.\nIt's easier to just stay home instead. Maybe I should replay The Witness again.",

        "review": "Let me start by saying that I'm a big puzzle connoisseur. I've played many puzzle games in the past and that is almost exclusively what I have been playing recently. I was very excited about The Witness because it had great reviews and people saying that they wish they could erase their memories to play it all over again. When I jumped into the game I was greeted with the first simple puzzles that are about drawing lines on a grid. That 'grid drawing' concept follows you around throughout the whole game and seemed extremely easy to follow at first but becomes more and more complex with new rules being added as you go.\n\nRight after leaving the starting area, you are thrown into an open world environment that is actively working against you (at least that's how it felt to me). There are no markers indicating where you should go or what you should do next or how to continue and/or what the goal of the game actually is. You are completely on your own. As I mentioned before, the grid drawing becomes more complex as you continue but since there are no guidelines telling you where to go, it is easy to end up in an area with crazy puzzles and rules that you haven't even learned the basics for yet. Even if you manage to find the 'tutorial' puzzles, there are no directions as to how you can solve them. For example, the grid can contain a symbol that indicates that you must ignore/break another rule within the same puzzle. If you know the game, this might sound easy to you but if you have no idea what it means and you're completely new, this sort of 'tutorial' is not helpful at all and is quite frustrating to deal with (if you're lucky enough to find the 'tutorial' puzzle in the first place).\n\nI am not the type to look up answers to games either because I want to find the solution myself but did find myself having to look up the rules to certain puzzles simply because I didn't understand what was required of me. \n\nThe most frustrating thing that made me decide not to continue with the game was when I worked my way through a castle with 4 hedge mazes. Up until that point, every single puzzle was based off visual clues. You had to see in order to decide how a puzzle was to be solved. The third maze had audio clues that would tell you where to go. I usually listen to my music while playing solo puzzle games or have my headphones off so I was stuck at this puzzle for 40-50 minutes before I gave up and decided to find a guide, JUST to realize that I had to hear my way through the maze. Eventually I felt more frustration than satisfaction so I have decided to quit altogether. \n\nI don't like giving negative reviews and do was to end by saying that everyone should make up their own mind. Most people seem to like this game which I completely respect and understand. For the puzzles that I understood, I really enjoyed myself and loved the difficulty progression. For the puzzles that didn't make sense to me, I hated just how stuck I felt without knowing where I might be able to find the answer. \n\nAll in all, while I didn't like 'The Witness' myself, I do recommend trying it out and experiencing it for yourself.",

But then after a few cycles only the most tedious and obnoxious puzzles were left, including the whole section that I could not possibly have beaten due to not being able to differentiate bird chirp tones. Rather than consulting guides and walkthroughs, I just left with good memories about those first 10 hours.",

Amazing graphics, intuitive progression with some exceptions.\n\nSome things that I didn't like too much I put in a spoiler.\n[spoiler]I reached the end, then I went back and continued and activated the remaining lasers. But until this point, I somehow haven't found ANY environmental puzzle. When I found the first one, I was astonished, but then when I started looking for the other ones, the process became really tedious. Although the world isn't huge, I wish there was a way to fast travel to specific locations.\nThe puzzle that required about an hour to wait for the solar eclipse, was just a bad game design. I immediately figured out what to do by fast forwarding the video to the end, so there was no challenge in it, it was just a waste of time.\n[/spoiler]",

Very little is forced on you, but you get a vague notion of a world that just sort of froze in time, and you can walk about and explore those ruins through puzzles. I have to warn you, the game doesn't tell you how to solve them. You have to build a set of rules for each type of puzzle that you encounter, and those rules slowly get refined through your being forced to adapt. There are a few puzzles that I have had to brute force, but later I would find the answer in plain sight. Be patient with this one, it's worth it!",

I would call it similar to \r\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/]Outer Wilds[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/201420/Toki_Tori_2/]Toki Tori 2+[/url] because knowledge is power. If you know what a puzzle looks like then you can find and solve them. Also the ways in which you interact with the world are fairly limited. I love it.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I don't really like are the voice clips. I don't feel like they add anything to the experience.",

        "review": "I dislike this game.\r\n\r\n[h3]In short:[/h3]\r\nAt first I was charmed by the environment and the puzzles. Then I realized that this game tries really hard to be something intellectual and philosophical, something that gives no reason to anything existing in this world. \"Think about it yourself\", or something like that. Usually games reward exploration and progression with lore and discoveries. Not in this one. The ending sucked too.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h3]Long rant:[/h3]\r\n\r\n[u]The puzzles:[/u]\r\nThe puzzles seemed quite cool at the start. A very unique concept which builds on itself in new and original ways. At the start, the way the puzzles are introduced is quite simple and they get a little more complicated as it goes on, which made sense.\r\nHowever, there is no textual explanation, so when you try a puzzle and accidentally get it correct, you will never know why. Building upon that to more complicated puzzles then becomes impossible if you don't understand the logic.\r\nThe good thing is the feedback when you get a puzzle wrong. This makes it easier to find the fault in your solution and adjust it accordingly. For me personally, this never worked with the [spoiler]Tetris puzzles[/spoiler]. I really thought I would have part of the puzzle correct, only for it to blink red and confuse me to no end. I ended up googling this specific puzzle type because I just couldn't be bothered anymore.\r\nAlso, I hated the [spoiler]sound puzzles[/spoiler]. It tries to overwhelm you just by adding chaos (which is lame btw), which it very much did for me, to the point where there was no logical explanation which [spoiler]sound[/spoiler] I needed to be working with. Stupid.\r\n\r\n[u]The environment:[/u]\r\nThis is what initially drew me in about this game. The world is interesting, incredibly beautiful and fun to discover. There are \"secrets\" everywhere. The sound effects are soothing and really draw you into the world. I found it fun to run around and discover places I hadn't been to. The colors were stunning and it's interesting trying to discover some sort of story about all of it.\r\n\r\n[u]The lore?[/u]\r\nAt first I was intrigued by the environment, why it was shaped this way, what it was trying to tell me. Soon I realized that it was a very disappointing story, [spoiler]tangled in philosophy.[/spoiler] I can think of something myself or fill in the gaps, in which case it could be anything, which I just don't like. Especially the ending makes it ten times worse, if not a hundred times. [spoiler] It uses the same thing a lot of tv shows and stories use that I just don't like; \"it was all a dream/fake lol. this was all for nothing\"[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[u]In the end...[/u]\r\nThis game just feels like it could've been so much more, but, I don't know, because it wanted to be unique or different, it has chosen a very specific route and approach that is just not for everyone. [spoiler] I really feel like I wasted a lot of time just watching some guy getting his candle blown out. Like, what?[/spoiler] Maybe there is something very profound about it that I just didn't get. Maybe this just isn't my kind of game. I just got frustrated with it and wanted it to end asap.\r\n\r\nThere are some really cool mechanics in here and some interesting environmental clues to a story, it's just, not enough. The frustration with stupid puzzles and lack of guidance and lore is just overwhelming for me to recommend it to anyone. I do not recommend it. It feels like a frustrating waste of time.",

Very straight forward puzzles, a logical game flow and the experience is great. But a few hours in, the fact that it's an open world starts working against you. You will encounter puzzles to which you probably haven't been introduced yet before and have no real means of solving or understanding the rules without finding the tutorial puzzles of that type first. And even if you do find the correct starting point for a certain type of puzzle, once you think you understand the rules, the rules are sometimes changed halfway through with barely any indication that they did. So everything you thought you knew can be thrown out of the window and you're beginning from scratch again.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind sitting on the same puzzle for a long time trying to figure it out, this game might be for you. I am not that person. I am a casual gamer. I don't have the patience to spend an hour per puzzle and then probably end up either brute-forcing my way to finding the logic or playing the game alongside YouTube tutorials. And that just sucks the fun out of it completely if you are not a hardcore puzzler and more of casual player. \r\n\r\nReally wish there were any optional hints/explanation in the game to ease you into the puzzles or give you a nudge if you're stuck. I am just not that hardcore of a puzzle gamer to want to invest a lot of time in individual puzzles and it just got increasingly frustrating more than anything else if I couldn't understand the logic behind a puzzle. I might still complete the game for the sake of seeing where the story is going, but it will probably be through walkthrough videos more than anything, which is a shame.",

You must assume everything has a purpose, everything is designed, and if you are stuck, its intentional.\nThis game is challenging, but not just in the conventional puzzle sense. The witness does not necessarily put the tools you need to solve the puzzles in your hands. Instead, you must learn what the tools are, and how they are intended to be used. In my opinion, that is the genius of this game. However, this can create a disconnect between the player and the puzzles as, at some points, if you are not confident with the tools, it can feel like trying to fit a square peg into round hole. That being said, while I may have encountered said challenge, I did not see it to be a barrier to my enjoyment of the game; not at all.\n\nThe witness, in a way, could be considered a game of trust. This goes back to that pretentiousness I mentioned at the beginning; when I played this game, I refused to attribute my lack of understanding to the games lack of guidance. I believe this is because whatever teaching the game did felt like a mere courtesy. Near the beginning of the game, you are introduced to a puzzle that uses multiple mechanics you have not been introduced to yet. Most players assume this puzzle is intended to be skipped, and while this may be practically true, I argue that intention need not be considered here. That is because if you would like to sit around for 30 minutes or more and brute force this puzzle, you can. \nI believe this shows the nature of The Witness; not just a game with challenges to overcome, but a game that is conceptually, from the ground up and in it's entirety, a challenge within of itself. This makes more sense when considering that there are puzzles in this game that you can not be expected to solve without the assistance of pen and paper, and others that just seem without regard for the player. And that's why I love this game. It REFUSES to meet you where you are at, yet is never ONCE intentionally vague (I'm looking at you, Destiny 2). As a completionist, the puzzles made me feel clever, but the game made me feel like a champion.",

Buy it for your friends. You come away feeling like you've conquered something massive and just been floored by (and have really impressed yourself) with making it through each section.\n\nAlso: this is a masterclass on language. It teaches you syntax, context, and how to string various elements from different puzzles together into compound sentences, and in some cases, like this sentence, those strings of concepts become incredibly interdependent on each moving part.",

From the very first moments, as you step onto the mysterious and beautifully crafted island, the game captivates with its stunning aesthetics and meticulously designed structure. Every corner of the island hides unique puzzles that demand not only logical thinking but also keen observation and patience.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of The Witness is the freedom it offers in exploration. You are not led by the hand – instead, you independently uncover the rules governing the game world and seek out solutions. Each puzzle presents a genuine challenge, providing immense satisfaction upon finding the correct answer.\n\nThe game is not just a test of intelligence but also a philosophical journey. Subtle hints and hidden narrative elements prompt reflection on perception, knowledge, and consciousness. The Witness is not just a game; it is an experience that lingers in the memory long after the final puzzle is solved.\n\nJonathan Blow and his team have crafted a masterpiece that stands out among other puzzle games. I highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a truly challenging and intellectually stimulating experience. The Witness is a true gem in the world of video games.",

        "review": "Okay. Now, allow me to review one of the best puzzle game I ever played which stands side by side with Portal 2. In fact, you know what? It is the best game I ever played. Now onto the game. The Witness started with a very basic introduction to the format of the puzzle which is to connect a dot to the other dot across a line. That's it. The concept is very easy to grasp especially for puzzle lovers. But then as you progress through the game, it started introducing new mechanics within the 'connect the dot' gameplay, which then it started to hit you: this game is not as easy as it does several minutes ago. But, the pure genius behind The Witness is that it educates us on the puzzle solution without using any single word or narrative. It lets our brain works on itself and by the time we figured it all out, we started to realize that our brain has been subconciously rewired by it. We leveled up not by EXP point or gold, but by our own understanding of the game. The currency of the game is knowledge. Truly one of the best cerebral journey in gaming ever. And discovering how all the puzzles are interconnected with each other within the small island it's located in is such an amazing revelation, and it shows how much love the developer puts during the creation of it. Don't get me started on the environmental puzzles. Holy cow, if that ain't one of the most unique and magical puzzles gameplay ever existed, I don't even know what is. A pure, authentic puzzle lovers would never miss out on this game. And if you know some puzzle lovers who still haven't discovered it, let them know. Because they are in for a wild ride. And let them be the witness. (no pun intended)\n\n10/10 will keep searching for the environmental puzzles in my own hometown (if you know what I mean)",

        "review": "A very simplistic yet kind of addicting puzzle game. Mechanics are simple, if you see a circle followed by a line, you just drag your cursor along the line to its end. As you go along the game, the puzzles go from simple mazes to adding more and more elements one after the other and then combining them all, making the ending sections very challenging.\nAdded to the “main areas” are a lot of environmental puzzles where areas in the environment line up in a way that creates a new maze you have to solve. In total there are 523 normal and 135 environmental puzzles, so this game will take you quite a while to actually beat everything. But if you’re not into having a completed save file, you can also just stick to the main areas and see the ending without having to go out of your way to look for all the collectibles.\nThere are also a whole lot of audio logs scattered around the world which are beautifully narrated, but I just didn’t have the drive to look for and listen to all of them, but there seems to be some bigger meaning and philosophy hidden throughout the entire thing.\nIf I had to give one big critique, it’s this game’s non-linearity. Yes, it makes exploring the island a whole lot more fun, you’re basically given complete access after beating the Entry Area, but you’ll more often then not stumble into a puzzle you just won’t be able to solve at that stage. The easier areas are close to the starting point but even then, there are no worded explanations to how puzzle elements work and on some you’re stuck with trial and error until something works and then you have to go back to figure out why. It kind of drove the fun out of things for me, which is why I stuck to spoiler free walkthroughs that guided me through all the areas in increasing difficulty which I think is the way to go.\nOverall, if you’ve got a thing for maze puzzles and a couple dozen hours to spare then this is a definite recommendation.\n\n[u]Achievements[/u]\nThere are only 2 achievements in the entire game, and both are relatively straightforward. The first one just requires you to beat the game by finishing all the main areas and the ending section. The second one is a bit trickier. After beating the game for the first time you unlock The Challenge which is basically a timed gauntlet of multiple randomly generated puzzles using all the elements used throughout the game. This can be quite tough, and it personally took me about 2 hours until I finally beat it even though I was only off by a couple of seconds. Beating this does feel very satisfying tho. So, even if you’re not the best at the maze puzzles, it’s not a hard 100%",

There's no rush, no stress, you can't die, and AFAIK you can't really paint yourself into a corner either.\n\nIt also has remarkably polished game physics, which you won't notice due to the minimalist controls (you can basically just walk), but no news is good news here: it's not your average glitchy custom 3D engine from the low-poly era.\n\nCons:\n\n- A bit sluggish: my 2-core i5 notebook almost chokes on it with all the gfx set to lowest. Fortunately, it still looks gorgeous, due to its lush, vivid, colorful design.\n\n- The game was meant to be 100% explored and 0% explained (with no auxiliary or meta narrative, no tutorials, no hints etc.), but this means that e.g. the effect, or even the very purpose of, some puzzles (esp. those optional yellow/orange ones scattered all across the map) are really just frustrating to figure out, rather than mysterious and exciting.\n\n- [!!! SPOILER !!!] Many stunning, intriguing creative elements of the world serve no purpose whatsoever, they are mere embellishments (even otherwise interactive objects like the audio tapes and secret puzzles -- which are just weirdly off-topic and tedious spiritual/philosophical monologues). They do reinforce the unique vibe, but still: what a sorely missed opportunity!",

        "review": "Review Summary: Overall it is a good game and is worthwhile if you're really interested in obtuse puzzles, simple open world exploration, and philosophy, but if not I can't really recommend it. Don't expect a story or in game rewards outside of a sense of achievement. It has a serious issue with causing motion sickness even if you don't normally experience it with games. Also, be careful if you are epileptic, some portions will likely cause problems for you.\n\n-------------------\n\nI like the game, the visuals are overall great, and can be great if you're interested in it, but there are some severe issues. It isn't a bad game, but don't go in expecting it to be a cake walk, and don't go in expecting great rewards for completing stuff outside of a sense of achievement. Also, don't go in expecting a story, the closest thing to that in the game are the various audio recordings of philosophical or poetic quotes and the very light environmental storytelling, with it being more of an experience based game than a story one.\n\nOne big thing that I should mention is that if you are hard of hearing or deaf, there is an entire section that will likely be pretty much impossible to get through without a walk through, and if you are epileptic there are certain parts which will be pretty dangerous for you, particularly in the final portion of the game.\n\nIts a decently interesting world to explore, with each area being visually unique with a ton of puzzles, though these puzzles can get extremely infuriating at points due to them being needlessly obtuse or being based around some function that is poorly taught to the player. \n\nThe biggest issue is that it seems like it was designed to cause you to experience motion sickness. I've never experienced that issue with any game before. 2 of the 3 main causes can be fixed, the FOV and the lack of reticle, yet the motion blur is still pretty nauseating. Also, there are some portions such as the boat as well as some puzzles in the final area which really cause this issue to get a lot worse when doing them. Again, I have never before experienced motion sickness from a game before this, and it got pretty bad at points even after fixing the two issues I mentioned.",

        "review": "Full disclosure: I didn't finish the game. I wanted to like The Witness when I started, but I can't recommend it. \r\n\r\nIn my mind, the only thing going for it is the visuals. It's stylized and gorgeous. \r\n\r\nIf there's a narrative, I have no idea what it is. I found a few audio logs on the ground that had random quotes from historical figures. Maybe it's building to some grand philosophical point? I'm sure it's loaded with environmental storytelling. 10 hours in though, I had no idea where I was there or why I should care. Unlike games like Portal or the Talos Principle, there was just zero intrigue. It didn't feel like the game *wanted* me to care.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is a slog. The core mechanic puzzle mechanic is staring at a board and trying to draw connections between points. Along the way, various rules are introduced to make this more complicated. Again, I only made it 10 hrs in. Maybe the variety improves (many other reviews are closer to 50 hrs). But so far, this is the only mechanic. The rules they introduce to complicate this mechanic aren't interesting. They are either obvious, or obscure to the point where you succeed by pure trial and error. You sometimes get feedback about which rules were violated when you fail a puzzle, but rarely *how* the rule was violated. Communication of the the \"how I failed\" part is pretty critical to learning. But even when the rules make sense and you feel accomplished for learning/using them, they get monotonous quickly.\r\n\r\nThe environmental visuals also factor into the puzzles. I like this idea, since it breaks up the monotony of staring at a grid. These sometimes feel great. Other times, they are punishingly obscure. Once you learn what an environment cue means, the game degrades into the modern equivalent of pixel hunting. You need to run around and find the very specific spot/angle you need to to solve the puzzle from. Even though they are interesting at times, they often lead to even more monotony.\r\n\r\n Some puzzles have the infuriating property of deactivating when you fail to solve them. This isn't a \"branching path\" kind of thing. When a puzzle deactivates, you just need to go back and re-solve the previous puzzle. Your solution is still shown on the previous puzzle. So, you just redraw the lines and go back to the puzzle you were actually trying to solve. It does nothing but waste your time. Some puzzles do this, others don't. It's a minor issue, but a baffling game design decision. It adds nothing but (are you excited for the word of the day yet ?) just even more monotony. \r\n\r\nSkill issue? Maybe. Maybe these puzzles aren't for me. But if I wanted to stare at grid for hours, I could buy a Sudoku book and go to the park. I could do that for a lot less than the outrageous $40 dollars they're still (in 2024) charge for this game. The book might not have a payoff at the end, but I know it won't try to serve me some \"deep and profound\" pseudo-philosophical point from a random dev who made a poorly-designed puzzle game",

I play in almost every two years which is ample time for me to forget enough about it to experience most of the game once again. Each time I play the game, I think I am able to discover something or somewhere new.\nMy brother made me play the game and then I started seeing lines, like water dripping down on my shower cabin, everywhere in my daily life and still do. I love solving puzzles with complex solutions and this game teaches you the puzzles itself but there are some points you may stuck and feel like you won't be ever be able to have this eureka moment but you do and it feels great! \nIf you are into taking your time, thinking deep and relaxing, I do recommend Witness.",

There seems to be some kind of overarching story to the game, but it feels so abstract that it lost my interest. However, it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game, which mainly stemmed from just doing the puzzles.\n\nI loved the open-world aspect, where if I got stuck on a certain puzzle, I could just take a break and head somewhere else for a bit, then come back for my revenge against that one silly square boy who had made me pull out my brain cells just hours before. Only to somehow get a new perspective on it with a fresh mind and solve it, making me feel as though I had just experienced an eureka moment without even realizing I had actually been thinking it over the whole time. Even though I wasn't even on that puzzle anymore.",

        "review": "The game starts off simple, but because it's open world - you can accidentally walk into a puzzle that you're not supposed to know how to solve yet and just bang your head against it until you give up. The game doesn't have a map, so you really need to remember where everything is, which is overwhelming. Solving these puzzles doesn't feel rewarding. Requires a pretty high IQ to overcome, I had to Google my way through the last 30-40% of the game because I've felt fed up banging my head against a wall trying to figure out rules of some puzzles, because they're never explained. The game wants you to just figure them out. And after all that - the ending is extremely disappointing. None of it was worth it. If you really love puzzles - prepare pen and paper, set aside about 50 hours and maybe you'll beat the game without a guide. But like I said, even then the lore and the ending is not worth the trouble at all. Huge disappointment. 4/10",

You complete ridiculously rewarding spatial reasoning puzzles - basically, figuring out \"where do I draw the line\" - that were clearly created with care and insight, and every so often you encounter some philosophical musings. No more complicated than that - nor does it need to be. Have fun!",

I think this is a video game of that.\r\nI'm embarrassed it took me so long to catch on, but it boils the frog slowly and lulls you into thinking it's being clever.\r\nIt didn't realise this was the case until I found myself \"solving\" a \"puzzle\" by literally standing locked in place, listening to an annoyingly pretentious narrator talking about how he used to work at radio shack and realising I would have to stand there for about an hour of him doing this until the moment the \"puzzle's\" solution became valid.\r\nAt that moment I was like \"Oh... I'm the butt of the joke. I'm being f***ed with,\" and I stopped the puzzle, closed the game, and realised I'd been the butt of the joke for over 50 hours.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I should be mad at the game for messing with me or if I should respect it for doing such a good job. Either way, I feel stupid for letting myself be duped. Kind of that feeling you get when you're stuck on a puzzle for a long time and then notice something super obvious that makes it trivial, but on a huge scale.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wouldn't recommend playing this game. Zero stars, or maybe five stars.",

This game is perfect for someone who loves to tackle hard problems. It takes patience and perseverance. It's not a game about just reaching the end, but truly about the journey and discovery you personally experience along the way.\n\nI still have many puzzles left to solve at the time of this review, and I am looking forward to them :)",

        "review": "[i]The Witness[/i] is a fantastic game; I would really have no qualms about ending the review there. It uses a beautiful mesh of realism and painterly impressionism to make a beautiful world whose sense of exploration and wonder is perfectly in line with the great litany of things to be found, from a great many little secret and clever detail which reward the careful eye, to the hundreds of line puzzles throughout. \n\nDespite the quantity of the puzzles throughout, almost each and every one of them serves some purpose. From teaching you a mechanical consequence to simply opening a door, each puzzle's completion is its own reward, bringing you step by step closer to enlightenment.\nl\nI'm being vague on purpose because as a puzzle game - a [u]very, very good[/u] puzzle game -  [i]The Witness[/i]' every moment is that of beautiful, resonant revelation between utterly brain-bending trials. A lesser game would provide hints, background music, anything to latch onto, but [i]The Witness[/i] leaves you completely and utterly to your own devices and is such very much susceptible to being spoiled and very much is best experienced as blind as can be. I'm going to talk about a few significant spoilers, which I'll black out for the sake of the prospective [i]Witness[/i] player. Enjoy!\n\nHowever, it's not perfect; I have a few gripes, really the tiniest of nitpicks on what was otherwise an amazing game I could happily recommend to any puzzle fan.\n\n[olist]\n[*]When you have a puzzle selected, there's often something dinging. Either the beginning circle or the endpoints of the puzzle - which the game elegantly and wordlessly teaches the importance of to the player - are constantly blinking, with a visual and auditory cue. For a game that relishes in giving you the time and mental space to think things out, a tiny mistake like this really feels like a bullet.\n\n[*]Some puzzles, upon failure, deactivate. This makes it so you have to go back and re-enter the solution (which is typically pretty easy to remember but [i]does[/i] disappear as you re-interact with a given puzzle panel) to the previous panel in a sequence - a feature which is never telegraphed to the player (though even if it was it would be just as unpleasant). [i]The Witness[/i] as a game, other than this one quirk, can really pride itself on its terseness of concept so again it is a shame to see something like this bubble up through. Solving a puzzle in this game is a communication of understanding, having to repeat it again mindlessly in some arbitrary rite of passage to retry the current puzzle is, even if a very short inconvenience when it does happen, a baffling blunder from a game like this.\n\n[*]There shouldn't be a sprint button. The obvious response is [i]\"Well, why don't you just not sprint?[/i] but at the end of the day the purpose of a system is what it does; and a sprint, naturally, encourages sprinting. At least to me, something like that communicates a lack of trust in the game environment to a) be beautiful and b) communicate priorities and paths to the player. \n\nThe obvious exception to this is [spoiler]the challenge (which is fantastic by the way; I'm not sure I've ever truly comprehended the heart-stopping terror of [i]In the Hall of the Mountain King[/i] until I played this game), to the point that I'm convinced that a sprint was added with the express purpose of being used in the challenge, just kind of being this odd vestigial growth for the rest of the game during which you, very notably, never need to and shouldn't move fast. Especially for noticing the puzzles hidden in the map; the mix of boredom and wonder of an aimless walk throughout the island is very sufficient fuel to find a very large chunk of these.[/spoiler]\n\nEspecially given the extra shortcuts and movement options the game grants you pretty early on and only expands on as you progress, having a sprint on top of that just feels overkill to me.\n\n[*][spoiler]Obtaining the secret ending, the one with the hotel and the credits and the real-life video, is a bit odd. I'm going to have to talk a lot more about the game a bit more holistically to describe what I mean.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler][i]The Witness[/i], to me, feels like an allegory for the Buddhist concept of enlightenment. As the game approaches its end and you enter the mountain which has been ominously looming over the island and attracting the lights of lasers, you begin to get the sense that this is all a test of sorts. A few nuggets that hint toward this appear throughout the island; recurring symbols, sketches of buildings and puzzles, but here it goes mask-off. Various security monitors show parts of the island, and malfunctioning and rejected puzzles are strewn about the various laboratory-like rooms of the mountain. And yet even these lead you deeper and deeper down the mountain, culminating in an elevator chamber which flies you to the beginning of the game, losing all your control as all your puzzles become undone and culminating in the game itself closing. When you re-open the game you are as you would be if you had never played the game at all, at the start of the very first hallway with no progress in the island to speak of.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]This to me feels like a death and rebirth of the player character. Though the puzzles are in the same deactivated state as they were when you first downloaded the game, your knowledge and intuition of the game persists; if you started from scratch you would absolutely finish far quicker than your first attempt. However, the secret ending is not about progressing; rather it is about finding an environmental puzzle using the sun - the most significant circle in the game, one which looms over you for the entire time - thus activating a hotel lounge, which a straight walk forward through brings you to the secret ending. In this secret ending a human wakes up from some kind of virtual simulation and walks around the real studio in which [i]The Witness[/i] was developed, utterly transfixed on patterns of lines and circles. This feeling was completely and utterly relatable, that tiny worm that [i]The Witness[/i] grows in your brain for seeing circles connected to lines very well might be the game's most profound export.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]However, the secret ending does not follow this exact sequence.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]What I believe is the intended route to the secret ending revolves around a room, hidden behind activating all 11 lasers (of which only 7 of one's own choice are required to beat the game) and the optional challenge (which, amidst all this negative babble, I feel inclined to mention again is AMAZING). In this room is a puzzle solution which, when put into a certain panel in the starting section, re-seals the door making the sun puzzle, previously blocked off by forward progression, once again possible. I realize this is the tiniest of nitpicks, but the whole beauty of the secret ending, to me, [i]is[/i] that voluntary relinquishing of all puzzle progress, [i]is[/i] that metaphorical acceptance of one's own death to reach enlightenment! Being able to get this ending while having all your pretty puzzle panels lit up, while still indulging oneself in the [i]samsara[/i] of the game world, feels so thematically incoherent to me! Of course, this is the most minute of nitpicks, but finding flaws in a game as pleasant and absorbing in this is like finding needles in a haystack, exclusively by having them prick your fingers.[/spoiler]\n[/olist]\n\nIf you read through all that, thank you! I have not tried to articulate my thoughts about [i]The Witness[/i] very much at all, so actually putting the experience of this game that has utterly entranced me is always nice - like a release valve in my brain. I do want to revisit it someday, but for now I think I've earned a break.\n\nIf you just scrolled to the bottom and haven't played it, go away!! Play [i]The Witness[/i]!!",

I came back to it and sat down to play it through, and things went very well from there. The Witness is a puzzle game that really stretches your mind to its limits, stacking more and more rules onto its mechanics and throwing in creative twists to keep your mental gears running at maximum. Getting the final achievement was tough, but practice is all it takes. Great brain exercises, great experience.",

The interaction between the constantly evolving grid rules and the environment is amazing, the two end areas were a ton of fun (besides the dumb flashing color screens). I can't describe how high the highs of this game are. The challenge was one of the most fun things in a puzzle game I've played.\n\nLike all puzzle games, it has stinkers. Puzzles that either suck, or just didn't click with me. Color theory land sucks (how does magenta + magenta = white?). The ship vault was one of the most overdesigned puzzles I've ever seen, and ridiculous logical leaps have to be made. The way to access the entire secret area is just cruel, especially considering how obvious it is that the area exists, and considering how [spoiler]you can't know that some environmental puzzles and the 4th paper are there[/spoiler].\n\nI don't agree with the people that say this game has too many puzzles, that the grid puzzles all feel the same and get old, that it's just trying to waste your time, or that it's pretentious (I don't even understand what half the crap means and I don't care). But, I will respect that games don't click with everybody, players can miss one thing and be confused the whole time, sometimes players have less patience or less experience with certain types of games.\n\nI almost completely enjoyed my time with this game, and even that GDC talk made me smile (and the you know what with it - i hated its existence, but it's kinda funny i guess).\n\nThe reason for the negative review:\n\nBut again, I will not respect a game that does not make itself accessible to as many players as it can. Colorblind options and options for those that are deaf or hard of hearing (or just not making puzzles based on those things)? An epilepsy warning? Controller support? Audio options? I don't understand how this was published without these things.",

No jumping, climbing, etc, just wishing your character could raise their foot six inches off the ground at times.\n\nThe environmental story telling isn't interesting either because the game doesn't appear to have a story, just themes and random details everywhere.\n\nSome people will love this game, but I feel like getting a big book of line puzzles would be more interesting than placing them in a game world. So much more could have been done with the mechanic but they went for wide not deep in game design terms.",

I just solved half of the puzzles in one area and forced to move on to the others. I have no shame cheating so I went to look up for some guidelines for helps lol. Although is definitely not idea, I still enjoy this game a lot after learning the mechanism of it and could really started to invest into these beautiful puzzles. The takeaway is puzzles are EVERYWHERE...the path you took. the direction you choose, the orders of area, the angles to look at things.... But the sense of achievement is huge afterward!",

But in this, you get a pseudo-deep \"game\" that pretends to be something more than it is. This game actually leaked from east Kazakhstan as a torture method that had a 100% success rate for interrogation. I think if I had the choice to play this game again or fight 10 Armenian chimpanzees and 20 Chinese midgets I'd choose the latter. I think I'd rather brush my teeth with liquid shit for 13 hours straight than play this game. I think I'd rather eat 10 twix bars from an iguanas ass than play this game again. I think I'd rather play 'Goobies' for 72 hours straight than play this game. Don't play this game if your frontal lobe is intact and you want to keep it that way. I'm a changed man now. I feel... touched... sexually... mentally... goobies... (-‿◦☀) arigatogozaimasu for reading review byeeeeee 💋💋💋",

        "review": "i first played this game when i was 16 and, despite having loved puzzle games ever since i could remember, this game made me fall in love with these games in a whole new way. this game is the ultimate show-don't-tell masterpiece, and the marrying of simplicity with complexity is done in such a beautiful way that it makes Myst look like a baby's binky.\n\nwhat is really incredible about this game is how the environment and the individual \"puzzle games\" are combined and played with in really thoughtful and mind-bending ways. nothing feels like a gimmick; everything feels inventive and creative to the point that every single challenge gives you an incredible feeling when you find the solution.\n\nhowever, it is really, really difficult. i pride myself on never, ever looking up a guide/walkthrough to playing any puzzle game that i start. for this game, i hope you're ready to test your patience-- i stopped playing about halfway through and i didn't pick up this game again until 6 years later, when i was 22, stopping again about 3/4 of the way through.\n\nnow, at 24, i am just about to complete the (base) game, save for all of the environmental puzzles (which i'm still about 1/2 through). these puzzles are probably the most awe inspiring part of the game-- they mirror the mini puzzle games but in your visual perspective of the environment around you. some of them are straightforward, but almost all of them make you feel like you've discovered an impossibly hidden treasure when you find and solve them. i'm looking forward to finding them all, maybe by the time i'm 30.\n\nbut really, take your time with this game, and i promise it'll be an unforgettable experience. \n\nalso, there are some interesting philosophical ramblings and a sort-of story/narrative that you discover in a non-linear way as you solve the puzzles. i like how open-ended it is, but i definitely think the Talos Principle is the best philosophical puzzle game of all time.",

        "review": "Some clever ideas, but too much of it is tedious and annoying. I like games like Portal that have a linear progression. The player is given a simple goal and the puzzles get progressively harder. It has tutorials in the beginning that familiarize you with the mechanics. You're never lost or wondering what exactly you're supposed to do even as the levels get more tricky. \r\n\r\nThe Witness, on the other hand, just throws you in and expects you to figure everything out on your own. Some people might appreciate that it doesn't hold your hand, but I found that to be a source of major frustration.\r\n\r\nThe game has a relatively big open world and doesn't give you any pointers or instructions. The first dozen puzzles are easy to figure out, but later on they get more complicated and it becomes a chore just to figure out what you're supposed to do. You have the option to skip puzzles and find something else to do, but many of them have to be activated first by solving other puzzles. That means that there's a lot of running around aimlessly just trying to find active puzzles to solve. The open world is too big and doesn't give you much direction on where to find the more beginner friendly challenges, so you waste a lot of time running from place to place.\r\n\r\nSome puzzles are more tedious than hard to figure out. They require memorization. For example, you have to walk through a maze and then draw the path you just walked. Stuff like that isn't hard or challenging. It's boring. When the best way to 'solve' a puzzle is to take out a piece of paper and draw a map or a pattern, that's a cheap puzzle that doesn't actually challenge you intellectually and just feels like a chore.\r\n\r\nI like puzzle games. I like challenging games (for example, I've managed to get all the achievements in Sekiro, which I'm pretty proud of). But one thing that always annoys me is a lack of direction. I want to know what I'm supposed to be doing. I don't want to wander aimlessly or keep having to guess how the basic mechanics of a puzzle are supposed to work. Solving the puzzle itself is supposed to be the fun part. If I spend half of that time just trying to figure out the mechanics of the puzzle, that hurts the experience.",

There are some cool puzzles here sometimes, but the amount of narration in this game that goes on for minutes on end is enough to make my ears bleed. Additionally, fuck whoever decided that puzzles should never be explained. I'm no DSP or IGN where I need every single detail explained to me, but you are given absolutely no direction at all with some of these, and it's honestly not worth it to try. Honest to god, \"The Looker\", the parody game based on The Witness is a better experience, and it's free.\r\n\r\nI got this game on a sale for 80% off and I still feel like I got ripped off for the amount of game there is here. There are dozens of other. better, puzzle games that are much more worth your time. I give the game a 3/10, with a recommendation that you go play The Looker instead.",

        "review": "Here's the short answer. It a beautiful; mechanically rich puzzle game. Its puzzles are genuinely some of the best I've seen and they are truly unique. Highly recommend playing it, but only if you're fine with never solving all of its puzzles.\n\nNow for the long answer...The whole game relies on exploration of a gorgeous and massive map with almost no defined direction. So you're free to go pretty much anywhere and solve each section of the world in the order you deem fit, which is great for when you eventually get stuck on a puzzle you don't know the rules to and can't progress in that particular area; but its also bad because you never know where you should go to learn rules to mechanics you've never seen.\n\nThis game creates a sort of game loop where you do a few puzzles, get stuck, go explore, solve some more puzzle somewhere else, and after hours of doing that, you find a tutorial for a mechanic you saw earlier; so now you have to go back and solve those puzzles, which lead to either more puzzles you don't know the rules to, or a dead end with a cryptic hint that you won't understand for a long...long time.\n\nThere are some puzzle that never give you tutorials, and you just have to infer to rules from the puzzle you get, which can be a little difficult. But in most cases, the puzzles are designed in a way where you CAN find the knowledge to solve them. I'm not sure if I'm particularly good at puzzling or if this type of puzzle is just something I'm good at, but I didn't need to look up solutions for the majority of the puzzles, I had solved around 500+ puzzles before I finally had to look up a solution to a puzzle which a lot of people said was one of the hardest to figure out. So take this paragraph with a pinch of salt if you're not a seasoned puzzle solver...in fact, I'd say that you REALLY shouldn't play this game unless you have played an extensive amount of puzzle games before it, because this will test your patience, this game will ask you to be good at visualizing multi-step processes in your head, making leaps of logic, MEMORIZING PATTERNS, constantly changing your perspective (literally and figuratively) and extrapolating information from small amount of hints.\n\nOk that paragraph went on a little long, but in short...if you want to solve this game without guides...it is going to be an arduous task. Now for a bit more spoiler-y stuff (I'll try to keep the spoilers to a minimum tho), so if you want to go in with no knowledge of the story and world-building aspects; don't read any further.\n\nSo the game has gotten some negative press for its story elements, and for a justified reason (not a good reason mind you, just justified). As you play the game, you will find these small audio players that you can interact with; which will start an audio log. These audio logs talk about philosophy and things that honestly feel very...\"artsy\" in nature. Ones I listened to a few of them, I stopped caring or paying any mind to them. None of the audio logs are needed to solve the puzzles and listening to them felt like the game creator was trying to be seen as \"sophisticated\" and as \"an intellectual\"; which honestly might be the point? not too sure?\n\nThen there is the controversial ending of the game (major spoilers!). You've been solving hundreds of puzzles at this point, and you finally find your way to the top of the mountain, for what seems like the final puzzle. To your shock, when you solve those puzzles a door opens up and you head inside the mountain into a portal-esc interior. The puzzles only get harder and challenge you in new unconventional ways and you keep struggling your way down level after level of increasingly more challenging concepts. Then you finally get to the bottom; solve 8 of the hardest to visualize puzzles (their not really that hard but its like really hard to wrap your head around them visually) and then you're presented with an elevator. You take the elevator and it takes you on a long.....long....long ride through the entire map; showing all the puzzles turning off and resetting back to being unsolved...and at the end of the ride, you're at the beginning and the game closes, when you open it back up, you're at the start of the game. None of your efforts mattered, all the puzzles you solved meant nothing, the world you awed at for hours...meant nothing. There is no explanation for why you're here, why the people are turned to stone, why you're solving these puzzles...no explanation for anything. \n\nNow to a lot of people this might be a little upsetting, which I can sympathies with; but in all honestly I feel like it was very clear from the start that this game was all about solving puzzles...just because you want to solve some good puzzles. Because there is no achievements for solving puzzles, there is nothing that indicates the percentage of puzzles you've done; only a number of puzzles you've solved. There is nothing in the game that tells you \"you've done it all, you can quit now\" and when people talk about 100% this game, it is based on an agreed amount of puzzles shown in your puzzle count. which isn't 100% accurate (there is a section in the game where you solve a bunch of puzzles and they count as less than what you actually solve) and its not 100% confirmed to be the true number of puzzles in the game. Bottom line is that 100% this game was never the point of the game, the game never expects you to solve all the puzzles and IT WILL NOT REWARD YOU FOR DOING SO. \n\nSo If you've gotten this far into my review, just know that its a great puzzle game...But for the love of god, stop playing it when you stop having fun solving the puzzles, you will gain nothing from solving any more than you want to solve...and also there is a puzzle that literally takes an hour of REAL TIME WAITING to solve...so there's that as well...\n\nGet this game, solve like 450-500 puzzles and be done with it. The visceral feeling of solving a puzzle that has been stumping you for hours is a feeling that this game will keep giving you in spades, but its all its going to give you; nothing more, nothing less. If that sounds like a good time to you; if you enjoy purely mechanical, incredibly designed puzzles placed into a pretty scenery that means absolutely nothing outside of its mechanical purposes; you will love this game.\n\nIf you want a story; a purpose for solving puzzles, then you will come out of this disappointed and with a feeling like you've wasted your time.",

This creates an island full of intrigue, that without any rewards whatsoever, makes you want to uncover every secret. The puzzles range from easy to brutally hard, but the way the game teaches you and allows you to progress at your own speed is fantastic.",

Be prepared to lookup a clue now and then unless you enjoy staring at a puzzle for half an hour or more. I had to find out what all the symbols meant and just generally what to look for when figuring out puzzles as the game doesn't do a good job of explaining anything. \r\n\r\nThe environments contain some hints and things to interact with which adds another dimension to the game, this aspect is really ingenious. However, this game is not for everyone, a completely cerebral game, nothing exciting about it just hard puzzles. Still playing the game and have a lot to do after 25+ hours although I have had this game for years.\r\n\r\nIt can be a very frustrating experience so I can't give it a great score. The originality of the game and the time and effort that must have gone in to creating this world and the puzzle content seems extraordinary, so it gets points for that. \r\n\r\nA 7/10 for me. I feel like you can achieve what is clear and still miss out on half the game, not because you didn't pay attention but because so much is hidden and not obvious. Unless you created this game or lookup stuff you will miss a lot.",

While many puzzle games keep adding different types of puzzles in an attempt to keep things fresh, ironically it is the most refreshing to see a game choose one specific style of puzzle, and spend the entire game developing and branching of from those central mechanics.   Keeps just enough of the familiar, while adding extra challenge as you go.",

You have to find out and get along on your own (or to use guides on the internet). The scenery is beautiful, but don't expect a story to be told. There are some audio quotes of historic people (hard) to be found, but they are not really related to the world.\n\nAs said the puzzles get tough. You often have to think around one or two corners. Use your ears, eyes and of course your brain to proceed. There are some timed puzzles what i hate personally, but others might like the challenge. Still struggle to get the last achievement, cause i'm too slow.\n\nRuns exceptionally well on Linux.",

If you are here because you saw a beautifully rendered and imagined world, want to explore it and uncover its mysteries, why its there and how it ended up like that, then I'm sorry to say you will only get the former thing.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, there are some standout moments where I genuinely thought \"That's clever\" but you return very quickly to the relative tedium of endless grid puzzles. I like puzzles, but wouldn't say I love them enough to do hour after hour, so naturally I accidentally discovered the \"a-ha\" moment everyone is talking about, nice and early, because such a beautiful environment begs exploring which seems at odds with what the game mostly involves.\n\nThere's clearly two games here; one is a puzzle-solving masterpiece, which is sadly sullied by a somewhat tedious, pretentious and disappointing exploration game, even if rendered beautifully.\n\nAgain, if you prize puzzles, buy it. It deserves the praise on that front. Otherwise, just watch some videos about it, get the gist, and you will basically have seen it all. Best of luck!",

If you're familiar with the setter and the types of clues they use, then its a fun and enjoyable challenge.\n\nNeedless to say I do not share the same mindset as the puzzle creators.  \n\nCould I have earned the intense satisfaction of figuring out the rules of the puzzles on my own like many other have?  Maybe...but I have limited time which is disappointing because I'm good at puzzles so this should have been my kind of thing.\n\nI needed an easier on-ramp because the change in difficulty was far, far, too rapid. \n\np.s. I also had a lot more success halfway through when I started screen shotting puzzles to figuring them out on MSpaint, rather than purely visualising in my mind.  I think the game might have been better by taking notes as well.\n\n\nEdit:  I would also say some of the audio files made me cringe intensely.",

Retrying and retrying a puzzle until you solve it is not the correct way to play (which is what most negative reviews didn't understand, somehow). The symbols all have a logic to them that can be easily apprehended, and the way the puzzles are designed force you to think critically about the restrictions that are imposed upon the lines you draw. Additionally, the environments are beautiful, and the [spoiler]puzzles within the environment[/spoiler] are excellently hidden and integrated into the world. The creator of the game is pretentious, but don't let that get in the way of your enjoyment.",

They start off so well, logical, but then the logic disappears a bit (even for someone on the spectrum, as some like to comment the game is for us). \nI straight up solved some puzzles without knowing how, just one after the other, no need to think. Came in handy towards the end with the two door puzzles that constantly switched up. No thought, just squiggly line. \nSometimes in the same row of puzzles, it was OK for the opposite colours to be together and the suddenly it wasn't. There was no explanation of how was I supposed to figure out that in one section you were only allowed to have 2 of the same colour together, when previously just the colour were supposed to be separated from each other. \nAlso map desing was bad. In the jungel it took me a solid 30min before I found the first puzzle.",

        "review": "This game is an inspiration to many, many other fantastic puzzle games. It's game design and concepts should be studied and emulated (mostly). The puzzles are interesting and fair (mostly), the environments are pretty. And it has one of the single, greatest AHA moments that truly changes how you see the game.\n\nSo why do I not recommend it. Because I truly feel like it doesn't respect you or your time, and that AHA moment quickly became the most tedious part of the game, which ruins it in hindsight. Look, you play a puzzle game for the puzzles, and that's what this is. Just puzzles. You learn the rules in different areas, exploring and backtracking as the only limit is your own knowledge. Truly, that's where the game shines, and that's what other developers should take from it (like Taiji.)\n\nThe problem is my expectations, where it felt like it was teasing more. A hidden story to unlock if you only solve just a few more puzzles. The areas were so interesting, so much environmental story telling, and yet, looking back, there was no story to tell. Audio logs drone on while you wait for baited breath to figure out why you were listening to it to begin with. And yet, in the end, *Spoilers* it's just a dream. \n\nThe game wants you to think about Perspectives. And it does this well. But man, screw those audio logs. Screw the \"puzzle\" that had you actively wait (I mean, you can't do anything else) for an HOUR of tracing. Screw THAT audio puzzle (you know the one). Screw every slow moving boat, or bridge, or door, or elevator, or windmill that ate my life away 30 seconds at a time. Doors unlock to nowhere after long puzzle chains with no reward besides finishing the puzzles themselves. It just feels pretentious,  much like this review. Strip it all away and you've got a great puzzle game in a pretty environment. Just, don't focus on anything else.",

It's the kind of game anyone who wants to make games (particularly narrative and systems designers) should try out, to see what it looks like when a game does an extremely good job of communicating exclusively through mechanics.\n\nIs it perfect? Nah. Some puzzles are a little too obtuse for their own good. (There's a section involving trees and shadows where it feels like the purpose of the game goes from \"deduce the answer\" to \"psychically intuit the mechanic, which may violate previously established rules\", which I didn't love.)\n\nBut the beauty and depth of what it achieves is just wonderful. The place my brain goes when playing this game is a place I wish more games would take me. A puzzle game where the puzzle is deductive reasoning happening inside your brain, rather than, say, turning a bunch of switches in a pump room or whatever nonsense.\n\nI'm a story and experience driven player first and foremost. If the designers of this game and I were in a room discussing games, I think we would have radically different philosophies. But this game feels like the clearest possible articulation of that design-purist, mechanics-first approach. I love it BECAUSE it's so quietly insistent in its approach. It feels like having a conversation with a very zen teacher who is gentle in their methods, yet merciless in refusing to give you the answer and demanding you learn to be brilliant.\n\nI think it's a game everyone should play at least once.",

[/h1]\n\nEvery \"puzzle\" in this game revolves around the same concept, connecting lines in a way that follows the puzzles' very specific set of rules. Sure, some of the puzzles can be unique in how they're solved, but most of them utilize symbols in a way that requires you to learn what each of them means and how to solve around them. They're introduced little by little as you explore the island, sometimes throwing in other symbols or mechanics to spice things up. But inevitably, you'll come across a puzzle you can't solve yet because you don't know how a symbol works. So then, you'll explore the island a bit, until you come to a different set of puzzles to solve, until the cycle repeats. This is why I stopped playing, because of repetitive game-play that caused me to run around in circles wondering what I was supposed to do, not wanting to look at a guide.\n\n[h2] TL;DR: The Game is good, if you have the patience to follow the game's logic. I didn't. [/h2]",

There seems to be a story that the game wanted to tell, but it's very cryptic (if not just nonsense) and totally went over my head. The game also lacks a sense of goal, solving a puzzle is really just for the sake of unlocking the next puzzle, over and over until the end (which is not really a negative if seen as a pure puzzle game).",

        "review": "This game is not for everyone.  If you don't like experimental weird shit games, don't get it.  \n\nThe Witness is hard to describe.  A large open world that you wander around in solving puzzles.  Why do you solve the puzzles?  Some times you can see that they lead to something, some times you do them because, well, this is a puzzle game and you found a puzzle.  The entire game is built upon a slowly increasing knowledge base, where you solve an extremely simple puzzle, then a slightly more complex one, until you learn the rules of that type of puzzle.  You might need to look at the puzzles from different angles, or listen carefully to sounds, but you can't even carry objects so don't worry about fetch quests.   Every puzzle in the game is totally self contained, once you understand the rules.  Like a Myst game, keeping a notebook is a must.  It has no characters in the traditional sense.  No big face slaps of \"I AM TEACHING YOU PHILOSOPHY\" like The Talos Principle. But it has strong theme, expression, and intent. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Dear god the motion sickness.  I don't get motion sickness from games, but hooooooly crap did I have to stop playing this multiple times because it made me sick.  This is especially true with some of the very late game puzzles.  The worst part of the game by far for me.\n\n-Difficulty that can be frustrating.  Almost nothing in the game is difficult in the traditional sense.  What makes the game hard is figuring out the rules, and if you don't know a rule it becomes next to impossible.  Figuring out some of them can be a challenge.\n\n-Nothing is explained in the traditional sense.  The reviews that say there are no tutorials are wrong; the entire game is a giant set of tutorials.  But you need to pay attention to every thing you do, in every puzzle, and what it means.  Woe to you if you didn't write down your discoveries. \n\n-It's slow.  Think Myst, if you played that back in the day.  Moving through spaces, exploring them, piecing together from the environment what you are supposed to even do there, if anything.  \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n-Do you like learning through doing, rather than having something explained to you?  That's the game.  That's literally the entire game.  And I mean it.  It is 30+ hours of tinkering and experimenting and [i]OH SHIT I GET IT![/i] moments where suddenly 3 of the puzzles you left behind, stuck, suddenly make sense and are child's play.  Along each of those you will discover something else and another puzzle you couldn't figure out just clicks into place.  Or maybe what you discover is a puzzle you didn't even realize was there, but you were staring at the whole time! [b]And you get lost in it.[/b]\n\n-It's beautiful.  Incredible art direction with layers and layers and layers.\n\n-It has a hard to quantify human \"art feel\".  The frustrations, and the journey.  The realizations about the game and about yourself.  It'll do things to you that suck, and it'll do things to you that are wonderful.  When I beat one of the endings I literally had to stand up and walk away from my computer. \n\n\n[b]A few ending notes[/b]\nLooking up almost anything immediately breaks the game.  This can be extremely hard to deal with in a context where the answer to not understanding something is to just look it up.  A few times in the game I \"solved\" things a bit faster than the game intended and had to slog through a dozen puzzles of ramping difficulty.  If you just look up how a mechanic works, all you're doing is slogging through puzzles that take longer to walk between than to solve.  There are multiple endings, and at some point you will probably want to look up some of that because... Well, you probably will.  I can't tell you if that is the right or the wrong move.  It will make a radical impact on your entire game experience though, and I'm not sure which way is better. \n\nDo I recommend?  For me, yes.  I also know people that would hate it, and I totally understand why.",

        "review": "[h1]This game just devolved into rubbish as I played[/h1]\r\n\r\nAs a fan of The Talos Principle, I thought this game might be worth a shot, seeing as it looked like you needed to use your brain, and I enjoy a good puzzle.\r\n\r\nSadly, the game seems hurried, unfinished, and - stupidly - unbeatable.\r\n\r\nThe core game seems fine on the surface. Beautiful colours, a nice range of varied scenery, a variety of puzzles for you to figure out. Now this is where my internal alarm went off, but I ignored it. No tutorial at all can be refreshing, and a welcome breath of fresh air compared to so many games out there that take the concept too far, but in this instance, it would have been nice to have something. I wonder how many other people had to look up the triangles rule...\r\n\r\nLater, I noticed other things. Some puzzles relied on an audio cue to let you know how to solve them. Unfortunately, the trigger for these is too broad - so when you have 4 puzzles side-by-side, all the 4 individual audio cues play at once. It's a right mess of tangled frustration.\r\n\r\nAnd the game really likes to smash you over the head with the frustration hammer. When you think you've finally got somewhere, getting into the challenge area, you'll be happy to know there is a veritable GAUNTLET of randomised puzzles you have to solve in the tiniest amount of time. It works by starting some music, and if you aren't done before it finishes, the whole lot resets. This is fine, I have no problem with this, but here's the kicker - puzzles that are meant to be solvable often load up as impossible puzzles! So you waste time, fail, retry, fail, retry, fail retry fail failtry... you get the picture. And 99% of the time it isn't your fault. \r\n\r\nNow, it's true, there is a section in that timed bit that DOES have impossible puzzles. But 1 out of 3 should be solvable, followed by another 1 out of 3 should be solvable. What I'm talking about are the rest of the timed puzzles, before you even get up to that. In between laughing so hard I'm in hysterics, and gasping for oxygen, and wiping my eyes clear of laughter tears, I have to say you can't even look up a guide to help you, as it is randomised. So you're stuck with unbeatable puzzles. \r\n\r\n\r\nSure, they've tried to pretty it up with audio files and videos that make you question reality, or try to read your future in a bowl of alphabet soup, but the reality is the game is broken, so collecting the audio files seems kinda redundant.\r\n\r\nIf you want a puzzle game that you can actually finish, I recommend Talos Principle. Until this game gets a patch to fix the random fail element I'm not touching it with a ten-foot barge pole.",

The art style is simple, yet beautifully done, with each \"zone\" having a distinct look and feel.\n\nIn a genre containing many excellent peers (The Talos Principle, Anti-Chamber, The Swapper - to name a few), The Witness somehow stands out head and shoulders above them.",

[b]Draw a line.[/b] Trace the line you see. This isn't a puzzle. This is the only mechanic in 3/14 areas. (not counting the tutorial)\n\n2. [b]Perspective.[/b] Generally the same thing as above, but you just need to walk around to find the perspective. This is the only mechanic in 5/14 areas.\n\n3. [b]Screenshot puzzles.[/b] Usually scattered around the island, but mainly used in the end area of the game. Might be connected to actual puzzles, but you have to solve them in photo editing software, because the puzzles are disconnected between multiple areas or are otherwise a pain to look at.\n\n4. [b]Arbitrary developer decision puzzle[/b]. The sound puzzles uses [i]\"small = low pitch\"[/i] but [i]\"up = high pitch\"[/i], and one of the tree puzzles uses [i]\"forward = down\"[/i]. Figuring out how the mindset of the developer affects these things is not a puzzle. \n\nThese 4 types of areas consist of 10/15 areas without any actual puzzles. That's two thirds of the game.\n\n[h1]  What about the other areas? Are the puzzles in them good? [/h1]\n\n[b]Yea.[/b] \n\nBut you're paying for 10 areas filled with no puzzles. Okay that's kind of unfair, the castle and the endgame both have a few actual puzzles, so you could count the final score as 8/15 areas. But that's still over half of the game.\n\nSo yeah, Want to buy this game? Wait for at least 50% sale.",

        "review": "I've played plenty of puzzle games recently, both on PC and on Switch, so I was pretty excited to try out The Witness.\n\nI went through two areas pretty much completely by myself and even unlocked a video. I did have some problems, like some things taking some time to happen, like water levels, but overall they were minor annoyances.\n\nSadly, when I entered \"The Quarry,\" a certain problem emerged and stuck throughout the entire area until the game left a bad taste in my mouth and I decided to stop playing; the first puzzle showcasing a new mechanic isn't understandable in any way, and sometimes you end up getting an incorrect idea on how a puzzle works. Previous puzzles were easily understandable, for example, [spoiler]separation of colors, or the reflection of the sun on the screens, or rocks in the background indicating a solution[/spoiler].\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back were two puzzles right next to each other at the very edge of the area.\n[spoiler]The puzzle in the left has squares with figures in black and white. These figures do not interact like other b/w figures, since they have different shapes. Since separation isn't the answer this time, what is the answer? It turns out, you have to separate each type by two, so now the colors can blend, but they have to be two of each color for it to work. \nThe puzzle in the right is one seen before in the same area, which I already had problems with before. Previously, you are supposed to form a specific shape based on the tiny shapes inside, but it wasn't necessary to form the shape around where the tiny one was. That's something already not very intuitive (I feel like you can tell because you wouldn't understand the previous sentence without playing the game), but with the brand new puzzle, one of the tiny shapes has a 22 degree angle. What does this mean? It means that the slightly modified shape can be rotated.[/spoiler]\n\nTo summarize, when a puzzle game stumps me, I should think \"wow, I am very dumb\" if I have a moment of weakness and check a Walk-through, not \"I was never going to figure that one out.\" And this problem only appears when a new mechanic is introduced, with the puzzle that's supposed to be easy to understand in order to increase the difficulty for that mechanic. \n\nI don't think it's a \"gitgud\" issue, because I've played plenty of puzzle games and enjoyed them.\nManifold Garden was instantly more understandable despite it having an out-of-the-box idea and conveying less information due to its minimalist art-style.\nI had the same problem of misunderstandings with Superliminal, but it didn't happen in every single puzzle in one area.\n\nIf you get easily frustrated with puzzle games, this is definitely not the game for you.",

This game is beautiful, fun, and infuriating at the same time. I dare say this is the hardest game I have ever played. No matter how maddening or annoying the puzzles may be though the vast colors and dynamic shapes of this Island would bring me back. One of the few games I could not get through without help.

        "review": "On the one hand, the puzzles are clever, the setting is gorgeous and a delight to explore, and there's a Cool Thing the game does that is unique and magical when you stumble across it. \n\nOn the other, the game is pretentious in the worst ways. It makes a huge deal out of the idea that \"different perspectives can let you perceive the world in new ways,\" and in terms of the Cool Thing, it works well in that respect. But for a game littered with audio logs, both, it sure does focus almost exclusively on white western perspectives. The audio logs have no real context; you might as well just play any other puzzle game while having an Inspirational Quotes website open in a browser.\n\nThere are multiple videos to unlock of various lectures, and wow, it's all white people sharing western perspectives. There was nothing in this game that made me feel challenged or like I had a new way of seeing the world. Want to hear about Buddhism from an actual Buddhist? Too bad. What you get instead is a white lady's take on a white man's take on Buddhism. Want to hear about Zen? Okay, here are two quotes, one from a white British guy, and the other from... the same white British guy. How about an interesting indigenous take? Nope! Here's some more high school level Western philosophy instead! Cool. It sucks. \n\nIt feels like Jonathan Blow had the opportunity to elevate some actual unique perspectives on the world, but went with the safest, most boring options possible. A tip of the hat to the most mainstream Eastern philosophies, with absolutely no effort to bring in anything actually different. What an absolute waste of an opportunity.\n\nGreat puzzles, beautiful setting. Shame the rest of the game is as shallow as can possibly be. I wish Jonathan Blow was as curious as he is clever.",

        "review": "Oh man, I loved this game. I have to write this positive review because I don't understand the hate towards this game that I see everywhere.\n\nThe Witness is an open-world puzzle game.\n\nBefore playing the game, I think it's crucial to understand the puzzle-solving system: In this game, there are no hints, no clues, and obviously, no explanations about the puzzles you need to solve. To help players understand the different puzzle rules, the game offers 'tutorial' areas, introducing rules gradually so players can learn step by step. What makes the game interesting is that you might encounter a theoretically solvable area, but it becomes impossible without having been previously through these 'tutorial' zones. This creates a desire to keep going, a curiosity to learn all the rules to complete and solve the toughest puzzles. Many players disliked this game for these reasons: limited explanations and an increasing difficulty curve of the puzzles. It's not recommended to play this game if you're not a puzzle game enthusiast.\n\n[u]SPOILER:[/u]\nThe game becomes more intriguing with its visual and audio aspects. The graphics are beautiful but almost too perfect. The sound is minimal, consisting of just footsteps and puzzle success or failure sounds, making the game feel cold and empty. To balance this, while exploring the island, you can find many graphical Easter eggs and audio logs from philosophers and scientists, promising an intriguing story. However, when you put it all together, you may end up with nothing. \nSome find it confusing, considering it a mishmash of pseudo-profound nonsense. \n\nI won't claim to have understood every nuance of the game, but by listening to audio logs and watching mini-films in the game, I think that people who complain for the reasons i said earlier totally missed out on one of the conclusions of the game: Life/this game should be a zen experience where you find contentment in simple things, like visuals, landscapes, and yourself. On the other hand, the game presents us with scientists encouraging us to understand the world around us, to seek explanations, to ask for help in understanding a bit more about what surrounds us every day. This can even be translated into the game by seeking solutions to solve puzzles that seem too difficult and impossible. The game point out that no one holds the universal truth of life and, consequently, of the game. It's all about finding a balance between an approach to life indulging in zenitude and the desire to seek explanations.\n\nYea... Actually, they were right. It's a mishmash of pseudo-profound nonsense, [u] just like life. [/u]",

ESPECIALLY! taking rides around the island on the little boat, its so cute! the puzzles can be tricky and get pretty hard, I've wandered around every inch not blocked by a gate and I'm still getting lost which is fine. its like a vacation spot, the set pieces are so nice!  the pacing is slow and allows for contemplation and mystery. highly recommend if you like puzzles and beautiful environments!",

Specially ones using the environment around you to determine the path was always weird with some fitting nicely and others seeming broken. I did enjoy a majority of the puzzle \"types\" though and for the most part when they are mixed together it was understandable.\n\nThis game is not for the faint of heart, it is extremely tough in some cases but there are tons of guides out there if you get stuck on one or two! The layout of the map maybe could've done better but it is a puzzle game and they made the whole map confusing like a puzzle so what can you do lol\n\nAlso for some reason the Steam release only has 2 achievements whereas the console versions have more? Would've been nice to have one for every beatable \"area\" of the game like the console versions but doesn't take away from this great game!\n\nMind-blowing and mind hurting, 8/10",

And I could have looked past some of the puzzles being more trial-and-error in your own position than any actual puzzle. But as someone who is red-green colorblind, hitting puzzles that are actually impossible to do because the colors are indistinguishable, with no color blind option, is frustrating. Even more frustrating is that the dev is explicitly uninterested in implementing any level of accessibility options, even for basic puzzles where something as simple as including a pattern, or adding an option to change the color schema would work just as well. And it sounds like that extends to other disabilities as well - there are auditory puzzles which have no accessibility options or aides available for users who have hearing problems. \n\nEven before running into these issues, this wasn't a game that was engaging - the amount of time spent slowly walking around the map and \"solving\" a basic puzzle a dozen times made it hard to be the only thing to focus on for me and more of something to do while watching YouTube - and it's certainly not worth $40.",

However, in my view, the environmental puzzles are the weakest part of this game. They don't require logic; instead, they demand a keen eye and pixel hunting, which quickly becomes tedious. In my opinion, the author is a very talented person, but he failed to realize the difference between SOLVING and SEARCHING. Searching and pixel hunting quickly become boring and tiring. I'm a big fan of puzzle games, but there's a limit to how much time I'm willing to invest in a game. The Witness requires an excessive amount of meticulous exploring and peering into the landscape if you aim to complete it 100%.\n\nSo, here's my advice for all newcomers to the game: try the minimal walkthrough on your own (you can finish the game without completing all puzzles), and resort to guides if you aim to finish it 100%. This approach will unveil some interesting endings and game content. Trust me – it doesn't make sense to finish it 100% on your own because it will take an enormous amount of time on average. Plus, you will clearly see (if you follow the guides on environmental puzzles) how much time a puzzle would have taken you if you attempted it on your own.\n\nTo sum it up – overall, I like this game; perhaps only Myst surpasses it. But what I don't appreciate is that it becomes tedious at some point, and we, as human beings, just don't like to hit our head against the wall without making any progress. Being unable to solve a puzzle doesn't make you stupid; spending hours and days trying to solve a puzzle that you cannot solve does.\n",

If you give it your full respect and attention, it may change your life, as it did mine. It's gift may be more than fun and satisfaction, it can become your companion and a place to visit when you need solitude and want to re-discover the wonders of existence.",

        "review": "The Witness is one of the weirder puzzle games I've played. Because the core mechanic is solving 2D mazes on screens, many of the puzzles don't seem to warrant the overarching 3D world they exist in, feeling as if they'd be more at home in a normal puzzle game. Specifically, the majority of the non-environmental puzzles didn't feel like anything special, as all I was tasked with doing was coming up with a solution for the maze I was presented with.\n\nWhere the game does shine, is with the environmental puzzles. To avoid spoilers for anyone who has yet to play the game, environmental puzzles require the use of information not directly present on the 2D maze screen to solve the maze, and it is these puzzles which justify the game's first-person perspective within a 3D world.\n\nUnfortunately, not all environmental puzzles are good. Specifically, I found the jungle audio puzzles to be miserable, having given me a literal headache when solving (from the audio, not the puzzle difficulty). Additionally, I found the shipwreck puzzle to be uniquely awful in a way that would be damning for the game as a whole, if it were not an optional side puzzle (though I wish the game made that clearer to the player, so they would wisely be able to avoid it).\n\nRegarding story, I can't say I had any idea what was meant to be going on, nor did I understand the ending. The audio logs and video clips inserted in the game seemed out-of-place, but they could easily be skipped if you weren't interested in them. Unfortunately, if you don't care for the video clips, there is no reward for completing many optional side puzzles (including the aforementioned shipwreck puzzle).\n\nStill, I found the game quite fun overall--at least, as far as completing the main game and the 'challenge'. Beyond that point, there still remained quite a few bonus or secret puzzles, but I was struck with a lack of motivation as for why I'd choose to hunt them down. The game doesn't really reward you at all for completing puzzles (beyond unlocking more puzzles), so any enjoyment here will come from intrinsic motivation in accordance with the satisfaction of solving intriguing puzzles, and once it wears out, your time with the Witness has come to a close.\n",

        "review": "\"I make my games intentionally less fun than they could be as to not distract from what they are about.\", paraphrasing the lead creator Jonathan Blow.\nThat is like baking oatmeal cookies. We could have made tasty and healthy cookies, but we really didn't want you to miss the fact that they are healthy, so who cares if it feels like chewing sand sometimes? This game is definitely healthy and more impressively, intentionally so. \n\nThe main mechanic in this game is choosing which line to retrace in the little mazes and you navigate a 3D environment to go from puzzle to puzzle. Now I was worried to fall of some narrower spaces while walking until I realized you can't, as the game in the most abstract, is like it is in it's most concrete, even while walking you retrace one of many lines in a maze.\n\nThat self-reflecting is present at each layer, in the small the medium the big, even on an emotional layer. I am not here to judge whether or not The Witness should be called a piece of art, but it definitely is an art piece. It wants to be, and proves it is, at least to those, to whom the twist in the game mechanics reveals itself.\n\nSpeaking about that twist, you either fall into one of 3 categories:\nA.)You intuitively understand\nB.)It reveals itself to you\nC.)You miss it\n\nInterestingly, if you fall in category A or C, you are left with [u]just[/u] a puzzle game, or so I thought. For me it was looking at THE tree, that helped me reconnect to my childhood. If you miss it, but you like puzzle games, I am sure this still is relaxing to you and you can finish the game without ever understanding what it is about.\n\nAbout the puzzles and their difficulty: The game does not talk. If it could, it would repeatedly utter: \"Pay attention! Do you understand?\". The first time playing I got stuck here and there. Let's say you have 5 puzzles in a row. I expected them to get more difficult, so when I was stuck on puzzle 4 I went somewhere else in the world. Now I see that the puzzles don't get more difficult, they repeat \"Pay attention! Do you understand?\". There is a reason why puzzles 1,2 and 3 were 1,2 and 3.\n\nYou ought to pay attention, until you understand.",

        "review": "Like Kentucky Route Zero did, I think The Witness accomplishes what very few games have done over the past years, at least for me: transcend what is considered a canonical adventure and reinvent narration and engagement. \n\nThis is just a puzzle game. However, how puzzles are solved and how you approach to its logics are things that are deeply connected to your personal experiences and perception. In synthesis, it is just a game about connecting lines. But the never ending shades of puzzle designs that intertwine between these simple starting and ending points are so well constructed and so exhaustive that they will make you feel like some sort of human algorithm trying to solve problems over and over again. A machine, or something along those lines.\n\nI think that if you want the definitive puzzle experience, something to push you out of your comfort zone, something that lets you rethink the way you approach obstacles, you will love The Witness. I don't really want to say more about it, other than the fact that it really is the game of life. Literally.\n\nThe only real side effect is that you will eventually go insane and will start seeing patterns everywhere. Nothing's perfect, I guess.",

There are scattered audio recorders containing quotes picked from /r/skeptic sorted by updoots, but read by a professional voice actor with a cute voice instead. The best part of the game is how thoroughly it embraces its mechanics to the exclusion of the colorblind. It takes a lot these days to prioritize your craft over the overbearing mentality of inclusion.\n\nThe worst part of the game is the audio files are baked into the executable so it's not easy to replace them with K-Pop or comedic flatulence. The good news is there are hours of old special olympics footage available online to replace the theater room videos which are in /steamapps/common/The Witness/data/videos in bink video format. Happy gaming.",

The mystery is that it is frequently unclear of the pattern being asked for and rarely so far is there any clue. However the island is pleasant enough, although I would like some music in the background, until I got to the rushing water the whole place was eerily silent, apart from my character's footsteps. No wind or bird sounds. Pleased it runs, at least so far, on win 10, as it is a win 7 game, and with Steam very meanly stopping win 7 communications next week that is important. I have 2 laptops which I will never change to Win 10 as Win 10 has stopped a number of personal configurations, such as start up sounds, colour schemes and individual font sizes and types for every aspect of the screen, icons etc. A bad mistake in Win 10. However, this game remains usable and is a relaxing game of exploration and puzzle solving with no monsters or battles in sight. Great.",

Was a bit frustrating to find that suddenly audio was important when for the most part all you hear are footsteps.\n\nOverall the game is successful in what it tries to achieve with the puzzles, which I think is to make you solve them while giving you the minimum amount of information as possible. 7/10",

It incorporates so many new and unique elements over time that by the end, it's hardly the game that it was in the beginning. I personally love puzzle games so this intrigued me but now after finishing it, I can confidently say that this is my favorite game in this genre.\n[spoiler] I don't like how once I \"finished\" the game it undid all of my progress but after seeing how good this is, I'll probably just go back and play through the whole thing again.[spoiler/]",

I'm fine with them for a little bit, but by the time I solve one area's puzzles, I'm so done.  I don't feel excited when I solve one, I'm just relieved that it's over, but then I remember there's just more line puzzles and I get frustrated.\n\nIt makes me wonder how much is just on my preferences, and how much is on the game.  Is it my fault for getting bored after the 20th line puzzle?  Should the game use more than 1 type of puzzle (it has many approaches to line puzzles, but they're still ultimately line puzzles)?  The answer may differ from person to person, but personally think the game could do more to stay interesting.",

Clues and lessons are presented but you are completely on your own with no real sense of direction. \n- The game often breaks its own rules. It presents you with a formula but may not always work the way it’s presented. \n- There is no difficulty settings. \n- Sometimes the only way to solve a puzzle is through guessing which is not based on rules or logic.  \n- Sometimes you must solve a previous puzzle again because you made an error on the current one. \n- Some puzzles have very low visibility.  \n- Spinning and flashing can be an issue for some. *Only on the final stage of the game. \n- Once you end the game you lose all end progress. You must go back to the previous save before the final stage. \n\n \nConclusion: \n\nThe Witness opens on a vibrant and wonderful island full of bold color and intriguing scenery. It really provides inspiration to explore. It felt so laid back and peaceful and despite not having music the sound effects were sufficient to create a pleasing atmosphere.  \n\nMy hopes and dreams of completing this game were rudely interrupted when I came to the realization that the execution of the games design is a little chaotic.  \n\nSome solutions are not based on logic or rules but chance alone. Low visibility was also a major factor in a few of the puzzles *not sure it’s just me. It honestly felt like you needed the eyes of a hawk and wit of Master Splinter to advance. I commend those that finished the game with no help.  \n\nIf only they could have perhaps had a plot or better sense of direction. Perhaps a difficulty setting to match one's ability or mood. \n\nOverall, The Witness provides brilliant concepts and detail which evoke mystery, thought and ultimately reward. The puzzles were not the star of the show, but the fashion in which they were presented.

        "review": "The Good: the music in this game is indescribably epic. \n\nThe Bad: only people with IQ higher than 369 are able to hear it. \n\n\nBut seriously -- the game was a letdown. Many of the puzzles are satisfying, but the later ones are punishingly difficult. On the one hand, it's true, the difficulty can correlate to the player's intelligence / observation skill, so that's fair. On the other hand, many of the puzzles' intended solutions are actually, objectively ambiguous, like [spoiler]tracing the columns in the distance on the transparent panels[/spoiler], or [spoiler]following some of the audio tones[/spoiler]. Even after I went online for some of the solutions, I still couldn't back-trace the logic of the alleged solutions and how one would arrive at them, which says that the puzzles are structured poorly. If the challenge of the game comes from poor game design, that's a big strike against the game. \n\nIn the course of exploring the island, the player will find audio recordings reading random, apparently unrelated to anything, quotes. Some of these are short and saccharine, while others drone on and on. This reminds me of a very similar game (\"The Talos Principle\") which I would describe as a clone of this one (or the other way around, I'm not sure which was more original). But while the wannabe-big-brain quotes and notes in \"The Talos Principle\" had some bearing on the setting and exposition in that game, the quotes in \"The Witness\" don't really relate to or explain anything. It's like someone checked out \"Ye Olde Booke Of Smarte Quotes\" from the local library and blindly picked a dozen of them to be shoehorned into the game for no reason. \n\nThe \"secret video codes\" which you find show people talking about such inane, sophistic, pseudo-philosophical nonsense that, after finding and watching one, I couldn't be compelled to watch the rest. Since your character can't leave the room where the video projector is to explore other things, this is basically an exercise in wasting time to watch pop-scientists smell their own farts. \n\nI honestly do like the visuals in the game, however. The colors and shading are very well done, and the sea / waves move realistically. There is some nice exploration to be had, which is satisfying when the puzzles make sense and \"click\". The way the game starts \"live\", bringing the player right into the game without any introduction or main menu even... I think that's pretty immersive and original. This mechanic works great for a game of this genre. \n\nOverall, I think the game is not very well made. Regarding the price -- $40 is beaucoup money for a game which, let's face it, few people will be able to beat without eventually searching online for solutions. So if one solves the puzzles he can, and looks up solutions to the rest, he'll get, maybe, six hours of gameplay for $40 (and not all of them will be pleasant hours, with several hours spent in frustration). This isn't worth the money, and is not the best use of time, in my view.",

        "review": "If there's one word I would use to describe The Witness, it would be \"pretentious\".\n\nComing from someone who's well-versed in games similar to it, be it puzzles or walking or atmospheric, this is clearly the worst option you could pick up. You've got Portal 1+2, two incredible games that introduce puzzles at a gradual pace with a great atmosphere and story. You've got The Talos Principle 1+2, two of my favorite games, especially with the DLC and its grandiose tone and setting. Then you've got The Witness. It has none of that.\n\nThe community has several puzzle types that have been bruteforced because they are [i] literally impossible to solve using context clues. [/i] There are puzzles in this game that break the conventional rules and understanding of what you've learned. And you can go to them all out of order. You can literally go to the most difficult portion of the map, instantly, and find yourself struggling to understand anything about what's happening beyond \"oh, there's lines\".\n\nThe ONE cool moment in this game was finding out about the hidden game mechanic that lets you draw lines across the actual environment. And while that's neat, there is no incentive or reasoning to do this and find the perfect angle or solution to a random puzzle.\n\nBelieve me, I enjoy games with AND without a point or clear direction. But this game almost revels in its mediocrity. It throws concepts and ideas at you and doesn't care if they are meaningful, they are just *there*. That, and the secret ending is pretty fucking bad.\n\nFuck you, Jonathan Blow.",

You solve other puzzles, learn something about them and then you're able to solve that puzzle you couldn't solve before.\n\nI can only solve so many puzzles and explore so much until I begin thinking that my efforts bear no fruit.

        "review": "This game didn't do much for me with the big \"video games as an artform\" shtick. For games that I think show the potential of that, I'd rather recommend titles such as Anodyne 2 and The Magic Circle, both of which feature well written original narratives rather than outsourcing their artistry to quotations of supposedly important words uttered by equally important people. I honestly didn't bother much with any of that and luckily the way the game is built respects the player's freedom to do so. No disrespect meant towards the quoted persons themselves by the way; it's more the way they are portrayed by the game that doesn't fuel my imagination or intellectual curiousity, which I'm sorry to say. The puzzles however were cool and clever most of the time, the environment beatiful and relaxing. Organically learning the language of how the different logical elements work was something I really liked and the part of the game I liked best from an artistic standpoint.",

        "review": "This is the video game equivalent of spending a weekend without the internet.\nYou have an intricately sculpted island full of puzzles, you have your two legs, that's it.\nNo fast travel. No minimap. You're forced to navigate by memory and take in the gorgeous scenery.\n\nHaving completed this game without external help, I can confidently say that every puzzle is entirely solveable if you're willing take your time and listen for what the game is trying to tell you. Puzzles teach you their rules without as much as a single word being spoken, meaning it's your own responsibility to figure out and formalise the patterns.\nSomething you learn right out of the starting area is that you WILL come across puzzles that are out of your grasp, that have rules you simply have not learned yet. The lesson here is that making a mental note and coming back later with a new perspective is part of the game.\nThere are a few puzzles (two specifically) so obtuse, they had me trying for up to an hour only to give up, which at the time felt frustrating, but only because I failed to implement what the game had taught me:\nWhen at a loss, leave and come back later!\n\nThe Witness is not a game that entertains you, nor is it a puzzle to be solved. The Witness is an experience made by passionate people, and if you want to hear what they have to share, you have to play by their rules. In practice, that means patience. A lot of it. Sometimes, getting a puzzle wrong means having to solve the previous one again, telling you \"hey, you're not meant to blindly guess, you're meant to think this through\". Taking notes is sometimes practically required, which to me only adds to the immersion.\n\nAnother beautiful aspect is how the game has no unlocks or progression outside of your knowledge. Every puzzle can be solved from the very start, given you understand their rules. This makes spoilers a serious hindrance to the spirit of the game, and only your first playthrough will capture the magic of discovery. The silver lining is that speedruns of the game are wild to watch.\n\nI had a blast. If what I'm describing sounds in any way appealing to you, I strongly suggest you give the game a go.",

Most of the \"puzzle\" games are quite like that. Rules are simple and provided to you by like reading or tutorials. Tbh, that's kinda boring. Yea, I get it, do I really have to spend 15 minutes executing it?\n\nThe other type is, you don't know the rules and you are thrown into the game. The game is now like a fantastic universe that you don't know how it works, and through logic, awareness, perception and deduction; you figure it out. Then, solving the puzzle at hand takes a few seconds. That feeling makes you feel smart, it's extremely entertaining. Examples include: Antichamber, Myst, Riven.\n\nThis game is, well, both of them, but the best parts are made of the second part, because it is not just limited to \"puzzles\", but they somehow interract with other things in a smart way. Now, you are not just solving a puzzle, you are experiencing what universe you are in. That feeling when you realize what things are, is great.\n\nThis game left an effect that stays for weeks. Played about 500 games and only a handful could do that. One of my favorite games. Also, great visuals.",

Many puzzle aren't dependent on logic but on your attentiveness. You need top look around for tree branches,  specific angles of light reflections, right perspective and other stupid stuff, to get a solution. So overall, there is some great stuff in the game, but unfortunately constant poorly designed puzzles ruin the experience.",

        "review": "The Witness is a game I have really mixed feelings about.\n\n[h3] The good [/h3]\nWhat first grabbed my attention and was ultimately one of the reasons I bought this game was how beautiful it looked. The island - extremely diverse and meticulously designed, with its vibrant colour palette and low-poly (?) art style - is truly stunning and a joy to wander about.\n\nThere's many types of puzzles, most of which follow the same formula, i.e. require you to draw a correct pattern on a grid board, but due to the level of complexity they reach later on the gameplay never quite gets boring or tedious. They are challenging but (mostly) logical. There are some exceptions to that, probably the most ridiculous one being the [spoiler] sound puzzle which tests whether or not you're tone-deaf and how clearly you can hear when someone repeatedly bangs pots and pans right next to you [/spoiler]. Sometimes a task would be artificially made more difficult than it really was, e.g. a background/squares in a colour-based puzzle would repeatedly flash and change colours, subjecting the player to epilepsy.\n\nThere's no actual story but when you explore the island, you stumble upon physical signs signifying some mystery surrounding it. Scattered all over the map there are also audio logs containing quotes from significant historical figures. All that makes you think there's more to this game than meets the eye...\n\n[h3] The bad [/h3]\n...but apparently there's not. Or maybe there is. The thing is, whatever Jon Blow wanted to convey is so muddled and vague that he may as well have sticked to puzzles. What we got here is a ubiquitous sense of some big secret and a bunch of disjointed hints that ultimately lead nowhere. \n\nThe quotes he had decided to use - quotes from great thinkers, mind you, such as Einstein, Tagore or Feynman - are devoid of all the wisdom I'm pretty sure they have in context because... they're stripped of one. They don't gain new meaning (unlike in a game like Talos Principle where different ideas are put in a proper framework) and instead come off as a non-sensical, pretentious, unbearable and laughable babble. This effect is further amplified by the stereotypically philosophical tone they're delivered in. Don't even get me started on [spoiler] the secret videos that are more of the same but longer. [/spoiler]\n\n[h3] The conclusion [/h3]\nIt seems to me that Blow (just like with Braid) wanted to keep things as unclear as possible and to me, whatever his true intent was, that's just a sign of incompetence.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game. Usually, that wouldn't be a sufficient reason for me to recommend it but despite its severe shortcomings in some areas, it excels in others and that's why I think it deserves to be experienced first-hand.\n\n\"Unique, divisive, and fiendishly clever, there are bound to be those who love it and those who absolutely hate it. Then there are those, like myself, who fall somewhere in between, able to appreciate Thekla’s achievements but frustrated at how The Witness continues to build a wall around itself, as if guarding a secret from its players.\" - The Sixth Axis\n[url] https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/01/the-witness-review/ [/url]",

        "review": "Video games have a unique artistic potential. For music, for plays, for books, they have typically been seen as extensions of the other. \"All art aspires to the condition of music\" because music was seen as the most experiential of the forms, unperturbed by the various structures and limitations placed on theatre and literature. Film, arguably, held the position upon it's realisation to challenge music. Where music was pure audio - and open to experimentation with the lack of a defined structure outside of time - film could occupy the same unstructured space in both audio AND visual.\n\nThe 20th century saw many revolutions in film. We went from live orchestra accompaniment to the evolution of the talkie. From the musicals of the immediate talkie era to surrealism of Fellini, Tarkovsky, right through to present day Lynch. True experimentation with the audio visual medium that arguably continues. Animation could be seen as a route to unlocking it, the merging of it with live action giving further potential. Some might argue the opposite, but the argument exists both ways and that is the point.\n\nWe pay extra to see live orchestra accompaniments now. To relive those early revolutionary days of film. Maybe that is the sign of some kind of limit being approached.\n\nVideo games are the great new medium of the 21st century. We are, in the 2010s and 2020s, in a similar manner to film in the 1910s and 1920s. Great works that stand the test of time are barely now being created. They are incredible compared to Pong and Tetris yes, but they are still starting points for games as art. Something like Baldurs Gate could be seen as something like Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. But this is in the sense of narrative, scope, in becoming to film what film became to theatre. For gaming to become what film is to film, we have to go more foundationally.\n\nGames are not experiential like film and music. Games are experience itself. They are fictional, yes, but so too is the daily experience of you and me. When you use your computer, you are using rocks with lightning passing through it. What makes it a computer is your experience of it. It only exists in your head, and the head of those who agree with you. The words on this screen become words only through your experience, otherwise it is light and plastic. Light and plastic, too, are simply arbitary groupings of real phenomena that help us further describe the world. What you go through in life is not reality itself but reality through a lense of fiction. With art, we create further fictions. With gaming, we can create the true experience of existing through them.\n\nThe Witness strips gaming down to this core fundamental. A simple circle and line, oft repeating, in various forms and puzzles. It is no mistake that it begins with simple puzzles on a screen - and make no mistake, this is not where the challenges end.\n\nThat is what The Witness is about. Not Tao Buddhism or anything like that, at it's core it is about the fundamental potential of video games as an art form - and it is it's own best example.\n\nYes, the art style is great. Yes, the atmosphere is brilliant. Yes, the challenges themselves - as they must - are fantastically inventive. But this is not what The Witness brings to the table that is new. Plenty of games challenge the greatest works of film, theatre, literature, music, and art itself in these aspects. The Witness attempts to warp your perception of reality itself in a simple manner, committed to with astonishing deliberateness, and in doing so unlock your view of gaming's potential to do just the same. If all experience is fiction, then the fictions you experience in gaming have the unique potential to carry through with you even after you stop playing.\n\nIn this, gaming can truly be life changing.\n\nI do not know if video games will ever reach this potential. If they do, The Witness will be looked back on as the pioneer that started it all.\n\nHave you ever seen a solar eclipse?",

You learn the rules on the go, with the game letting you figure things out puzzle by puzzle in a way that I found highly enjoyable and engaging.[/i]\n   {0}: [i]The overall look of the game is simple but functional, with some colorful areas.[/i]\n   {-}: [i]The game seemingly teases a narrative that never actually materializes. This however, will also depend on your own expectations. If you come into the game with the understanding that there's no MYSTery to uncover, you probably won't have similar hangups to mine.[/i]\n\nOverall, there are hundreds of puzzles with varying logics behind them that are worth experiencing if that's your focus. Despite my criticism about the lack of a narrative, I also still found it fun to meet the game where it is when it comes to additional content you can find while exploring. And it ends up having a small fun meta aspect that was fun to discover. Also, there's a boat you can ride in! How fun!\n\nOh, and don't worry. You don't need the extra achievement to get to the end. :D",

The many AHA! moments when you discover the different puzzle mechanics. Something that seemed impossible looks simple just after some sleep and some other puzzles in some other part of the island.\n\nAlso, that the puzzles use forms, colors, sound, environment,... They start plain (they are indeed plain grids) BUT later they interlace several concepts and become multidimensional.\n\nIt is one of the greatest or maybe the greatest puzzle game I've played.\n\nHighly recommended.",

        "review": "I love Myst and Riven and all the Cyan World games. That love brought me to The Witness. \n\nAt first, I was a little bored by the repetitive dot-to-line puzzles. I figured out a lot of them on my own, but I have been known to use a walk-through when I get too frustrated. The puzzles became tedious - I'm looking your way, tree-house - which cause me to abandon the game completely for almost a year. \n\nI will say that I DID thoroughly enjoy the shadow, reflection, and more interactive puzzles like changing water levels to reveal or hide puzzle pieces or walkways rising out of the marsh. The thrill of getting a puzzle right (like unlocking the double doors in the mountain) was exciting. The boat was pretty neat, as well, but  really only useful to get to the tree-house, unless you count the useless environmental puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of environmental puzzles, I didn't even realize they existed until I had unlocked most of my lasers. (I used a walk-through to get the tree-house finished and discovered how MANY puzzles were in this game - environmental, audio logs, discarded triangle puzzles, briefcases/the theater, and \"the challenge.\") \n\nSO I tried completing the game to 100%. I went back to each area for the \"entry/town/glass factory obelisk\" and the \"symmetry island/windmill/solar temple obelisk\" environmental puzzles, completing the discarded panels and audio logs along the way. Eventually I was like, \"why am I doing this?\" The extraneous puzzles have ZERO POINT to them, but to light things up in the lake. \n\nThe story line is just \"meh.\" The only audio log that I cared to listen to was the one on top of the mountain, where she describes the world around you being created to represent the world we, the players, know and love. The world and visuals are this games only saving grace. \n\nOverall, I think this game is worth it if it's on sale and you have a few weekends trapped in your house. It's interesting, and can be cool getting the lasers unlocked, but everything else about the game is repetitive, tedious, and pointless. The story line is convoluted. The main selling point of this game is the cool world the graphic designers created and, like, 20% of the puzzles.",

The puzzles are really engaging and clever, and it's a fun island to walk around and observe! \nDon't be misled by your first impression of the puzzles in this game! Suffice to say, they are *not* merely self-contained maze-like puzzles, there is much more to it than that as you progress through the game. \n\nThe one tip that I could find useful when starting this game is to explore the world and its puzzles *slowly*. Since it's an open-world game, it is very easy to rush through the map and find a very difficult puzzle that you haven't built up the skills for yet. To really enjoy the game go slowly and methodically over each area and tackle the easier groups of puzzles first, then after some time, try to go back to some of the isolated puzzles or puzzle-groups that you found difficult - they may not be so inscrutable after the experience you gained from solving puzzles in other areas.",

        "review": "I've been waiting to grab this game on sale and... the disappointment is immeasurable.\n\nAs others have said, there are interesting concepts with the puzzles both on board and environmental. You can see the care that has been put into crafting the different rules that you'll find across multiple locations/boards and how they interact together in more difficult scenarios. The island is beautiful with a screenshot worthy moment around every corner, but also feels too large to navigate quickly--[spoiler] even after you discover the boat[/spoiler]--when you want to revisit an area or explore.\n\nHowever, the greatest problem for me is the core game play loop. After several hours, I just cannot bring myself to do the next puzzle. Not so much out of frustration, which I feel is a warranted complaint for some, but sheer indifference. I just don't get much of, if any, catharsis or excitement from solving what equates to a mobile game puzzle. Not to say there aren't some cool moments, there are (and they're almost exclusively the environmental puzzles), but why is the bulk of the game so bland?\n\nPersonally, this plays like a mobile puzzler with a nicely built world around it that has nothing truly interesting to say [spoiler](even with its notions of interpreting reality)[/spoiler] or challenge you with. The most perplexing thing about this game is its price tag, and the 85% rating it has at the time of review. Beyond explanation for me.\n\nEdit: Its on the app store for 10 bucks, just buy it there",

        "review": "There is a considerable amount of misunderstanding surrounding the description of this game. Many people see the grid puzzles on panels and assume that this is the essence of the gameplay. In this review, I aim to illuminate parts of the nature of the game, providing you with a clearer understanding before diving into it. There are no spoilers about the story.\n\nBefore delving into the review, it's worth briefly mentioning games such as The Talos Principle or Portal. These games follow a linear structure with intricate puzzles that are largely self-contained. Players can solve one puzzle today and return ten days later to tackle another, making the gameplay quite straightforward. The quality of these games predominantly hinges on the complexity and ingenuity of the puzzles. \n\nOn the other hand, The Witness is clearly inspired by the Myst series and takes a quite unconventional approach that we aren't really used to. The journey starts with the character who has 'amnesia' and needs to explore an island to figure out what is going on.\n\n[b]- Part 1: Intro -[/b]\n\nThe island is divided into multiple regions, each featuring a set of challenges grouped around a common theme. If the player encounters difficulty with a particular set, they have the flexibility to bypass it and explore other parts of the island. This design creates a highly non-linear experience and balances exploration with puzzle solving by allowing players to gradually expand their knowledge of the world and return to previously unsolved challenges. Importantly, players are not penalized for being unable to complete a puzzle; progress can still be made, and the game can be successfully completed even with many of them left unsolved.\n\nNow, not all puzzles are easy to identify. The most common ones are found on panels of various forms within specific regions, typically grouped together and must be completed in a sequential order, with the complexity of the puzzles gradually increasing. Trial and error is employed for the simple challenges and logic is applied for the more complicated ones. This process aids the player in making sense of their rules. However, in some cases, the solution does not depend solely on the information presented on the panel, but on the environment as well. \n\nOn the opposite end, there are also numerous hidden challenges that are not presented in the standard panel form and require from the player to interact with the environment in some way, offering a welcome break from the panel puzzle-solving monotony.\n\nThe game's story unfolds through scattered audio logs across the island. Instead of straightforwardly conveying the narrative to players, these logs are deliberately enigmatic, presenting the story as quotes from influential thinkers. The player will also come across a theater and watch video clips.\n\nAs we can see, The Witness isn't just a sequence of puzzles; rather, it features multiple layers of puzzles, suggesting a more complex and intricate structure to the gameplay.\n\n[b]- Part 2: Bird's eye view -[/b]\n\nSo what type of game is The Witness? While solving the panel puzzles may seem pretty straightforward, discovering requires the player to slow down and be very observant of the surroundings. The audio logs are scattered randomly, and so are some panels. Many puzzles are hidden in plain sight, and there are also hidden rooms with extra puzzles. The more you play, the more you'll come across things that you missed because you weren't paying enough attention. Rest assured, there's a lot to discover, more than you could ever imagine. If you are stuck or frustrated, you are encouraged to take a break—perhaps move on to another area, or simply pause for a moment to enjoy the serene landscape. Its phenomenal attention to detail makes it feel like a piece of art; in a sense, it is. Ultimately, it is a game that constantly reminds us that we should live in the moment. It's peaceful, relaxing, meditative, and challenging at the same time. It's one of those experiences where the process of solving puzzles and uncovering the island's secrets is as rewarding as reaching the end.\n\nThe Witness also explores the process of learning. The game throws players into an adventure with no explicit instructions, setting the tone for a self-guided experience. Most regions introduce an independent and simple core concept. Upon completing one area, players are confident that they understand how to apply the rules learned to another one. Yet, as the game progresses, these concepts seamlessly merge, requiring application of knowledge across different areas.\n\nThis mirrors the learning process, akin to assembling smaller building blocks. The game's quality lies in refreshing the joy of learning, reminding players that learning is about discovery and understanding, a sentiment often overlooked in contemporary education. Consequently, it makes for an excellent choice for children.\n\n[b]- Part 3: Outro -[/b]\n\nNow, as with most titles, this one too has its shortcomings. Solving those panel puzzles can and will get tedious at some point. The reason for this is twofold: first, there are too many of them, and second, these puzzles aren't as sophisticated as the complex ones you'll encounter in games like The Talos Principle or Portal. Consequently, solving them doesn't feel very satisfying, although this is probably subjective. In a sense, the game distributes its difficulty across the entire island. Lastly, some puzzles can be a bit trickier or challenging, almost reaching the point of being unfair. Even if you know the rules, you may find yourself unable to solve them. All this reminds us of the challenges inherent in learning something new; the smaller building blocks are often boring and may be the source of frustration.\n\nHaving said all that, The Witness stands out as one of the few games I've played that didn't leave me feeling intellectually inadequate. This isn't by accident; it's by design. The introduction of panel puzzle mechanics, through solving puzzles of increasing difficulty, essentially serves as a tutorial. However, it never really feels like a traditional one. As a result, the primary challenge in most situations lies not in the complexity of the tasks but in the player's understanding of the rules and, consequently, the world around them. Also, unlike traditional adventure games like Myst, there's no need for \"pixel hunting\", as it's always evident what you can click on.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that this game isn't for everyone. If you approach it solely as a race to solve puzzles on panels and rush towards the end, chances are it won't resonate with you. However, if you're the type of player who relishes taking their time, finding joy in games rich with exploration, and appreciating them as an art form, then The Witness might be the perfect fit for you. That's the reason the game doesn't place stringent demands. On one hand, it presents a world, encouraging exploration and the discovery of numerous elements. On the other hand, players are at liberty to finish the game without necessarily uncovering many of its intricacies. However, by doing so, you'll likely miss out on understanding why you are on this island in the first place.\n\nTherefore, my suggestion is to take it slow and uncover as much as you can. As you delve deeper, your knowledge will likely grow, leading to a clearer and more coherent grasp of the narrative. In the end, while understanding the story should be relatively straightforward, discerning the deeper meaning(s) of the game is not entirely obvious :)\n\nGood luck!\n\n---\n\n** If you have a color vision deficiency or are tone deaf, some puzzles will pose an extra challenge. You might have to look them up or have someone else help you.",

No, the ending is unfortunatly not very fun to solve, by the ending I mean the moving puzzle and the rotating puzzle, those gave me a headache but not from thinking too hard, and the puzzle with the flashing lights hurt my eyes to look at. Then there's the set of puzzles where every puzzle affects the last which was really fun and is one of my favorites in the game, then there's that double block quad puzzle which wans't fun, then the cylinder puzzles which were also not fun. Also I love getting 100% normally but I'm not doing all of that",

The puzzle mechanics is smart, not just the difficulty, but the placement, the arrangement, and the progression of it.\n\nI feel ashamed not able to finish The Witness 100% by myself. Some puzzles are really hard, harder than a Mensa test; and I don't really have time to figure out how so I look for solutions in the Internet. Fortunately, the community is good. They don't tell you the result but rather how you might be solving the problem, so it's mostly spoiler free.\n\nReally good game, the design is good, the atmosphere is good, the world is good, the progression is good. I absolutely recommend it.",

To the point where you can't recommend it in good conscience. A game that ought to spread awareness and mindfulness, ought to give people a space to expand their mind and nurture their insight and emotional literacy, but that can only do that, if at all, by elevating a racist, sexist, transphobic, generally bigoted, rich neoliberal whiny little manbaby, who's not so much a hypocrite as a rabid enjoyer of his own farts. Imagine that game. That's the kind of game where, asked whether you recommend it, you might feel that the vibes are so bad, the ideology so subtly compromised, that you wonder whether anyone should even torrent it. Hypothetically.\n\nAnyway, this has nice art and engaging puzzles.",

I normally like to figure things our for myself in games and consider using walkthroughs a cop-out, but I spent plenty of time following walkthroughs just to save me the time it would require to solve  another @#$% variation of the same puzzle.

All very satisfying to solve and progress.  I played for 40 hours and thought I had about seen everything, but then found an entire new area to explore.  The game encourages you to poke at its edges and pull on the threads, and it succeeds entirely.\n\nThe sense of exploration and discovery is very reminiscent of the old computer game series Myst.  Interspersed throughout you will find some philosophical quotes and readings to think on, which can be very interesting if you're in the right headspace for them.  Overall an excellent world to lose yourself in, highly recommended.",

There is scenery here and there, but absolutely nothing in the world is interact-able but the puzzles which makes exploration feel terrible and meaningless. It is so fucking tedious to play...\n\nGive me a god damn menu with all my currently available puzzles. I refuse to walk around your shitty fucking world map.",

(Like the shipwreck puzzle.) \n\nHowever, I can't deny that this game has been a very easy one to sink time into, because it's low stakes and allows you to go at your own pace. Gradually moving through the island and unlocking it in segments is satisfying, and fun. \n\nBesides, after I beat it, I was seeing patterns IRL for weeks.",

It's one of those games, and it's really beautiful for that.\n\nIt's also beautiful for its aesthetics. One could probably take a picture of any one of the game's environments and use it as a wallpaper. It's quite relaxing, too.\n\nIt's also nice how the game doesn't force you to do the puzzle sections in any set order. You can go for any areas in any order you like, though you will have to eventually do them all if you actually want to finish the game.\n\nAll in all, it's quite the masterpiece, and everyone should enjoy it. I'm not too sure about the steep price tag, though. I'd wait for a sale.",

After the Pink Trees, the game became nearly impossible to complete without a walkthrough. I spent more time being frustrated than enjoying a puzzle game.  I could never access the Treehouse because my boat did not have the activation slide on the right and no where in the discussions was this topic even addressed.  The Mountain challenge should have a **Disclaimer may cause visual spasms and raging episodes.** The last part that I was not able to complete was the Pressure Pad beyond the statue.  The random sequence was not long enough and since I've used the walkthrough for most of it, I had to quit.

        "review": "I just finished 100%ing this game, so now is the best time to put my thoughts about it on paper.\n\nThis is one of the best puzzle games that I have ever played, it has one fundamental idea, builds on it throughout the entire game, and has a final challenge that introduces some very hard puzzles that are one of a kind. It makes you learn by doing, and once it finishes building that basis it reinforces it through harder and harder puzzles, questions that are very interesting to answer, and it truly makes you proficient. The witness, to quote electron delta's review of this game, asks you to \"Stop looking, start seeing.\" It does a good job at it making you able to see a solution very quickly.\n\nHowever, this is also one of the worst puzzle games I have played. Some of the puzzle types require you to sit in just the right location at just the right time, others are one-offs that require thinking in an entirely different way for a challenge puzzle. The game promotes not needing all of the lasers to enjoy the game, but requires all [spoiler]eleven of them to access the challenge area[/spoiler]. The game's downsides are not enough to hurt the positives it does.\n\n[h3]From here on out, there will be spoilers. Read at your own risk[/h3]\n\n[spoiler]There is one more horrible thing this game does, the environmental puzzles. The moment when you first see them, high atop the mountain looking down at the river, the panel next to it. The environmental puzzles add such a good dimension to the game. However going for all 135 of them is not a fun experience, some of them you need to align the clouds just right to see the line in the negative space, others you do the same but with trees, the red and purple flowers in front of the castle form puzzles, they are truly everywhere. This hunt was a truly maddening experience, the obelisks help but it has a lot of \"right place, right time, eyes on a swivel for anything remotely resembling a circle.\" And all of this is without touching on the environmental puzzle that takes 57 minutes to complete. And while you wait for the full moon to cross over that theatre screen and become eclipsed, you hear a GDC talk about easter eggs and about looking too deeply into things, all this is while you are solving an easter egg itself! The environmental puzzles are the best part of this game and the one I would most like to remove.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]The Challenge, the record player, and the puzzles needed to unlock it are the truest final boss to this game. The cavern is filled with new puzzle types and ones that use mechanics in new and interesting ways, it makes you truly think again about everything you've learned so far. And the challenge? It forces you to solve puzzles sight unseen, with around 7 minutes to solve around 20 puzzles. Using an early pathfinding puzzle with two hexagon dots to define the maze you traverse later on it s very good decision. The puzzle panels which ask you to spot the fake reinforces the \"start seeing\" mentality. Your rewards for completing this is the solution to truly leave this place. What does that \"3-2-1\" mean? Why does it undo my progress? And then hopefully you see it, you are able to touch the sun and unlock the final ending.[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, The Witness is a beautiful puzzle game that tests the player's skills and patience. You can stop whenever you want, and the game is perfectly okay with that.",

Granted, these grids have different rules... that are never explained to you. Good luck trying to find out some of the later ones,,,, the solutions are rather hard to figure out, and even when you do it is not always clear, A lot of trial and error.\n\nThere are also environmental puzzles but those all involve finding certain points of views of objects and tracing a line... oh yeah and the hints are lines on a pillar....\n\nIf this game had a story or mystery behind it, I feel like I could put up with these if there was a mystery or if I had a reason to do this, but the only story I've seen in 7 hours of trying to muscle through this is some hidden voice messages reading old quotes.... no reason or mystery to keep me engaged.\n\nI shouldnt have put so much time in trying to figure out if there is anything worthwhile here, and have found very litte. Too late for a refund, dont make the same mistake.\n\nNow if what you are looking for is pure puzzles with colourful hub world, you may like this, but if you dont like the line/grid puzzle format, there is nothing else.",

Like one review I saw said 'don't read any more reviews, just get the game'.\nI think that AUD59 is a little steep, but the devs have to eat and pay rent too right?",

The only exception is [spoiler]a color-related puzzle inside an elevator[/spoiler]. At one stage, this requires an understanding of additive color theory that Blow seems to think should be general knowledge and doesn't bother to take the opportunity to educate the player on it. If you find yourself stuck, don't hesitate to look it up.\n\nAfter completion, the free parody game \"The Looker\" is worth checking out.",

Quite quickly the game shows that there is more to this than what is visible in the puzzle monitors. Your introductions to how you should approach a new puzzle, an entire section, or an environment are heavily dependent on what you saw and learned before. \nFor me, the paths I took at the beginning of the game negatively impacted this. It took me quite some time to find the actual starting or learning locations for some of the puzzle clues (or even the fact that I should start elsewhere!), therefore the layout of the quite graphically beautiful island is its weak point, but the openness of it all was great.",

As this scene played out I was still dumbfounded, astonished, and in awe of what this team has created and I've only just begun to experience their wonderful game. Eventually it came to an end, both the scene and the game.

I am terrible w navigation :D\n450 puzzles down (w the most minimum guide - the mountain final pillar and the color board with tinted LED lights got me absolutely stuck and humbled me so badly), only Challenger achievement left to do.",

The final stretch under the mountain and the strange, cliff-hanger ending that came with it (plus an achievement left locked) suggested there was more to do. After activating more lasers that I had missed, I was given a challenge; a challenge that would nearly break me. I now have mixed feelings toward In the Hall of the Mountain King because of said challenge.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n     I'm sad that I can never experience this game the same way again and to have done it on my own made the experience much more special. While the game may be over, I guarantee I'll be spotting puzzles for the rest of my life.",

        "review": "[h1]-THE WITNESS-\n[b]HONEST REVIEW[/b][/h1]\n\n♌ The Witness is a puzzle game with the principle of \"Start from the circle, reach to the end\". The game reveals its difference with a maximum of 10 different mechanics that it can build on this foundation.\n\n❌Although having so many mechanics sounds like a good thing, the game does not try to teach you these mechanics at all, and although you do not question this at first (5 hours), as the game progresses, you start playing a game where you do not know what you are doing and why. In easy puzzles intended to teach mechanics, you try to find a solution entirely through trial and error and create a rule in your own mind. However, while your rule is valid in simple puzzles, it does not work in complex puzzles. Because you have no idea whether your rule is correct or not.\n\n❓Since our game takes place in an open world full of puzzles, you can start from any biome you want. Each biome has its own unique mechanics, but in the later puzzles of some biomes, you have to leave the biome when different mechanics are included in the puzzles. Since the game does not hold the player's hand at all, you do not know which biome to start from and where to learn which mechanics.\n\n❌Since the basis of the game is based on a very simple logic, the puzzles start to repeat themselves. Although the game tries to keep itself fresh with various mechanics, since the developer wants to fill every part of the game with puzzles, when you encounter these mechanics both in their own biomes and in different biomes, it is inevitable for them to become repetitive and instead of giving you the feeling of solving a puzzle, it gives you the feeling of doing the same thing in a different way. And after a while the it feels suck.\n\n⭐[b]A good puzzle game should open the player's mind and push him to think differently with every new puzzle it presents to the player. This game loves to be repetitive.[/b]\n\n\n✅ Let's talk about what the game did best for me and gave me a reason to finish the game:\n[b]\"Environmental Puzzles\"[/b]\nEnvironmental puzzles are puzzles that use the basic logic of the game not only in the puzzles but in the entire open world. As I said, \"The developer wanted to fill every part of the game with puzzles\", that's exactly it. So any circle shape you see in the world can be the starting point of a puzzle for you. Although these puzzles are much simpler than the mechanical puzzles that the game tries to make, they are the only type of puzzles that make the player think.\n\n✅ In order to find the puzzles in the environment, you may sometimes have to change the perspective, sometimes your angle, sometimes your location. Sometimes seek it from reflections, sometimes its light plays, and sometimes the environment, and these push the player to think differently and expand his view. Environmental puzzles are mind-expanding and well-thought-out puzzles.\n\n❌ If you are a player like me who wants to experience everything in games, you can follow these puzzles on obelisks and find out what you missed on the internet. Even though I did most of them, there were some that I missed, but the solutions to the puzzles I missed were so absurd that I can say that this mechanic has been screwed. It is impossible not to be surprised by the minds of those who think about the puzzle and find the solution after reaching the solution.\n\n📟 You may not know that there is a story in the game, because discovering this story is completely left to you, just like discovering the mechanics. However, the story it is trying to tell is quite empty and unnecessary.\n\n⏭ To summarize, the game is a game that asks you to solve puzzles by putting different mechanics on the same basis. Although it is a very catchy game with its environmental puzzles, the fact that it does not hold the player's hand and constantly falls into repetition undermines these beautiful aspects of the game.\n\n⭐ As someone who solved 520 of the 523 puzzles and 130 of the 135 environmental puzzles in the game, and who learned the mechanics completely while finishing the \"Challange Room\", I can say that this game is overrated, it is not a good puzzle game, and on an island filled to the brim with puzzles, the same mechanics are bored. .\n❗ [b]\"Too many cooks spoil the soup\"[/b] ❗\n\n👍[b][i]Don't forget to check out the game \"The Looker\" inspired by The Witness but much better designed![/i][/b]\n\n[spoiler][h3][b][u]ENDING[/u]: Man! Stop touching every circle you see![/b][/h3][/spoiler]",

        "review": "I want to preface this: this is not a game for everyone. Please take some time and watch a video of what this game is like to play. I absolutely loved this game. To me, it is fun and entertaining. I enjoyed being able to progressively solve puzzles and use collective knowledge to solve more difficult puzzles. The hidden media within the game is cryptic, but also intriguing. TLDR: if you love wandering, thinking critically, and great visuals, play this game. It may change your life.\n\nI \"finished\" the game in 30 hours over a month. I will need to play it again to get all of the obelisks completed. For those wondering if you should get this game, answer these questions: do you like puzzles of any type? This game has puzzles that get very difficult, across a host of different media. Do you have a short attention span? Do you like sitting in silence? Can you handle listening to the same sounds repeatedly? This game has no soundtrack and often there is little sound other than the puzzles you are working on and the ambient sound of your environment. Can you handle disappointment? If your answers to this are yes, then play the game. You'll like it.",

But sure.\n\n\"The Witness is a single-player game in an open world with dozens of locations to explore and over 500 puzzles.\"\n\nThis is true. (I wasn't keeping count, but it sounds right.)\n\n\"This game respects you as an intelligent player and it treats your time as precious.\"\n\nThat last part about time... is NOT true at all. You can reach the end of the game in a timely manner, but some non-mandatory puzzles require lining up things that move at an extremely slow speed, to say the least.\n\n\"There's no filler; each of those puzzles brings its own new idea into the mix. So, this is a game full of ideas.\"\n\n...I guess? I feel like the optional room full of long videos could be argued to be filler. The puzzles are pretty great, though.",

Such time consuming gameplay with no story telling is easily tiresome.\n确实是精心设计的解谜游戏，但是游戏玩法就是图形解谜，而且有的逻辑非常令人费解，玩了几小时之后感觉像是在做行测图推。\n没有故事线的让解谜更加枯燥。\n没有地图，路痴如我花了很多时间在找路。\n画面很精美。",

The game is nothing but hundreds of puzzles without the satisfaction you would feel in other puzzle games. Now, they're not bad puzzles. I really enjoyed the environmental sections and I was very surprised at how creative the mechanics were for such a simple idea. The world is beautiful and I never was angry about having to run across the island to get to another section of the map. The only thing is that there's not many \"aha!\" moments that make puzzle games so addicting, it feels more like just trying things until it works. I would be lying if I said I didn't cheat on some of the more BS sections of the game just because I didn't feel enough satisfaction to sit at one puzzle for hours. The game is great for just chilling out and enjoying the scenery, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you just REALLY like puzzles.",

This is a walking simulator-type game, so you walk around this beautiful island that is full of vibrant colors and unique sections that each hold a different \"rule\" added to the basic maze-grid puzzle you learn at the beginning. Each rule is denoted by different colors, symbols, or set-up (even sounds or shapes). However, this game does not TEACH you the rules, but guides you. There is a phrase within the education world: \"Sage on the stage, guide on the side.\" While most games may \"Sage on the Stage\" and write the rules out for you, allowing you to try out different aspects of the rules before giving you a little chance to try what you've learned. Instead, this game is a \"guide on the side\" that allows you to find the rules by trying out different things on each puzzle with increasing difficulty. I would recommend all puzzle lovers to give this game a chance but use hints or solutions if the game begins to get frustrating so that you don't lose the love for the puzzle (just try solving it yourself first). Also, if you are struggling with an area or haven't found the \"rule\" yet, go to an area and come back. You will most likely visit every area a couple different times before attempting the END ZONE (More if you try to completion it -- which I am attempting). Good luck, and think outside the box, fellow puzzlers. : )",

The game refuses to hold your hand or offer any hints, leaving you to rely on your instincts and intellect.\n\nThe lack of hand-holding might be frustrating at times, like trying to find your way in a dark room without a flashlight. However, it's this sense of discovery and accomplishment that makes solving each puzzle all the more rewarding.\n\nSecrets and Layers:\nThe Witness is more than just a collection of puzzles; it's a game of layers and hidden meanings. The island is filled with cryptic symbols and secrets, like an ancient code waiting to be deciphered.\n\nExploring the depths of the island and uncovering its hidden secrets is like peeling back the layers of an onion.

So, go in knowing that.\n\nHowever, the game does get all the mileage it can out of a relatively simple basis for solution representation, and (for the most part) I did enjoy it. (Even if several hours of my playtime are in attempts at a certain optional challenge, which I kept *just* failing at the last, and which is almost certainly antithetical in its design to the rest of the game.)",

The \"story\" is there to frame the game and add to the atmosphere, and it's doing that fine.\n\nThe real heart of the game is in the world and the puzzles. The world is super atmospheric and filled with secrets and eastereggs. The puzzles are creative and difficult, but never unfair and If you're stuck, that usually just means you need to further explore the world for clues.\n\nIt's so good in what it does that I can't even begrudge it's pretentiousness, It's earned it.",

And if you do get this game I highly recommend not using any videos or anything like that, because it is a awesome game that have really cool solutions to the puzzles, and using a video would make you miss out on finding the solution yourself. but over all I highly recommend it to any one who likes puzzle games.",

Before you consider purchasing this, do some self reflection and be sure you also LOVE puzzles. I mean L-O-V-E. If you do not, then I would not recommend.\n\nIf you do LOVE puzzles, here is an idea of what you will probably need to complete this game -- at least I did:\n   - The ability to hear well and distinguish different pitches and sounds\n   - The ability to see and differentiate all colors on the human spectrum (do not buy if you are colorblind)\n   - Notebook and pen (graph paper works best)\n   - Windows snipping tool\n   - Photo editor and/or MS Paint - you need to be able crop, rotate, and invert screen shots, as well as paste images together.\n   - A guide for hints if you get stuck (I like the IGN guide)\n\nWhat put me on the fence about this recommendation is that, after using the above tools several times, solving some of these puzzles felt like work, and not fun. Sure, it's satisfying when you do eventually solve them, but it can be exhausting. Also, don't expect much of a reward after solving them. You don't really get anything except the ability to move onto the next puzzle in the series. This process is pretty uncharacteristic in today's gaming climate. It was fine for me, but just be sure to know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nThe world is beautiful, but don't expect to do much except walk around and solve puzzles. This is what the game designer intended, and this is what they delivered.\n\nRecommended if you LOVE puzzles. Literally \"LOVE.\" Otherwise, expect to refund.",

There is an abundance of puzzles, and pretty much no reward. In some areas, depending on which direction I look, the framerate drops to a sad 30-40. The virtual cursor is much slower than my real cursor and there is no way to adjust it. Not worth the full price if you want to have fun.",

        "review": "0% story, 0% mystery, 0 % journey. And most of all – 0% meaning.\nThroughout the game you anticipate having fun or discover hidden alien plot, or even play horror game in disguise. At least witness something. But there's nothing. There's only this fake plastic island.\nOh, wait. There is gameplay. There are a ton of variations of 1 puzzle. A fuскing maze. Everywhere. Especially \"love\" the treehouses part.\nYou can interpret \"draw the line\" however you want, but you still only dragging mouse from start to finish. Over. And over. And over again.\nYeah, cool environmental stuff, perspective views. First couple times when you discover them. But waiting for the windmill to turn? Cloud to move? Full hour moon story at the end? An unforgivable waste of time.\n\nMaybe this game is just art in some form? A pretentious one for sure.\nSome zen or hinduism philosophy? Barely. Fake one, I would say.\nMaybe some inspiration in here? Hell no. Only smug quotes contradicting each other if you start analyzing them. Scattered all around tapes made just for one thing – not to walk in silence.\nBonus points for putting Richard Feynman in them, you fucker. Thank God, Sagan cost too much money for you. Yeah, I did hear cave records.\n\nYou think you could 100% run this game to get some last reward. But it's still pointless. No climax, no realization, no afterthought. One static island, that's it.\nSeriously, it's more enjoyable to solve sudoku or something, at least that will make your brain work. I did enjoy the last challenge, though.\n\nIn summary, there's no harmony in this game, Jonathan. I even watched your documentary by Noclip. And if you did the same, you could spot contradictions in your words.\nMaybe you should not overthink your game ideas and then wander around for the exit. Maybe then It could take less than 7 years to develop.\n\nMaybe. Who knows. Nobody should look for answers, at least that thought wise blonde lady said to me in the theater.\n\nWill I ever play this game again? Fuск no.\nWould I recommend it? Yeah, actually. You need to finish the Witness to fully laugh at the best sequel in the history of games – the Looker.",

And the challenges aren't well sorted for gradual increased difficulty: sometimes an impossible maze (= after days of trying I had to use a walk-through) is followed by a trivial maze I solved on the first casual try. Like, Beta testing should have helped them do some triage. I won't even go into the many totally arbitrary \"guess the rules\" gotcha mazes... Sure, it's pretty to look at, but that's good for a couple of hours, not the 35 it took me to slog through this even with the help of a walk-through. Myst it ain't; not even the least inspired parts of Myst are this one-note. One star out of ten.",

Some of the mechanics are really hard to figure out, and the game definitely does not always treat your time as precious in the way it wants you to believe based on its description.\n\nIf you love puzzles, and can get behind a little-to-no tutorial approach, this game is definitely worth a shot. If you can't figure something out, go explore another part of the island and you might find an easier version of it. If you have explored everything and you still can't figure it out, sometimes it is worth looking up hints. The community is pretty good about not outright spoiling solutions, and some of the mechanics were a little too obtuse and I was glad I looked at hints.",

        "review": "The first time I finished The Witness was over six years ago on mobile. I only went through what I needed to complete the game at that time and didn't go around finding more afterwards. The second time was two years ago on PC where I combed through every area, [spoiler]solved most perspective puzzles, found the secret ending, and found every vault including the challenge.[/spoiler] And now as of a few weeks ago, I've played through the game a third time and more or less 100% it. Despite what many people are saying about it, The Witness continues to be my favorite puzzle game ever made.\n\nThe thing that many people overlook is what The Witness does NOT have. There is no start screen. There is no music. There is no HUD. There is no map[spoiler] (besides the boat and in the lake)[/spoiler]. There is no companion to interrupt you and say \"Ohhhh it seems that you are having trouble there. Would you like a hint shit for brains.\" There is only you and the island. The only bit of gaminess stapled on are the settings and quit button. It doesn't have anything else because it doesn't [i]need[/i] anything else.\n\nI have also heard of complaints that because there is no hand holding that the mechanics can't be taught well enough. That has to do with the capability of the player to learn from previously completed puzzles and adapt their understanding of the mechanics accordingly. If you think that a puzzle should be solved from what you understand and yet your solution is wrong, then the problem lies with you and not the puzzle itself. If you are stuck, go to a different part of the island and come back later. If you still can't solve it, just look at a guild.\n\nThere is also this large sentiment even from fans of the game that Jonathan Blow is pretentious because of the [spoiler]audio logs and movie clips[/spoiler] found in the game. Much like the puzzle mechanics, these are put in to change one's perspective. About who we are. About how to find truth. Different people will resonate with each one differently, but to discredit them as just pretentious is a bit of a disservice.\n\nThere is much more I want to talk about like the design of the puzzles itself and the various scenes of perspective and the ending itself which is also unfairly hated, but I'll just leave it as that. For what could easily have been a simple puzzle game neatly sectioned into levels and with no added complexity, Johnathan Blow went much more than an extra mile to make what I can now call my favorite puzzle game.\n\n[spoiler]Fuck the red ship door though. I don't know how anyone can defend that.[/spoiler]",

There are definitely many pros as well as cons, so I'm gonna try to lay it all out and I'll leave it up to you as to whether or not its worth your time:\n\nPros:\n\nThe game itself is slow and calculating to the point where it teaches you the mechanics of the puzzle systems piece by piece, slowly building upon whatever you've previously learned and expanding it to vast proportions. \n\nIf you ever find yourself unsure of how to proceed because it seems the game just hasn't provided you with enough information to solve the puzzles, there is a chance the solution to the puzzles can actually be found in the environment around you. Some puzzles require you to adjust the camera angle just right so you can see the solutions illuminated in the sun's light, while other puzzles may require you to raise or lower the room's overall water levels so you could see the solutions in the water's reflection.\n\nThere is zero background music, giving you the player a vast natural ambiance to help you focus with zero distractions. \n\nThe game is long, and brilliant. If you've got nothing but time on you're hands and wish for something that would serve as a simple distraction, this game would be the best damn thing for you. It is so easy to loose yourself in this game, forget the world around you and immerse yourself in the shear intricacies of life within this game. \n\nCons:\n\nThis game is super intricate with it's environmental hints and clues to solving the puzzles, so intricate in fact that anybody who isn't excessively observant enough may find themselves in a situation where they may begin to feel inadequacy towards their own capabilities. \n\nThe game-play is long and slow, so much so that if you're a gamer like me who plays games with the intent to record and upload for the amusement of an audience, I can not recommend this game for you. It's too long, too quiet for audience interest, and while it may seem like the game has some intriguing lore or story of some sort, it's never properly explained and leaves the players feeling cheated in some way. Like you've arrived at the scene of some great apocalyptic disaster, and there's nothing and nobody left to explain to you or help you understand what happened. \n\nSo, all in all it is a good game. Not exactly the best, and definitely something to avoid like the plague if your just looking for content, however as a simple time waster I honestly couldn't recommend it enough.",

I also can't even begin to imagine how you would tackle the task of programming this. From a technical point of view and in terms of craftsmanship, this game is a masterpiece.\n\nHowever, it's not really fun to play. I wouldn't call this bad, if there was a way to rate in stars I would give it a more nuanced rating. But ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this when you are looking for a puzzle game. The game mainly features two types of puzzles. On the one hand you find grids and have to draw a continuous line on those, following rules like passing through certain points or seperating coloured blocks with those lines. Those puzzles feel similar to for example sudoko: most of them are singular puzzles that could very well appear in a puzzle book that you might take on a train ride. Those aren't bad, but also not so outstanding that I would recommend the game just for those. The main selling point of the game is the second type of puzzle. Here to you have to draw lines, but you won't see rules on the grid but rather the environment will give you clues, for example in shadows or tree branches. Those are what make the game unique, but in my opinion also what made it boring and tidious. The biggest part of the game was spamming wasd and spinning my mouse in search for any kind of clue anywhere. I can imagine that some people want this, but for me it felt mostly like a drag.",

It was so fun to explore the island (which was way better looking than it needed to be), figure out how the puzzles work, and solve them. The puzzles are not easy though, so only play this game if you're willing to really think. Also has optional content beyond just beating the game, but stopping right after beating the main game is perfectly satisfying as well.",

I can't be arsed to find every useless tape or every dorito panel scattered around the island. \nIt's a decent puzzle game, but there's no point to any of it. It's about everything and nothing at the same time. Try it if you like connecting dots.\n\nI liked James Burke, Richard Feynman and Ashley Johnson. Fuck tetris.",

There are bits that are a bit pretentious, but do offer good food for thought and seem fitting within the atmosphere of the game. There is a natural progression but it manages to have a sandbox feel that was surprising, though unintuitive to myself.\n\nAlthough $40 USD is excessive, I would say it is worth $20 for its uniqueness and considerable difficultly. As of writing it is on sale for $10, which I would consider a good deal.",

It is super worth it I'd claim, even though I still have something unsolved,\n\nThis game is going to make you think, in many more ways than one.\n\nIt is up to you if you like that or not, but if you do,  you will gain an experience of a lifetime out of this game.\n\nGramophone / 10",

No real story, no music, no dialogue (kinda), just a million puzzles in the same format with different gimmicks. Gimmicks that range from fun to boring to unfair.  \n\nMaybe someone who enjoys puzzles more than I would be more positive towards this game but as is this review only barely came out as recommended. If you're a more casual puzzle game enjoyer like myself, don't drop $40 on this, wait for a sale.",

        "review": "I don't know if I can accurately put in to words the way that I feel about The Witness. \n\nI can recognize that it is absolutely not for everyone with its gameplay consisting of variations of the same puzzle over and over. The reward is more line puzzles. The atmosphere is kind and calm, yet oddly empty. It's not unnerving, but there's definitely a feeling in your lower gut walking around this seemingly formerly populated island.\n\nIt's not for everyone. But it is for me. The puzzles never felt unfair or too crazy to grasp. The slow burn of the way the game wordlessly teaches you the rules makes me feel smart as much as I feel dumb. The game starts off neat enough, I was going through this word somewhat aimlessly, solving random panels I came across hoping to find a goal to work toward. And I did eventually find it. Seeing the first laser come out and point toward the mountain was the first time the game hooked me. \n\nThe game hooked me about 4 different times. Each time, my opinion of the game grew more favorable. \n\nI don't want to get into spoilers because if you allow yourself to be along for the ride and give the puzzles your all, there are some moments in here that will absolutely floor you like they did me. Truly, if you like puzzle games and you're even a little interested, do it. Play The Witness as blind as possible.",

This game gave me weeks of puzzle solving fun before I finally solved it, and sometimes I sat on a specific puzzle for days on end (most recently for about a month on the same silly puzzle), though there is always a solution; it's never out of bad design that I get stuck. This struggle is integral to what I consider to be a good puzzle game.",

It has challenging and thought provoking puzzles mixed with an enchanting, mysterious, beautiful atmosphere. It feels as though each small detail is considered and tweaked to provide a deeply unique and intriguing experience. The technical aspects of the game are near perfect, and the creativity and gameplay is incredible. It leaves a lot of questions to be answered on your own or left unanswered. As you play you feel the immense amount of effort and care put into the game. I recommend to play it and do all the puzzles legit if you can.",

And DONT get me started on those puzzles sequences where if you fail one the screen shuts off and you need to re-do the previous one. Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?\n\nI dont mind difficulty, i mind when the game introduces a new puzzle mechanic that is never explained and you have to look up a guide with the answer and spoil you JUST to see WHAT you had to be paying attention to to even be able to solve it in the first place. There's a point in which the issue stops being patience or attention or smarts and it starts being about guessing what's going on that i hate.\n\nIf you are interested, go play \"The Looker\". Its a parody game of this that is also free, much shorter, has better puzzles and will give you at least a laugh.",

        "review": "The Witness is a nearly perfect environmental puzzle game for the first 15 or so hours. It's puzzles are very well designed, there are a truly shocking number of secrets to find around the world, and the environment is genuinely visually stunning. The game is far from perfect however. Over the span of a single hour, The Witness went from my all time favorite puzzle game ever, to something I genuinely couldn't imagine picking up again. It's end-game puzzles are either extremely obtuse, pointlessly frustrating, or both.\n\nMy advice to those considering buying The Witness are:\n\n1) Don't try to 100% the game. Hell, don't even try for 90%. Get as far as you can while still having fun. The moment you stop having fun is when you should put the game down, because it'll genuinely drive you insane.\n2) If you get stuck on a difficult puzzle, don't hesitate to look up a hint or solution. Chances are the game didn't communicate what you need to do in order to properly solve it, and there's no sense in ruining good experiences with nearly impossible puzzles.\n3) If you come across a puzzle with symbols you don't recognize, that's the game telling you to go somewhere else. While the game is technically \"open world\", it tries to lock some sections behind difficult and unfamiliar puzzles.\n4) The Witness has no accessibility options, so if you have a sensory impairment (specifically hearing, sight, or color blindness), many puzzles (including some needed to progress through the game) will be entirely impossible to solve without help.\n\nIf I could just forget the entire last section of The Witness, I would, and this would still be my favorite puzzle game ever. But I can't, so all I can do is recommend others not make the same mistake as me. Don't try to 100% the game. If you can buy it on sale, do it, and only play for as long as you can handle. Leave the game there, and remember the good parts.",

I've tried for near hours on one or two puzzles and the satisfaction of finally getting it is great, you will never be able to do that puzzle again unspoiled.\n\nAlso, if you like philosophy, this game surprisingly was pretty thought provoking and probably one of the things that jump started my interest in the subject.\n\nMy interpretation of the game is that [spoiler] the entire game is a metaphor for the process of learning. From the very start, you are put into the game with no knowledge like a baby. Nothing is ever explained explicitly, you need to figure out what everything means, just like how when going about the world you develop your own understanding of it and the rules of this world. By the end, you become literate in all these symbols and patterns \n by purely learning on your own. Also...

Every single thing about this game is that way for a carefully considered reason, and the synthesis between ideas and mechanics as you progress is without equal. You're doomed if you don't think outside the box here. This on its own would easily make The Witness a remarkable outing, but there's also the peaceful and reflection presentation of the game world, and the puzzles themselves will have you feeling like some sort of bumbling neanderthal, but they're never unfair, which makes that eventual \"a-ha\" moment hit so much harder than any \"just good\" puzzler. There's no narrative to speak of in this game, but I think it can still teach us much about patience and perception.",

Идея всей этой головоломки до жути проста, вести линии в нужном направлении от начала и до конца при разных условиях, но именно это цепляет интерес к прохождению. Буду откровенен, мне пришлось воспользоваться подсказками в некоторых моментах (особенно в конце, где происходит лютая дичь с эпилептическими наметками) но блин, вся игра проходится спокойно, если думать головой и не сдаваться.",

This game makes me feel the same was as HM2 but dialed up to 100 times. It's not unusual to finish a level (or find a solution online) and shout out loud \"WHAT? WHY?\".\n\nI don't recommend this game to anyone that wants to finish it. It's obtuse, obscure, irritating, annoying, and the developer more than likely intended it to be all of those things. I can appreciate Jonathan Blow but I don't enjoy his game.\n\nThere is no way to check your progress, there are no sound options, hints and success conditions for each puzzle (even during that puzzle type introduction) are incongruous. The developer does not want you to succeed, which makes it feel in some way pretentious.\n\nI will still chip away at this while I'm doing something else so that it doesn't annoy me as much, but who knows if I will ever finish it. I can't check my progress, and I'll only live another 40 years so it's extremely unlikely.",

        "review": "[u]The Witness[/u] is set in a gorgeous world with a very accessible user interface. The puzzles are all the same variety: start at a circle, follow a line. The game adds complexity in each new area you access in a very reasonable way.  Unfortunately, sometimes the \"tutorial\" puzzle screens are locked behind a puzzle that requires you to intuit information you don't have yet. You have to brute-force guess FAR more often than is forgivable for a professionally-crafted, playtested full-release game. Expect to consult a hint-guide or walkthrough.\n\nThe people I know who love this game delight in the environment and the simplicity of the puzzle structure. I agree that these things are delightful! The biggest struggle I have is this game's relationship to its own narrative. The Steam blurb says [i]\"You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home.\"[/i]  THIS DESCRIPTION IS A PATENT MISREPRESENTATION OF THIS GAME. There are vanishingly few clues (seriously: like 50-something voice-recordings and six videos) and they do not form much of a cohesive narrative at all. Past the First Ending (there are at least two), there are more \"clues\" that suggest something bigger than just \"walk around and have a pleasant time in this beautiful world solving a puzzle maze now and again\" HOWEVER the game never lines things up for you.\n\nThe recordings are all extremely pretentious quotes by Christian theologians from the Renaissance or a couple Chinese philosophers (vast minority), or a bunch of modern scientists. Honestly, the whole thing feels extremely White, Christian Atheist: \"I reject the notion of God or destiny, because I can't know it, so nothing is worth anything.\"  Frankly, it's boring. And the \"clues\" the player DOES find indicate ||that a team of people went to an awful lot of trouble to manufacture this world|| so the narrative and the gameplay are at odds. If you want to send a message that \"The present experience is all there is, so enjoy yourself!\" then you need to make sure all of your game elements support that. If that ISN'T the message you're sending, then maybe quit saying it so often and make sure you ARE saying the thing you mean to say.\n\nIn my culture, I grew up with the notion that, on one hand, \"The world was created for me,\" while on the other \"I am but dust and ashes.\"  Two notes in my figurative pockets is a better exploration of philosophy than this entire game, which I took 61 hours to complete, hoping to find something of substance.  I even waited [b]literally 56 minutes[/b] through a whole video of ADHD rambling to solve an environmental puzzle.\n\nFurther: this game will be ENTIRELY INACCESSIBLE to people with visual acuity issues (particularly color-blindness) or are hard of hearing (one whole puzzle area requires hearing specific sounds through audio interference). There are no settings to accommodate for this.\n\nBut hey! The world is pretty and if you are just looking for someplace fun to run around and maybe solve a puzzle or two, this game is for you. If you're looking for depth of narrative or a game that respects your time as a player, [i]Caveat Emptor[/i].",

The puzzles were challenging, and you’re never given any written or spoken hints—you just have to figure out the secret from your environment. But it does a good job of slowly teaching you a new concept, starting with a basic puzzle and then building up the difficulty.\n\nIf you get stuck, go away and work in a different part of the island. Sometimes you’ll learn a specific trick that’ll help you solve what you were stuck on. But even if not, you’ll come back with a new perspective.\n\nAlso, look VERY closely at your environment and try looking at your puzzles from different angles!",

        "review": "The Witness is not a game for everyone. The game in itself isn't as much of a puzzle as it is a learning experience. That being said, I am enjoying every minute of it. \n\nSomething to be noted about this game, is that there is a huge learning curve. There is no direction, no instructions, you are supposed to figure out everything yourself. And there will come multiple times throughout the game that you feel like you are stuck. I think a good portion of the bad reviews are because people just couldn't end up taking the time to figure out certain puzzles (which is understandable, but then again, read the first sentence of this review). I found myself leaving the game multiple times and then coming back to it just to find out how I was overlooking something very simple. If anyone can sit through this game in one sitting, they must be some super intelligent genius or something (if this is you props to you and stay far away from me). \n\nJokes aside, I really enjoy the atmosphere of this game. It can come across as a little weird sometimes in the way it talks about intelligence and the mind, but if you can get past that I think you will find the game really immersive. I would also HEAVILY suggest not looking up any spoilers or any walkthroughs of the game as the adrenaline I got/am getting was from finishing puzzles and seeing where they led me. \n\nThis game definitely takes time, and if you are not willing to put in hours upon hours of puzzle-solving, I would look somewhere else.",

        "review": "The game is probably fun for amazingly smart people. I'm only a little bit smart and that is clearly not enough for this game. But if I was smart enough, I doubt I would have liked the game. Because it lacks at two key aspects that make a game fun or interesting, namely (1) story and (2) gameplay. \n\nThe story\nThe isn't a real story in this game. There are elements that hint towards a story, and there is a second ending that tries to give the impression of a story (the protagonist is a VR game tester), but a real story remains absent. People who like this game often give pretentious and modern artsy type of answers that the story is what you interpret it to be. To me this is just a cop out as you can say this literally about anything. \n\nGameplay\nMoreover, the absense of a story is also important for the gameplay. The game is very non-lineair, which many people would love, but without a story it gives you no purpose or goal to go anywhere. I'm sure there was an artsy idea behind it like 'people create their own purpose'  or perhaps one can do things in their own pace. But to me it made the game just feel a bit aimless and confusing. The confusing part is for instance, that because I saw a statue of a person early on, I though this would be interesting and I should go there. But sadly it was one of the hardest area's, and should have been reserved as a final area. After a while it became clear that if you stumble on an area that is too hard, you should just move to another area, but there are no clues to which one would be best. \n\nThe game basically consists of a bunch of games where you need to draw a line through a maze. There are different rules, such as that it needs to contain a certain tetris like shape, or that stars of the same color should be combined, etc. But the basic gameplay is always the same. \n\nThe rules are often introduced quite cleverly, with some 'training puzzles'. These are very easy mazes that have only a few possible outcomes, and thus it becomes quickly obvious what a certain rule is. Then usually there are a few more difficult mazes, which are fun, and then there are even more difficult mazes, which combines the new rule with rules from other mazes, and then there are more difficult mazes, and then again, and again and again. A good example was the game mechanic in the ruins part of the game. Here the correct path in the maze was visible in a certain angle (light was important here). So after discovering how to find the correct angles, the game gives you more mazes, but now you cannot find the angle without moving stuff, and then you get some more mazes where you have to move even more stuff, and then you get some more mazes where you need to move stuff not just once, but a bunch of times, and then you get a maze where you need to move stuff and look in the reflection of the water, and then you get a maze where you need to move stuff and look in the reflection of the water and move even more stuff again, and so on. \nIn short, when you figure out a rule it’s fun, but it severely overstays its welcome and quickly becomes a chore. \n\nWhen combining many rules, it sometimes became too difficult to me. But I imagine that if you are color blind or even hard of hearing, it becomes impossible. Some puzzles use sound as a hint. And for many puzzles you need to see colors really well. \n\nAnother design choice I didn't like was that the puzzles didn't only become hardly due to more logical rules, it often became harder because of dumb obstacles. For instance, a sound puzzle where the beeps would guide you through the maze, just had some telephone sounds to overrule the beeping sounds. Or sometimes you would have to look from a certain angle, and later in the game the puzzles would start moving around (very dizzying!). It didn't really make the puzzle more fun, or more intellectually stimulating, just more annoying. \n\nAll in all, the game felt like a chore, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Because I couldn't be bothered with some really hard puzzles, I did look up the solutions sometimes... So this means I did finish it, even though I didn’t like it... and I am not quite sure why. Perhaps because I did like the atmosphere and landscape of the island. But in all honesty, it felt more like an OCD thing. A pressing negative feeling that I just needed to have closure to this somehow very claustrophobic feeling game. \nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 8/10\nGameplay: 5/10\nStory: 4/10\nAtmosphere: 9/10\n\nTLDR: Game too hard, or frustrating, and overstay their welcome. Story is missing. Only play if you are big mode brain \n",

You (the dumbfuck) didn't understand the unwritten rules and are a fool for not understanding what the dev already knew when they made the new puzzle. I wouldn't be so harsh but this game costs real money. Money you had to earn by working. Money you could have spent on any other game, which is what I suggest you do with that money. Instead try Portal or Manifold Garden.",

        "review": "I'm so sorry but I just don't understand why everyone likes this game. I loved Jonathan Blow's talks on conferences and I love his philosophy, but this game.. It's just bad, sorry.\n\nNavigating through the game is pretty much impossible, you never know whether you're supposed to be solving a puzzle or not which can get you stuck for hours if you think you're supposed to solve a puzzle when you're not, or even days if you thought you were not supposed to solve a puzzle when you were.\nThe puzzles themselves, the graphics and the whole atmosphere is really good, but it's not good enough to overlook the basic failings of this game.\n\nThe navigation in this game is so very tedious and unintuitive. One could either spend years looking through the terrain trying to find every hidden thing or one could try to follow a sort of natural path instead which would lead to not only missing majority of the puzzles but also eventually into a dead-end. Getting into one such dead end would require a lot of backtracking and remembering where things were, which would be nearly impossible since the journey would've taken a few days by then and this game doesn't have anything particularly memorable.\n\nThat's on top of the fact that there is no save feature, only load. And the autosave overwrites the current loaded one, making it impossible to backtrack without solving the same puzzles over and over and over and over. And what's even worse, the autosave frequently (always, in my experience) happens in the exact moment you fail some sort of a time-based challenge, of which there are way too many to keep backtracking every time.\n\nThe core design of this game is something I personally just genuinely despise. It's not just puzzles. You have spend hours on finding the puzzles, then you have to spend hours on checking whether the puzzle is solvable without external clues, then you have to spend hours finding the clues. They could be visual clues, auditory clues, spacial clues, luminal clues. And you never quite know whether you need them or not, so you pick up on patterns that aren't there, or miss other patterns entirely. Once you've gone through this process for one line of puzzles, all of the remaining puzzles in that line are dead simple and boring, with no real reward.\n\nThe whole experience feels like the game trying to convince you it's really clever while actually only obfuscating the simple, boring puzzles. Or alternatively, from what I know of Blow's approach to developing this game, it feels like he saw potential in the simple concept of line puzzles and attempted to extract the deeper meaning and the emergent complexity into a puzzle game but ended up forcing incompatible concepts onto it just to complete what has been started.",

If you're a fan of puzzle games, this is some of the best content in the genre, though if you not you may find this game too enigmatic for you.\n\nAs many people know this game is best played blind, so without spoiling anything I can confidently say that this game makes me think more than any other I've ever played, and to a certain degree has changed me as a person. The gameplay more or less stays the same, but there's so much mystery within that you're constantly finding something new that makes the game much more intriguing.\n\nIf any of this sounds at all interesting, play The Witness, you won't regret it.\n\n",

        "review": "I picked recommend, but this game really makes me wish there was a neutral option.\n\nThis game will challenge you intellectually because it never gives you any instructions. You just explore and find puzzles to solve. These puzzles start off simple enough to learn the rules and then get more complex. You're never told any of the rules, so you either need to figure it out for yourself through trial and error or look them up. I did a mix of both (and still haven't run into all of them, as of this review).\n\nMy experience so far has been alternating frustration and satisfaction. Overall, I'd say that I spend more time being frustrated with the puzzles than happy with the progress I've made. If I continue to play this game (and I'm pretty sure I will), it's not for the enjoyment of playing a game but to challenge myself. Based off of other reviews, I'm not expecting any big payoff at the end. Solving the puzzles is the whole point, so if you're the type of player that would look up solutions to progress, I'd say don't bother with this game.\n\nAlso, I agree with others who call the overall tone of this game pretentious. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why. Maybe it says more about me than the game itself. Edit: Just another hour in and after one less subtle recording found, I think I can better put my finger on what I don't like about the tone of this game. It's a religious game pretending to not be a religious game. There were other hints before, including the name itself, but it mostly just gave this sense of \"I know the answers to all of your questions. Well, no, not those ones, but to all of the questions you should be asking instead of the ones you are.\"\n\nIn any case, if you're looking for something fun and/or easy, I'd suggest skipping this one. If you're looking for something to challenge your mind, then this might be it.",

Feels like a pretty, interactive book of mazes but half of them are swapped out for Sudoku.\n\nThe art direction is awesome, everything you look at in this game is gorgeous. A ton of the puzzles have really good environmental clues to them. These are by far my favorite. Unfortunately that's only about 50% of the puzzles. The other 50% are the reason I am not leaving a positive review. The non environmental puzzles take SIGNIFICANTLY more time akin to staring at a Sudoku puzzle trying to figure out the \"one correct\" solution rather than searching the beautiful surroundings for clues. If you are someone else who has played this game I am specifically lamenting the block puzzles being put seemingly everywhere after they are introduced and seem to be padding the game up until the end.\n\nOpening the last area has one of the more cool environmental puzzles but this leads to a series of non environmental puzzles to beat the game that I can't bring myself to complete. They are the same puzzles you complete the entire game but with annoying \"broken parts\" just to slow you down entering in the solutions. If they had cut out a large portion of these non environmental puzzles imo this would be a 9/10 as the good parts of this game are great for what they are. Would compare it to a story game or tv show just having a little too much filler.",

        "review": "This is my first negative review on Steam and hopefully the only one I will ever do.\nThe Witness is honestly the single most insufferable and annoying puzzle game I have ever played. It’s bad enough that I think going back to the first Professor Layton and solving all those stupid-ass sliding puzzles all over again would be a better experience lmao.\n\nI actually really enjoyed the first 60% or so of the game, but the other 40% completely soured the whole experience. It actually starts pretty fun, but the more I progressed, the less and less energy and motivation I had to keep going. The annoyance over some stupidly difficult and/or bullshit puzzles plus their general repetitiveness really starts to build up after a while. Oh, and speaking of horrible puzzles, thank you devs for putting a fucking puzzle with crazy flashing rainbow lights not soon after the ones that seems specifically designed to cause motion sickness, I greatly appreciated the headache 👍👍\nThere are also puzzles that are apparently literally unsolvable if you have color blindness or hearing impairments, which as we all know is always a very good sign of great game design lol\nAnyway, after some point I started straight up looking up every solution because I couldn’t be bothered anymore. The sole thing keeping me going was some form of sunk cost fallacy. I kept hoping that the terrible parts were just temporary and that things would go back to being fun again, but they never did.\n\nOh and btw, did you know this game apparently has a story?? Well, I only do now because I googled it, since the game puts near zero effort into even implying it does. In fact, I bet most people only know there’s supposed to be a story here because the devs came out on interviews saying so. Allegedly, the idea that there’s narrative here is apparently “implied” via the use of ridiculously-hard-to-see cassette tapes scattered around the map, which are also so well hidden I believe most sane players upon finding them would think they are just neat completely optional collectibles/easter eggs at best. I think I found 2 or 3 of them in my entire playthrough by the way, and there are [spoiler]over 40[/spoiler], so I guess you really need to go out of your way to spot them, huh? lol\nAgain, I’m not sure how the players are supposed to figure out there is a story when the game literally doesn’t tell you anything of the sort (or anything at all for that matter) since the game appears to have an intense aversion to telling you stuff directly. I guess being terrified of words must really be part of the game’s minimalist philosophy lol\n\nHonestly, the game as a whole just feels very pretentious and seems to think it’s smarter than it actually is (it really isn’t lmao). From the tapes that contain readings of stuff said by philosophers, scientists and whoever else, to the minimalist puzzle design that is apparently somehow meant to make you question your “ideas” and “interpretations of reality” or whatever, everything just screams “hey guys, look at how smart my game is :))))”. It’s just too much. Way too much lmao.\n\nWell, I don’t know what else to say at this point. In short, it feels as if the game was so busy being focused on being “minimalist”, “philosophical” and “artsy” that at some point it completely forgot to actually be enjoyable. Maybe I’m looking at this through the wrong perspective (heh), but I’m also not willing to go back and experience anything from this game ever again, as I’d rather go play something that I feel actually respects my time and me as a player.\n\nJust go play another puzzle game like The Talos Principle, it's a better use of your time and money. Or don’t, maybe you’ll like this shit lol. That insufferable last 40% sure wasn’t for me.",

The world is shallow, you are weightless, and your actions mean little. Contrary to the store page summary, you do not 'regain your memory' or 'find your way home'. I don't think these are spoilers, because they are absent entirely - the subject of your memory or journey simply doesn't come up. Some Googling suggests that this is perhaps partly referenced in a secret post-game area, but: too bad! That's not the game! You have to put it in the main bit!\n\nThe story, if you can call it that, is sadly a pretentious bust. Recitals of abstracts from astronauts and 15th-century theologians do not a narrative make. Not even if they are (as one indeed is) 8 whole minutes long. The ending is a dire disappointment that made me wish I hadn't bothered persevering. I even unlocked the [i]secret[/i] ending, with its corresponding real-life video, but all that did was make it [i]more[/i] apparent in a truly toe-curling manner that the supposed intelligence is all affectation. Real 17-year-old film student stuff.\n\nI could bear with the poseur philosophising (some of the quotes are nice!) and the abstraction and the quasi-mysticism if the game was itself fun to play. But it's not. Again, and in typing here I now realise this is the binding theme, The Witness is simply desperate to show you how clever it is. When it isn't. A recurring sin is that obfuscation is mistaken for acumen. The difficulty curve more generally is off-grade and poorly designed, with low levels of the satisfaction payoff that it should provide. The many layers of mechanics do not change that the core challenge is repetitive, and occasional dynamic features are clunky. \n\nIf I had paid full price for this I would be really annoyed. Don't bother. For better servings on religion, philosophy, humanity, voice acting, story, and puzzles - get The Talos Principle instead.\n",

        "review": "The Witness is a hidden gem in puzzle games, beautifully designed in every aspect imaginable, but what surprised me is that it is - apart from the early game - exceptionally difficult! This game is hardcore when it comes to puzzling. It is so hard that I think accessibility is significantly reduced by it, since a difficult puzzle is not the same as, for instance, Dark Souls difficult. Games like that are beatable with devotion, dedication and persistence, but that will get you nowhere in The Witness. To beat this, you need the mental capacity. Or cheat and look up everything.\n\nThe Witness is on par with great puzzle games like Portal (2), Talos Principle, or Myst. Those are the memorable ones I've played (with more to come) but the Witness is without a doubt the hardest of these games. I was stuck on some puzzles for days. I was not able to complete this without the use of pen and paper, or screenshots where I could draw in, and it looks like I am not alone here. I am not sure if it a wise move to make a puzzle game this difficult. The end result is a game that I think most players will not be able to complete or enjoy because I believe intelligence is actually required for a player to finish and enjoy this. The game does not hold your hand, you are left with figuring out the rules through trial and error and although the game is clearly designed to be beatable, you do have to think outside the box multiple times. The difficulty should not be underestimated, even if you've completed multiple puzzle video games and do sudokus and crosswords in your spare time. The Witness is not for everyone.\n\nI would only recommend this to players that fit the profile of high intelligence, strong analytical skills, can think outside the box and a 'bring it on' mentality. If you are *not* 'blessed' with high intelligence, or easily get frustrated when you don't understand what the game wants you to do, then stay clear. You will hate it and leave a bad review.",

Every location in the small world of The Witness is unique, beautiful, and chock-full of puzzles. Exploring the various parts of the map is a treat in itself, but the real fun comes from the puzzles of increasing difficulty scattered throughout the map. \n\nHowever, the game was not perfect. Getting to the end of the game, which can be done by following certain markers on the map, resets all progress the player has made. Additionally, the player is not required to complete the areas around the map before ending the game, which made for a disappointing end scene. Even still, a solid 9/10 game.",

Out of every puzzle game I've ever played, no other has ever taught it's mechanics this well. The beginning is very well paced, gives freedom of choice, let's you learn at your own pace, and then, after wandering this dystopian island for what feels like days, the \"lore\" hits. If that's what you'd even call it. From the secrets the island holds within, to the philosophical quotes from time to time, everything is a much welcomed surprise. To any puzzle/board game enthusiasts, I highly recommend giving this masterpiece a go.",

In The Witness, you don't have a path, you have to come up with a path and read the developers mind in order to progress. It's like I'm solving a test that sorts some type of people out based on their answers, because only these people can see what the creator had in mind.\nIt's just a simulator of the Android unlock screen that quickly gets annoying + a pretty walking sim.\nBetter play The Talos Principle or Antichamber.",

There is no guide, no story, you aren't told where to go and what to do, the puzzles start being more and more difficult with you having absolutely no idea how to complete them. Oh, you need to finish a puzzle to have easier access to another area, well fuck you, here's some tetris block and remember to make it the way we want, no alternative paths allowed. It makes you feel like the devs are spitting at you for trying to finish the game. I was eager to complete it, because I've heard the ending is quite surprising but with this kind of attitude towards the player, I wish I didn't buy the product.",

Also when i first got into the game i found some secret area i guess the devs werent expecting people to find and the first 25 minutes of the game was wandering around some teleporting base listening to special thanks to random people and some really pretentious poetry or something. Then it just cuts to this bizarre video of someone waking up from surgical VR and wandering around an office or house or something, never says anything or really does anything but tap on things and eat a cookie. Im all for weird stuff but at least make it interesting and maybe save it for a later part of the game instead of letting people land right in all this convolution right at the start. I dont know who i would recommend this too, I dont know anyone who wants to do 5000 boring maze puzzles.",

        "review": "The Witness is a masterfully crafted puzzle game that delights and challenges players with its beautifully designed world and complex brainteasers. From the moment you set foot on the island, you're swept away by the stunning landscapes, the ambient sounds of nature, and the sense of mystery that permeates every corner of the environment.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are elegant and sophisticated, ranging from simple line drawings to multi-layered, multi-step problems that require careful observation and logical deduction. Each puzzle is like a mini-work of art, a perfect balance of form and function that will leave you feeling both accomplished and enlightened.\n\nWhat sets The Witness apart from other puzzle games is the way it seamlessly integrates its challenges into the larger context of the island's lore and narrative. As you progress through the game, you'll uncover hidden secrets and subtle clues that shed light on the island's enigmatic past and present. The puzzles themselves become a key part of this narrative, serving as both a metaphor for the challenges we face in life and a means of exploring the deeper mysteries of existence.\n\nThe Witness is a game that rewards patience, persistence, and open-mindedness. It's not a game that you can rush through or beat by brute force. Instead, it requires careful observation, careful listening, and careful thought. But the rewards are well worth the effort: a deep sense of satisfaction, a heightened appreciation for the power of human intelligence, and a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the world around us.\n\nIn short, The Witness is a must-play game for anyone who loves puzzles, storytelling, or just beautiful, immersive game worlds. It's a triumph of game design and a testament to the boundless creativity of the human mind.",

I also found the movies you find in the game both touching and fascinating, as well as all the random audio logs scattered about from great thinkers to be worth pondering. One sequence in particular where you have to solve a series of puzzles under a time constraint and escalating classical music, was probably the most fun I've ever had in a puzzle game.\n\nIts not quite like other puzzle games such as Myst or Quern where you have to use items and interact with the world, but nevertheless I found it quite absorbing to solve the dozens of variations on the same basic logic puzzle being put forward (essentially finding some way to get from the start to the end of the puzzle while fulfilling various conditions of increasing complexity). Some of the solutions and settings are really quite ingenious. But beyond that is the world itself...its like walking through an art painting. There are many points in the story where you just want to take a minute to enjoy the surroundings and the beauty of the world around you.\n\nThe developer of this game clearly put a lot of heart and soul into the game, and I really think that gamers who enjoyed Myst will find it to be a rewarding experience. I don't think you're meant to finish it in one sitting, but rather come back to it again and again. It is a wonderful bit of escapism to a pastel-coloured paradise world with clever puzzles and a mysterious story.",

You must have a lot of patience and you must enjoy puzzles to even have a chance of getting very far in The Witness - but while my enjoyment ran out towards the end (I like puzzles, but not that much!), I still consider this to have been a worthwhile use of my time. The island is uncanny and atmospheric, as long as you don't expect it to feel real or alive: it's not natural but a constructed space for you to ponder questions and mysteries. And yes, there is a touch of \"All of this is deep, innit?\" to The Witness, but if you can take this in your stride, The Witness's island is worth a visit.",

        "review": "tl;dr It's a great puzzle game with interesting and fun to learn mechanics that got me pretty addicted, but some parts are really annoying and exist just to test your patience and tolerance for bs. No other game has given me as many headaches as this one, so take it easy if you try it. Also the price might be a little high, so maybe wait for it to be on sale like I did.\n\nThere's barely any story or soundtrack, it's just puzzle after puzzle with a pretty interesting way of introducing the mechanics, where they don't tell you anything and instead make you explore to find more information on how to solve them. That's exactly what I was looking for and why I was so hooked on the game. If you like puzzles and want to challenge yourself I highly recommend it.\n\nThe island is neatly split into different areas, each with a different mechanic introduced to the player. This is my favorite part of the game, because of how you have access to most of them, and are free to leave a puzzle to come back when you feel like it. All of them are intuitive to certain extend, but most of the time will be spent figuring out what the game wants you to do. Clear some areas to progress and that's it. Also, some puzzles require you to tell colors apart or listen carefully to in-game sounds, which might worsen the experience to people with certain level of colorblindness or hearing problems.\n\nA few spoilers ahead since the endgame and postgame are worth mentioning... The endgame part mixes some of the mechanics learned throughout the island, but makes it so the difficulty is mostly lost, and instead you have these simple puzzles that feel like they were made just to be as annoying as possible. Like making the interfaces move, or barely visible, or blink with bright colors, or spin around. Multiple times I had to step out and leave because of head pains. After that, if you decide to keep playing and go for 100%, the game wants you to clear all areas from before and play a boring version of Where's Waldo with dots and lines. There's not much to this part since most of the puzzles here consist of \"stand in the right place\". The timed challenge, on the other hand, was probably the part I enjoyed the most, challenging your memory and knowledge of the mechanics of the game while trying not to run out of time, makes me wish there was more of that.\n\nIn the end, this game will be stuck in my head for a while because of the experience, including the satisfactions and frustrations it gave me.",

Desert ruins and shady trees were my favorite sections and interacted with the environment in creative ways. \n\nBut some of the puzzles were boring and too abundant. Treehouse had so many puzzles that had no reason to be in 3D. They could be a $5 game or a free mobile game with ads and it wouldn't have changed anything. The swamp section similarly lasted too long and didn't really do much with the environment either.\n\nThere is way more to this game than I thought, even after \"beating it.\" I only found one obelisk puzzle and that was at the very end of the game. I only found two videos to play under the windmill too. Doing the challenge for the hidden achievement was fun and so was the endgame. \n\nOverall I think it was cool but if anyone told me they hated this game I would understand because a lot of it is terrible. There are slow moving platforms that don't need to move as slow as they do. It can be hard to navigate the island sometimes, too, and if you have to look up a guide for a handful of puzzles because you missed something that they are trying to teach you, I get it.",

        "review": "The game takes place on a beautiful, uninhabited island filled with puzzles and challenges for the player to solve. The Witness is a game that is not only entertaining, but thought-provoking and visually stunning.\n\nThe puzzles are simple in concept, but challenging in execution. The game uses a series of line puzzles, where the player must draw a line from one point to another while following certain rules. The puzzles start out relatively easy, but they gradually become more difficult as the player progresses through the game. Each section of the island is dedicated to a different type of puzzle, such as mazes or color puzzles, which keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects is the island itself. The game's environments are beautifully designed, with lush landscapes and stunning vistas. The game uses a vibrant color palette, which makes the island feel alive and full of energy. The sound design is also noteworthy, with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that adds to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe Witness also has a strong narrative element. As the player solves puzzles and explores the island, they uncover audio recordings and environmental clues that slowly reveal the backstory of the island and its mysterious creator. The game's story is open to interpretation and invites players to come up with their own theories and ideas about what is really going on.\n\nThe Witness is an incredibly well-crafted game that is both challenging and thought-provoking. It is a game that rewards exploration and encourages players to think outside the box. The game's beautiful visuals and haunting soundtrack create a truly immersive experience. For fans of puzzle games, The Witness is a must-play title that will provide hours of entertainment and mental stimulation.",

        "review": "A fiendish puzzle game.I wasn't convinced to begin with, but it won me over. \nMy 4 stages of Witness:\n1. Ambivalence. This is straightforward, I could play any number of mobile puzzle games that do the same thing.\n2. Frustration. This puzzle seems impossible, there's no clue on how to solve this. This game is unfair and stupid.\n3. Eureka. Ah, I solved this puzzle and now I get how to solve that other impossible puzzle. I'm a genius.\n4. Addiction. Hmm... I'll just try one more.\n\nThis is tough and compelling. The puzzles (10 hours in) are hard (or very hard), but fair. You can get them eventually.\n\nRecommendations. \n- Don't be afraid to move on if you're stuck. Some puzzles are basically impossible until you've done some simpler puzzles elsewhere that will clarify some rules, symbols, or other quirks. There are tons of puzzles, there's another one just around the corner if you're  struggling. \n- Don't be afraid to take screenshots or get out a piece of paper, some puzzles are tough to work out on the screen. \n- If you don't like logic puzzles then this is not for you, it's literally the entire game.Finally, although the landscape plays into some of the puzzles, there's no real story to speak of. If you're here, you're here for the puzzles.",

From what I've heard the developer wanted to see what he can get away with, and it certainly feels like that. I felt more like being played than playing myself.\n\nAt the time you realize that you can't solve any of the puzzles except the ones in the beginning without help it'll be too late for a refund. At least it was for me.\n\nOh and forget about the \"story\", it feels pointless and doesn't got anywhere. It tries so hard to be deep and mystical, but in the end it's just doesn't make any sense and lacks depth.",

        "review": "---{ A lesson in bad puzzle design }---\n\nI have a few simple guiding heuristics on which I judge all puzzle games: \n\n[1] Puzzles should be self-contained and the knowledge required to solve the puzzle should be accessible and available when the puzzle is presented. If not, it had better be obvious that the player doesn't have the solution and will have to return in a metroid-vania fashion.\n\n[2] Deceptive tricks and illusions are for magic shows and politics, they are not fun puzzle mechanics, and they are annoying as politicians and magicians.\n\n[3] If you introduce a mechanic, the introduction of the mechanic should be obvious enough so that the player is given a fair chance to take the information in and use it for future puzzles.\n\n[4] The meta-structure should be mostly linear, with little confusion as to where to find the next puzzle.\n\nWhen this principle is not met, I lose patience, and I stop trusting the person (or team) who designed the puzzle because they've proven to me that they are willing to waste my time by sending me on a snipe hunt when all along I was never properly equipped to succeed.\n\nSome games I feel live up to these principles well are \"Baba is You\", \"Portal\", \"Human Resource Machine\", and \"Outer Wilds\".\n\nThe Witness failed this test when I had to start wandering around the island to find out where the introductory puzzles to a new mechanic I needed were, at this point the game became obtuse and too much to track in my head without external notes and use of screenshots. It almost entirely lost me at that point, but I resolved to rely on those tools in an effort to see this game out. What eventually had me fed up with The Witness were a few points where the context of the environment pointed to an obvious solution, that was somehow not correct. Sometimes I would be left stumped, others I would brute force a solution I arrived at was not intuitive in the slightest. Another breaking point was a puzzle-set where the solutions require the player to listen for audible queues that were invisible otherwise (not intuitive, and the game did not introduce this concept in the slightest). Yet another offense was when the key to a puzzle was hidden in a corner while another key was adjacent to the puzzle and served as a red herring to mislead the player. These little tricks are not clever, deceit and lack of intuitive interaction are lazy design practices. \n\nI know this is a 7 year old game but it's one I don't recommend puzzle enthusiasts come back to unless you're okay relying on a guide to make up for the game's edgy desire to be mysterious and intransigent, or if you just like wasting hours upon hours guessing and checking which area you might need to be working toward next.",

To be fair, the dev really put a lot of effort into the puzzles, and they CAN be difficult since the game is constantly adding new rules to them and making them more complex. But they are all still the same puzzles you solve the same way. After sinking as much time as I have into playing this, I honestly don't feel like finishing.

They are annoying, frustrating, and even when you solve them, there is no satisfaction, just a \"oh, so that was it\" feeling.\n- Unfortunately, you need to work on both. You can focus more on one type, but you still need to solve some series in the other type to access the ending, and all of the series to reach the challenge area.\n- The endgame phase adds some new mechanics (same logic): some are interesting, some are super-annoying.\n\nOverall, although there were some satisfying aspects, the experience was seriously lacking.\n",

        "review": "I love puzzle games, and this was SOOO close to being another, but ultimately I can't recommend it. \n\nIt's 1 mechanic with new rules throughout the game. I did a few hundred of these puzzles and at a certain point, I just stopped caring. Why am I here? What does it mean? Well, I beat it and I only have a vague idea. \n\nOn the plus side: Atmospheric beauty\nCalming meditative vibes\nMostly at your pace gaming\nAudio logs with calming voices\nMysteries and optional finds\nPerspective plays a huge role in the solutions\n\nOn the minus: The ending is flashy and rotates which was not fun.\nThere's puzzles with audio solutions as a rule... so if you can't hear, you're SOL I guess.\nHundreds of things that felt the exact same as the last whatever many I just did.",

It creates new ideas and builds endlessly upon them creating new ways to think and see and always in a way that if you get stuck it's on you, and if you only take the time and contemplate eventually realization will come like revelation.\n\nUntil . . .\n\nUntil the treetops, where so many get stuck on one of the toughest new concepts because the puzzle that actually introduces it, and the one that reinforces the idea are /after/ a large puzzle that uses it. Until the bamboo when the new concept flips off anyone with any form of hearing issue AND if you don't get it right the first time you're now penalized and forced to re-do the last puzzle (sometimes in a different part of  the maze) before you can try again (because, it not as if puzzles are about working out solutions...). Until you worked out the solution but you have to dance around finding the exact angle where the game isn't angry at the two pixels of overlap it put over the board. Until an endgame where the actual puzzle parts are barely a puzzle, it's fighting the interface or flashing lights or a timed memory test and all that build up of progressive puzzles has been completely abandoned for twitchy gimmicks.\n\nExpect to be frustrated/locked out if you:\nCan't do fast paced, twitch reactions\nHave ANY form of colorblindness\nHave any form of hearing issues\nHave a reaction to flashing lights (doesn't need to be epilepsy; I don't, but I'm still writing this with a headache)\n\n\n(Also, not major, but simple navigation is made onerous by not only a lack of jump button, but a proliferation of /ankle/ high walls)",

        "review": "It's one of those games you should and shouldn't play. I find this game similar essence of the Talos principle, the only difference is that Talos gives us a narrative, a reason to continue so we can understand more, and learn more. In the Witness you have actors reading quotes from famous philosophers and a very tiny narrative that is explained only at a secret ending. \n\nI have played the witness a total of 3 times\n-first when it came out, played for 4 hours got bored and left. \n-Second time was 3-4 years later, I wanted to play, and enjoy the game. And for a time I did, but then I resorted to guides as I found some of the puzzles just annoyingly tedious and lacking fun. Finished the game with guides. And felt... meh. \n-Third time was this week, wanted to achieve 100% in the game. I came close until I returned to the tedious and annoying puzzles. And once again I resorted to guides as I found myself hitting a spiky brick wall that leads to an even spikier brick wall. So, I finished the game again feeling meh. Didn't even 100% the game. \n\nI love puzzles. One of my first games was Myst so I find them incredibly enjoyable. But The Witness lacks in engaging the player whilst also not caring about the player. You can spend two-hours on a single section of puzzles and feel as if you've just clocked out of a shift from an office job. Now that's not me saying I want confetti and someone petting my shoulder and whispering \"good job\".  Because I don't want that. I want to feel enjoyment and purpose in solving these puzzles. Which you do not get. \n\nWhat you do get is a false purpose, once you activate one of the lasers you feel a goal has been set by the game. The mountain. The final location. But that isn't true, you can go there from the start of the game. and enter after 7 lasers. Once you enter the mountain it feels like a test that makes sure you remember every rule so far, while twisting them to make them fresh again, It doesn't succeed in that, what it does is make them even more annoying.  So that's when I pulled the guide and rushed through the puzzles, couldn't be arsed anymore. Once I got to the elevator I just felt empty and tired. If this is by design, then good job, you have bored and annoyed me in my free time. \n\nThis may come off as only a negative review, so let's jump to the positive things.\n  -The game is utterly beautiful, every part of the island feels, looks, and sounds amazing. \n-Some parts of the island are fun, like the castle, and the desert.  And that's it for me. The rest felt just either too fast or too annoying.\n-Hearing Ashley Johnson whispering philosophy in my ear makes my fucking day. This game unlocked a new kink for me. \n\nSo back to our problem, The Witness fails in being... well... a game. It feels like more of an experience than actually playing a game. Every time I go back to it I feel as if I'm experiencing something. Not necessarily something good. The game's true story is that you are a developer testing the game (Super meta). The secret ending is you coming out of the machine fully insane and obsessed with the line puzzles. And that's it. The voice actors are also devs of the game, but that's technically not canon. If you go on youtube and hear all of the audio logs. You will find them commenting about the logs and the game.  Proving they are aware of the island and you. But because the narrative was scraped. We are left with an empty story and a pointless adventure. \n\nAnd so, the essence of Talos comes here.  A game that acts more like a game than an experience, Talos gives the player a goal and a mystery to solve. And they give you answers that fit. In the Witness, you can ask all you like but you won't get an answer. \n\nIf you only want to solve line puzzles for hours and hours. Go ahead, play this. But if you are looking for something more than line puzzles and philosophy quotes. Go and play the Talos principle.\n2/5",

Some parts were such a joy, some parts are downright painful. One part made me want to keep playing it forever, another part literally gave me a mental breakdown (or something close to it).\n\nI am glad I have finished this game. Not only because I have completed a great challenge, but also because I don't have to suffer through this game anymore.\n\nThis game can feel so rewarding, yet also one of the most painful experiences I have had in recent years in gaming. (Do note I said it [i]feels[/i] rewarding, you gotta have an intrinsic joy for puzzles to keep that feeling though.)\n\nDo [b]not[/b] play this game if you do not [i]really[/i] enjoy puzzles. This game is almost only puzzles. There is a bit of philosophy (which you will be too mentally engaged/fatigued to think about), but there is no story or music or lore or reward or anything. The only reward is more puzzles. You complete puzzles so you get to complete more puzzles so you can complete more puzzles. It is like a big Sudoku book, and once you complete one you get to complete 5 more. Each book twists the formula a bit, but by the end of the last Sudoku book you won't want to play Sudoku anymore. (Maybe this game is best experienced, where you complete one puzzle a day or only play when you have nothing else going on or only complete one section a week/month/year or something. I don't know...)\n\nIf you are someone who finds puzzles to be something that pads out a game, someone who sighs gently when they get stuck at a puzzle in a story game, or only played Portal 2 for the witty dialogue and story first and the puzzles second... then do not play this game.\n\nIf you do enjoy puzzles, then go ahead and play the game. At times you should have fun, but to limit suffering allow yourself to look up hints and guides and just understand you will never 100% this game on your own.\n\nThis is not the sort of game you complete without a guide or some hints, even without going for secrets you will certainly need help.\n\n[spoiler]The Challenge looks actually interesting at first, but probably only because I like the music. Also I [b]love[/b] the environmental puzzles. I just think it is a bit naff that there seems to be no reward for finding them all.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall... get it on sale if you are willing to play with hints or not complete the game.\n\nAs for those wondering I completed 90-95%+ puzzles without any sort of guides or hints. However, I really threw in the towel at the end. I also threw around a lot of swear words.\n\n[spoiler]Also I activated all the lasers, which I don't think you needed to do to get the \"Endgame\" ending... so yeah.[/spoiler]",

If you like Myst or Journey, this is probably right up your alley. Although the puzzles in The Witness are superficially similar, the designers have come up with so many variations and dimensions that one is never bored (sometimes frustrated, but never bored!); attention to detail and lateral thinking are rewarded. The (mostly) nonverbal nature of the game also appeals to me. The island itself is varied enough that, even with my GPU-less off-the-shelf graphics, the visuals are endlessly fascinating. I especially like how every area of the island has multiple layers; as one plays and learns more, one can revisit a place and solve the puzzles needed to delve further.",

If either of these describes you, there will be a few parts of this game that are basically impossible without a guide.\n\n2.  Those with low IQ.  This issue shouldn't be overblown--the greatest challenges in the game have little to do with IQ and a great deal to do with stretching your mind a bit and seeing things in a different way.  Nevertheless, some aspects of the game feel a little bit like the kinds of puzzles you might see on an IQ exam.\n\nMost importantly, though...\n\n3.  People in a hurry.  This is the big one.  The game expects you to take a leisurely approach:  put down your copy of Marcel Proust, sip a glass of wine, stroke your chin a bit, and enjoy slowly turning around the puzzles thrown at you.  You *will* get stumped on occasion.  And if you're eager to make quick progress every time you sit down to this game, you will probably be frustrated.\n\n*  *  *\n\nJust as an aside...the various messages have a similar arc to them.  I'm not sure if I'm altogether on board with that arc.

Some sequences drag on forever.\n\nI recommend it with a \"meh\" rating. It is a game. You can play it.",

Essentially this a \"connect the dots\" puzzle game. A lot of the same kind of puzzles over and over again, with little to no direction(aka what to do and where to go). You just gotta go about figuring out what to do and how to do it. If that's fun to you, I'd recommend this. If you'd like at least a hint to know what you're suppose to be doing, then this will frustrated you as much as it frustrated everyone. Some are up to that challenge and some are not. I personally did not enjoy the lack of direction. I don't want it to hold my hand, but I'd like some hint or direction. I already go aimlessly through life, I don't need to do that in a game also",

Gameplay is about patience and perseverance... and multitudinous variations on the same type of puzzle. In some ways, it's a meditative experience, but it started to lose me about the time the puzzles themselves started moving and/or flashing different colors, literally giving me a headache. I'm not sure how players who are sensitive to flashing lights etc. would manage. I know I'm near the (first?) ending, and I would like to uncover some of the other secrets of the island eventually, but it may be a while before I revisit this.",

It's relentlessly cohesive and precise in a way rarely seen in games. The whole thing has an air of silent confidence, as if it knows it needs nothing more than what it presents to you to hold your attention, and it absolutely held mine. It builds and layers its concepts and rules in a way that were very engaging to play through and discover. The beautiful serene environments and quiet ambiance helped facilitate a focused flow of thought from puzzle to puzzle. It kicked my ass plenty of times, but I always came back. Even while away I'd find myself ruminating on possible solutions of whatever specific puzzle I was stuck on. If you like puzzle games, good games, or even just challenges, I'd highly recommend you play The Witness. Genuinely outstanding.",

They are generally hard and the solutions often come with pure observation of your surroundings and not just thinking. They are very varied and you'll never get bored of them.\nNo tutorial, the game makes you understand its mechanics through increasingly difficult puzzles in each zone and that's a good thing.\n\nThe visuals of the island are outstanding but as far as the story is concerned, there is none. Solving all the areas will unlock the final ones but you'll never get any context about the island, the statues or anything. There are just useless pretentious audio recordings hidden and that's all. They went for the funny true ending instead of creating a story so don't expect anything on this side.\n\nThere are also environmental puzzles. I suggest looking for them with a friend because there are lots of them, the island is rather big and they are sometimes well hidden.",

Plenty to distract you and you can eat up a long time looking for little things that just aren't in the spots where you are trying to look. All the more overt secret content is excellent, picking at the scraps is fruitless.\n\nOne of the best puzzle experiences I have had. I like the atmosphere a lot and I think the puzzles are really well crafted. I was really enamored with it for about half my playtime. I still liked it lots by the end but the shift from spending time working on puzzles to spending time looking for puzzles hurt the awe I felt so totally for the craft put into this game.\n\nWhen the game is good it is REALLY good. \n\nI felt very rewarded initially by my scrutiny of every object and location, leaving an amazing feeling. That same scrutiny eventually became disappointment at feeling obligated to comb holes in a tree canopy from every possible angle for the 5th time.",

        "review": "The Witness is exactly the game that gives the feeling of what it is like to uncover an understanding of something. It is messy, full of clever insight, unexpected turns, deadends, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I might say that this game is best to reflect how learning works. It is one that even the very mention of an idea could count as a spoiler because of how that often hints at some kind of solution. So any description of what the game is 'like' may probe your thought and for that reason I feel like one should go in blind. But I'll give some more description, just be warned.\n\nA puzzle game is, by definition, a game about a player faced with an interactive thing with some goal. The thing is, most puzzle games trace one level after another. You often feel like you are pounding your brain against a wall until you get it.\n\nThis leads to one major issue: a puzzle game is usually seen to test the mind. But the mind doesn't learn this way. By doing this rote style, it has one fatal, fatal flaw. When you are learning something by going over it again and again-you get more and more hard-wired to a certain way of old thinking that makes it more and more impossible to understand new things. The hard-wiring limits how you can expand off of. You can only learn when presented a variety of different, natural contexts.\n\nThe creator has a physics major and that shows-this isn't because of supreme intellect or fiendishly complicated mechanics. But because they show an understanding of how learning of deep subjects takes place, and that is by far a deeper insight of this game-learning how learning and understanding works. I have self-studied mathematics and physics for a while, preparing for college and what I noticed is the feeling of discovery here is very reminiscent of the experience\nof realizing something in math. This of course is applicable to anything you learn, a point emphasized throughout.\n\nThis game therefore takes a brilliant new approach-present a series of puzzles on an island in different sections with no pretension on what they 'should' know at a certain point. At first, you will come across a bunch of symbols and not know at all what they meme, it will incite a bit of wonder-especially due to the fresh environments and puzzle types around each corner. But you'll come across some path that, by the puzzles, work you through how one works and figure out a rule if you get through them. The rule won't ever be stated but you may think to figure something out and it may be subject to change. In this way, it is a metroidvania of ideas and knowledge.\n\nThe game is largely conceptual, it doesn't necessarily have a singularly tied 'rule', although the manners of the puzzle still tend to center on core ideas. Sometimes a puzzle is a bit more cryptic and not 'by the rules' you've think you've figured out by then. The game however gradually opens up you to more possibilities revolving around this 'rule' and this itself will set you in a mindset to open up. Because of its central focus around 'ideas', what often happens is you are wandering around and something completely unrelated probes an idea to try this out. It was itself not at all in the same problem category as what you were, yet it encouraged it.\n\nThis is exactly how learning works. This game actually promotes a sense of curiosity, wonder, frustration, and insight that feels so natural with how it really should work.\n\nSprinkled in between all that discovery though is what feels at core a deductive puzzle game, which helps test your abilities in that in a variety of ways, but there may be points where a singular puzzle you know the rule to but can't solve on its own merit may be a bit frustrating.\n\nThe world hints at something deeper although lore wise, despite an interesting aura of crypticism and philosophical themes, I don't think it goes much. There is however a later half I haven't really finished up but... oh I don't want to spoil.\n\nAs a final note, this is one of the games that made me really think about what games could be and one where I felt like it could truly be artistic, a power I didn't see before. It is one I was smiling so much at afterwards because of just... how cool it was.",

I haven't beat the game or found all the secrets or anything like that, but for whatever reason I can't being myself to launch the game again. The puzzle formula is solid. The lack of tutorial adds to the experience as you have to figure out what everything means. The lack of a hint button makes me not want to keep playing at times as even though I fully understand each puzzle mechanic, I can't visualize the solution and have to resort to looking up the solution when a push in the right direction would've sufficed. You might have more time with it than me, or maybe you'll have less. Who's to say.\n\n6.5/10. Was for me, then wasn't.",

I was actually too impatient that I used a guide to do it for most of it. I wish that I can go back in time and convince myself to not look up a guide, because this game really is a thinking game. You really have to be determined to go through excruciating pain to figure out what to do and what these do. \n\nThis game is timeless, and the graphics and scenery is just so beautiful that I really want to draw it at some point. I never got into the lore or deep things yet so maybe, I'll play this again with no guide :)",

I loved the completely open world aspect - you can go anywhere. It's so relaxed and self-paced, the only real confrontation is within your own mind. And that exactly how it was designed. I wish more players were patient enough to be immersed in the beauty of the intended purpose, the end goal of the entire story. 10/10 would recommend.",

By that I mean that the \"drawing lines on a screen\" is pretty much all you are going to do, which is a bit disappointing. There are different mechanics and twists to it, but it's still solely about the puzzles on the screens. In this way this game reminds of another game called \"Filament\" which has a similar issue.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous and strikes a perfect balance of difficulty right up until the \"endgame\" at which point it becomes a lot less fun. I spent like 25% of my total in-game time just at the last few puzzles. And the ending (won't spoil it) is also very underwhelming, and for some stupid reason resets your progress (loading an earlier auto-save is an option thankfully).\n\nOverall a good game, but I just want to reiterate - don't expect anything other than puzzles out of this one.",

As a puzzle enjoyer this is one of my favorite games \n\nBut if you want a story game with puzzles then it's just not it",

I wish you could opt out of all dialogue, as without the story this game is a beautiful game with puzzles that make you feel satisfied and clever. \n\nThere are few words in this game, which I greatly enjoy. It's best to go in with no information and no expectations.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzles like Sudoku and Minesweeper, you'll love this game. It's a bit more clever than those, but if those games frustrate you you'll likely be frustrated by this game as well.\n\nI enjoyed my stay on the island, it has the perfect amount of content, not too much nor little. I wouldn't regret paying full price for this game.",

Very frustrating and does nothing but waste time.\n\nDespite all these problems this game has to be one of my favorite puzzle games, it's very unique! The best part is figuring out what each new symbol does. I can recommend this game to anyone willing to deal with the minor problems this game has that also enjoys puzzle games.",

Anyone who plays games for lore to dive in and get lost in a new world of wonders such as myself, don't get this game. Going through, at first solving puzzles felt very rewarding, unlocking new areas and exploring more. But after opening the 20th door with no story coming, I quickly lost the satisfaction from solving these puzzles. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are absolutely beautiful, I made sure to get a lot of screenshots, but this is one of the only two reasons I've continued to play. The other reason was to finish the game to maybe see if any lore popped up. While it kind of looks like some did, it doesn't give any clear explanation or even something to think on. I still have yet to finish the second ending (if it does lead to a different ending at least) so if there is something story related there, I take back only a little of this review. Overall, the game play still does not feel rewarding or satisfying in the slightest.",

After staring at a puzzle we've been looking at for a minute we (eventually) see the solution that's been in front of us the entire time. That's the best part of The Witness.\n\nI think there's one or two tutorials and then the game wants you to figure out everything else by yourself It's a double edged sword since it either makes things more satisfying like a \"I figured this out all by myself\" feeling or incredibly frustrating like a \"How the hell was i suppose to figure that out?\" feeling. This could've been a simple puzzle game but i think the additions added make the game. If you do try this game do not play it like a video game. Take a step back and really pay attention. Take your time, Turn off your music or Youtube videos and really pay attention to everything these puzzles are trying to tell you.",

Not that there's anything wrong with this game, except perhaps the philosophical videos, of which the very first one is a very glaring logical contradiction. But maybe that's the point? Idk I've only seen the one. The puzzles are good, although I have to say there's a little too much fluff. You're never bottlenecked though so If you get stuck you can go try stuff somewhere else, which makes it harder to be frustrated. I think if you're considering buying this game, manage your expectations: this is not an exploration game with puzzles, this is puzzles with an artistic backdrop.",

I don't mean that in some sort of \"you must be a super smart\" way but more in the way that you need the patience of a saint and a serious drive to find rules and patterns where there seemingly aren't any. I played this game to varying degrees of \"completion\" over a long period of time, and I highly recommend taking breaks so as to not burn yourself out in this regard. \n\nAfter \"completing\" the game 100% (as far as the community knows as of now anyways), I can say that I greatly enjoyed The Witness and an overwhelming majority of its puzzles wholeheartedly. So many of them have clever solutions that felt rewarding to discover on my own. \nI found myself getting stumped quite often, but the \"aha\" moments feel so deserved and satisfying (*most of the time*) that I never felt compelled to search for solutions online just to progress. \n\nThe landscapes and aesthetics made exploring the world something to look forward to, and\nthe architectural design and its integration into the world makes every locale feel surreal and dream-like. :)\n\nOh! Also, can't believe it took so long to note this but the game is so pretentious! Wow! Uh, it doesn't change the puzzles, and I mean, I personally found it exciting to wi— *see*, if not just to see how pretentious it got. There are some genuinely very profound things you can take away from the game in my opinion, but I guess it just comes off a little silly when it seems to take itself so seriously all the time. (giggle emote) \nIf you like puzzle games with wonderful mysteries and challenging, clever challenges, you'll love this game like I did. \n\nPS: Sometimes the speed some of these transitions/animations happens at is inexcusable consider downloading Cheat Engine or equivalent software to speed up the game with a hotkey. Unless if you enjoy the wonderful puzzle of staring with nothing to do at things you've seen already! <3 \n\nPPS: I actually wrote this review during something unskippable with a tremendous time requirement, so maybe this is all part of the developers' plan?!?!",

Whoever worked on this took great pride in their work. \n\nThe Witness is a certifiable monkey gym for your mind. Fortunately, I do not suffer from a completionist compulsion. I imagine that I would have felt frustrated if I did. \n\nYou can finish the game while \"leaving thing undone\". There's a layer to this game that is always present, and always alluring. I very much appreciate that it is there. It's what makes The Witness so great. \n\nStill, .. I'm not inclined to scrape the bottom of that layer to get every drop of juice out of it. I got what I needed, and am happy to know that there is more should I want it. It feels better to leave it there. I think that's what the point was. That there's something left to find, should I really want to search more.\n\nI hope you can play the game without feeling like you have to find everything. The game does not want you to feel that way\n\nTechnically: This game runs at over 60 fps on my 21:9 Ultrawide monitor, on max settings. It is very well optimized, has zero bugs (in the 60+ hours that I played). I am playing on  laptop with gtx 1650ti.\n\nThe game loads almost instantly. You don't have to click through any menus or intros. You just go straight to where you left of. Exiting the game also happens instantly. <-- These are things that I personally appreciate enormously.",

        "review": "Pretentious and with poor puzzles. The puzzles are all of the same design with slightly varied rulesets: You have a beautiful environment and walk from place to place, staring at screens where you draw lines. Some puzzles are \"environmental\" but this means you hunt around for the right angle for a tree to cast a shadow on the screen, revealing the right path, or the right angle from which to view/touch the screen. This isn't logical and doesn't fit with how this is presented: As electronic screens, not optical illusions. The logic of the game is obtuse yet it clearly thinks it is some master stroke. Vastly overrated and I cannot recommend it all.",

        "review": "I think it's my favorite puzzle game.  Watching those philosophical videos that play after completing the puzzles in the theater room is perhaps the most mystifying experience of my life.  It makes puzzle-solving aspects of almost every other game that I've ever played seem really juvenile and pointless.  The puzzles here can get really hard too.  I think the only reason I even solved some of these puzzles is b/c I was really determined, due solely to how it made me feel like it could answer cosmological questions if I finished it - that's how powerful those videos are.  I needed to solve them all.  There are clues all over the island like keys, and when you enter them correctly onto a panel in front of a screen underground, videos play.  You can even interact with some of them in unique, mind-bending ways.  It made me feel like I was on shrooms at times.  That being said, if I encountered some of these puzzles in the middle of another game I might have just said, \"screw it, I can't do it\" b/c some are really that hard.  Some might see that as a drawback.  The only drawback I see is that some puzzles truly are terrible and some are way too easy, but these could mostly be overlooked without too much difficulty.\n\nDon't get the wrong idea.  It isn't going to convert any nihilists into spiritual philosophers, it simply might give you the hope or belief that it might, eventually, if only you solve more puzzles.  Of course it never does, but this game can't be blamed for the pointlessness and simplicity of existence.  It also can't be blamed for its lack of answers that just don't exist.  The pursuit of those answers though, and the struggle through these puzzles, is a great experience on its own, if you don't mind being disappointed by the ending.  But that's life as well, as much as you might like to deny.",

        "review": "The Witness is simultaneously impressive, clever, tedious & terrible. The problem is that you get an  uneven experience when you combine all those things together. There are times when the game pleasantly hums along, but other times when it drags for long periods.\n\nYou start out in a somewhat restricted area, but once you pass this area, you're set loose on a semi-large open world island. You will find & solve puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. These are all line/maze puzzles (so you better enjoy those, as there are around 650 in the game). The island has various areas often containing series of puzzles unique to that area as well as some shared ones. The final puzzle in an area will open a yellow box which shoots a laser to the top of a mountain. You need to activate at least 7 of the 11 lasers on the island to get to the end game area, where you'll then proceed to hit some of the more annoying puzzles in the game.\n\nTo start with the list of issues is that the game implies that there is some grand mystery as to what is going on here. There isn't. In fact, there's no plot/story. The most you'll find are tape recorders containing pretentious nonsense. This ends with you being sent back to where you started and the puzzles all being reset. The secret ending is some guy wakes up in reality, falls over a bunch, touches some things and then taps some stuff with a spoon. Amazing!\n\nThere is no hand holding for the puzzles in this. The starting puzzles are tracing a line through the maze to the end. After this, you'll find puzzles with black & white dots, colored dots, small black hexagons, tetris shapes, sunburst symbols, etc. Some areas have short tutorial segments that teach you the basic rules for one of the rule sets. You will run into puzzles you're not currently able to solve, forcing you to go elsewhere. Most of this is fine except for the fact that the island takes a bit to get around and there is no map (except on the boat which functions as a sort of quicktravel system, except it's slower than running to your destination). The only real use for the boat is to get to one island which is separated from the main island.\n\nThe game has several issues with the areas and puzzles. It's difficult to talk about them as doing so provides minor spoilers. While you're often shown basic rules for puzzles, many of them have more advanced rules, which are completely reliant on you to figure out. Some of these require a bit of a stretch on your part. Some puzzles are based on visuals/sounds and even these will often require you to make a leap. If you fail some puzzles, the screen for that puzzle will turn off, forcing you to go back to a previous puzzle and re-solve it to get the screen to turn back on. These are usually ones based on you needing to notice something. The desert area is entirely based on luck as to whether you'll figure out how to solve the puzzles in that area. [spoiler]The solution for the puzzles only appear if you stand in certain spots, causing the sun to hit the screen in a way that it shows you how to draw the answer.[/spoiler] There was one area in the game (the jungle) where I was unable to start solving the puzzles because of stuff like this.\n\nThe worst puzzles in the game by far are the ones involving the tetris shapes, of which there are many. These don't start off too bad in the area you learn them, but you'll find plenty of puzzles which contain 3, 4, 5+ of these shapes on them. These aren't so much difficult as they're time consuming, requiring you to run through pretty much every possible permutation until you happen to stumble across the right one.\n\nThe environment also contains puzzles. Fortunately, these are all optional. If something in the environment looks like a circle (or can be combined/viewed to make it look like a circle), odds are pretty good it's a puzzle of some sort. The swamp area can be very annoying as it contains moving platforms which take a good 30+ seconds to very slowly move back and forth so you can get from one side to the other.\n\nThe Witness is an alright but uneven game. Sometimes you're going through puzzles at a good pace, other times you're stuck on one for a long while or have to go to some other area because you can't figure it out. Some puzzles make you feel smart when you figure out whatever the rule is or notice whatever it is you needed to notice. Other puzzles you'll know the rules, but are time consuming annoyances requiring you to try to fit things together in a ton of possible ways until you happen to find the one that actually works. Ultimately, the Witness goes on for far too long for what it is. The number of puzzles could've been cut in half and the game would've been far better off for it. It would've also helped to cut the time consuming brute force 4+ tetris piece puzzles.",

I got to the end with only very slight help on a couple puzzles, and there are a TON of puzzles in this game that can get pretty ridiculous at times. Probably too many iterations on each with too few changes.\n\nThe game also tells you absolutely nothing. You must work out every little rule on your own and often will come to wrong conclusions. It's really bad at directing you in any way about that and you can waste a loooong time going down the wrong rabbit hole of a theory.\n\nUltimately, although there are some very cleverly designed puzzles, more often than not you feel relieved to be done with a puzzle rather than satisfied by solving it and it can be a very frustrating experience that the world design doesn't help by making it a sluggish pain to get around. That said, I believe that all is by design and although I don't think it was a good choice, if you are in the mood for a devious puzzle game with a slow pace and don't want your hand held in the slightest, this may be the right game for you. \n\nI cautiously recommend it in that case.",

        "review": "The first time I played through this game, I did not enjoy it and I gave up long before I reached the end. However, I revisited this game recently and despite expecting to be disappointed again, I actually found myself having a very fun time with this game. There are some very serious flaws with this game though and I think some of these flaws help explain my vastly different experiences with this game.\n\nOne of the largest flaws in this game for me was the story, or the lack thereof. There was so little narrative in this game that for most of my playthrough I honestly thought there wasn't supposed to be one, despite what the store page seems to suggest. What little story does exist is all locked behind hidden content near the end of the game and it's fairly brief and not well communicated, so even when I did finally encounter it, I found it pretty underwhelming and disappointing. There are also random thoughts from various philosophical thinkers hidden around the map to listen to as well, which don't provide any narrative, but do provide some interesting perspectives to consider, although I did sometimes find them hard to follow, especially while trying to explore or solve puzzles at the same time, and those that don't enjoy philosophy likely won't get much out of them.\n\nThe very creative puzzles that exist throughout the island of The Witness are where this game really shines. The general concept is fairly simple, and involves tracing a line through a maze from a start point to an end point, but the game quickly begins introducing a plethora of unique and interesting additional mechanics and rules, many of them making creative use of the environment to help you solve them. For the most part the game does pretty well at introducing new concepts to you with puzzles that gradually increase in difficulty in different areas, and the game does encourage you to revisit puzzles later if you don't have all the information you need to solve one. There were a few puzzles that were not communicated well or had unintuitive rules that were easy to forget, there's a few that are insanely slow or tedious to solve, and I also didn't enjoy some of the puzzles near the end of the game that relied on some annoying visual tricks that just made them really hard to look at (epilepsy warning for some of those puzzles as well). Thankfully those puzzles were by far the minority.\n\nIn addition to the regular puzzle panels that you find everywhere, there are hidden [spoiler]environmental puzzles[/spoiler] that are cleverly hidden throughout the island. These puzzles were my favourite puzzles to solve and I really enjoyed hunting for them and trying to figure out how to solve them. However, this brings me back to my first playthrough that I really didn't enjoy, as I never discovered these puzzles during that playthrough, and I think that highlights another major problem with this game. The open world nature of this game means you can easily miss things and end up missing crucial information on how to solve puzzles or even that some puzzles exist, leading to frustration or missing large parts of the game entirely. I think I just ended up doing things in a different order during my first playthrough and that resulted in me having a much worse experience. I think this game could have used more guidance to instruct players on where to go, or at least to indicate where good places to start are, as the freedom the game offers can definitely result in a worse experience overall.\n\nThe visuals in this game a very good. The island looks great and the sound design is very good as well. There's also many neat tricks of perspective hidden throughout the island, where looking at something from a certain angle reveals something neat you wouldn't have otherwise seen, which were pretty cool. The game also ran well and I didn't encounter any major issues during my playthroughs.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a fun puzzle game with a simple concept that is used in a large number of interesting and creative ways and a visually and auditorily stunning world to solve them in. Despite some puzzles that were poorly explained, tedious, or visually nauseating, a lack of direction which can sometimes lead to frustration, and an almost complete lack of narrative, I still enjoyed this game (the second time at least). This game definitely isn't for everyone, but if you like first-person puzzle games, I'd still recommend giving this game a try if you can get it on sale, as I think it gets more right than it gets wrong.",

However, it is FAR too easy to develop misconceptions of the rules, or to learn rules out of sequence in a way that allows you to accidentally complete puzzles and fulfil rules that you are unaware of until you hit a wall that just makes no sense. Additionally, some puzzles require you to interpret things in a way that it is extremely rare to do. (This is NOT a bad thing usually, but it is a such a specific way or ordering/ranking sounds for the ship and bird puzzles that I genuinely do not understand why the correct solutions I brute-forced were correct)\nThe best moments that game has is the environmental puzzles, which in my opinion are absolute genius. The colour puzzle in the crate in the village  (Which [i]the[/i] witness endgame located directly next to the start of the game) opened my eyes as to how the colour puzzles actually worked.\nIt also doesn't help that The Witness is one of the most pretentious games I have ever played, even including a half hour philosophy lecture required to 100% the game.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a very smart game, but I just didn't find it fun.",

Pero sí es el más difcil que he jugado, el nivel de dificultad es muy elevado, mucho más complicado que los dos que mencioné anteriormente. Sin embargo,  el juego no tiene significado, ni personajes interesantes, ni hisotria, ni nada, son sólo un montón de puzzles random que hay que resolver. Cualquier significado que se le haya intentado dar a este juego queda en nada devido a lo absurdamente abstracto y rídiculamente dificil que es. Aún así debido a su orignialidad y dificultad sí lo recomiendo. Muy buen juego",

This time I grabbed a guide 15 minutes in and it made the experience bearable.  \n\nThe level design is awesome, and the island is beautiful.  Time spent exploring was great.  The sound in some areas, like the shipwreck, is really good.  Even the puzzle concepts for unlocking and traversing the world were cool, just not the puzzles themselves.  \n\nThe \"story\"...  I mean this game doesn't need a story, and I've played a ton of walking simulators and indie concept games so I get it, but wow is this one pretentious.  Seemingly random intellectual and philosophical quotes that remind me of Civ when you unlock a tech or build a world wonder, except with zero context.  There are some secret videos available that are sort of interesting, but they range from clips of foreign films to narrated stories to portions of 70's science specials and appear to have absolutely nothing to do with anything.  I think the devs just tried way too hard to be profound.  \n\nIf you can get past the tedium of hundreds of line puzzles and you're not colorblind, hearing impaired, or epileptic, it's an alright game to go through, but in no world is it worth $40.",

        "review": "Best, most difficult, and most innovative puzzle game I've ever played. Better than Myst, Riven, Exile, Revelation, Obduction, Quern, the Talos Principle, you name it. Interacting with the puzzles is so simple, and although every puzzle is the same maze-like grid, the dozens of variations make sure that the puzzles never feel stale. Plus, the open world means that if you get sick of a particular type of puzzle, you're not stuck forever until you do it; you can just move onto something else.\n\nThe game sets you free in a huge, beautiful open world full of puzzles and interesting locations. There are no explicit tutorials, but every new variation of the mazes has its own \"training zone\" which starts you off with some easy puzzles to let you learn what the new symbols/colors mean. It does require some guess and check, but personally I love this method of teaching. Very hands-off, very indirect, but I think extremely effective. Once you've learned the rules, the puzzles are yours to do however you choose. There is no order in which you have to visit the different locations, but in most locations the puzzles have to be done in a specific order. Again though, variation and clever tricks keep the puzzles feeling fresh even if they use the same rules.\n\nThe puzzles also grow ever more intertwined with the environment as you progress to more difficult areas. In some areas solving puzzles moves machinery, in some you physically have to walk the maze to solve it, in some you have to use shadows or light or sound, etc. Trust me, making the connection between what's happening around you and the solution to the puzzle you're looking at never stops being satisfying. The amount of creativity required to take the simple concept of a maze and turn it into dozens of unique ideas and hundreds of unique puzzles is astounding. Hence the \"best, most difficult, and most innovative puzzle game I've ever played.\"\n\nHowever, if you're looking for story there's really nothing here. The environment is rife with little details and trying to piece together the story through sheer exploration is fun, but there's really nothing cohesive beyond that. Worst of all there are audio recording scattered throughout the environment that play random quotes from historical figures which cannot be stopped once they are started, and some of which are painfully long. If you're looking for an engaging story with exposition, climax, and resolution, you won't find it here. And for the love of god do NOT touch the audio recordings; they're just distracting.\n\nThat being said, there is a secret ending (I'm guessing, based on the hidden achievement and the fact that I finished the game without doing all of the puzzles) which might shed more light on the story. If I ever get the secret ending I'll update this review, but the game appears to have completely reset once I finished it, so that might not happen.\n\nIn short, beautiful, challenging, innovative, but sparse of story. If you want to test yourself against some of the most difficult and innovative puzzles you've ever encountered surrounded by colorful scenery, this is a must-play. If you want to uncover the mystery of a story-rich world with some low-stakes brain-teasers, maybe try a different game. 9/10",

        "review": "The Witness is certainly a strikingly beautiful game, but among the stunningly colourful artistic backdrop lies what is quite an underwhelming and rather frustrating puzzle experience that fails to intrigue or captivate. \n\nYou wake up alone on an island where there is no music or other people, yet the landscape is littered with these maze-like panel puzzles. Your only option is to solve therm and see what unfolds. That's pretty much it really.\n\nThe Puzzles themselves are either ridiculously easy, incredibly frustrating or downright illogical. There isn't much satisfaction to be had either and moving onto the next batch doesn't really bring much excitement. \n\nThis game lacks the intrigue of The Outer Wilds, the variety of The Talos Principle and the brilliance of Portal. Take away the island all all you've got is a load of puzzles you'd likely see in these indie games that go for £1.49.\n\n",

And a side note about puzzles: If you're dyslexic you may want to pass on this one. For example, I found myself struggling once i had to memorize the orientation 5 different tetris pieces plus negations while repositioning them on the board. Then do it 10 times in a row.   \n\nThe scenery isn't bad. The lack of constant noise is peaceful at times. I especially liked the boat for this reason.\n\nWhat ruined it for me was the subject matter. It is a bit much for how little there is. Its like that kid in high school that read a thesaurus so they could sound smarter than everyone... and just ended up on a very wordy path to mediocrity. This is metaphorically speaking of course, as there is almost no talking.\n\nUltimately I'd give it a \"meh\" if there was an option to do that.",

I've played it through a few times and I still don't understand quite what the point is- You do all of these hundreds of line puzzles and [Spoilers] you get in an elevator and watch all of it undo itself.\nI think The Witness is fantastic- not just because of its puzzles but because it really is a nice-looking game- but the only problem is that you can only really get into it if you're willing to play for hours and hours, not all in one sitting, but spread out- If you just can't solve something the best course of action is to spend a half hour or so doing something else. So you spend ten minutes of productivity solving puzzles, then twenty minutes of puzzling over one grid that seems to have NO ANSWER, then you give up and take a break for a while, and then you come back 30 minutes later and you solve it in a quarter of a second, and then you spend five minutes wondering how you didn't think of that before. So if you don't happen to be in the correct puzzle-solving, open-thinking mindset, you won't be able to make much progress.\nThe Witness is just a game that is really unusual. There are other puzzle games, but I haven't yet seen one puzzle game that takes a single puzzle to such an extent as The Witness does.\nSo as long as you're okay with spending forty dollars on it, and as long as you're prepared to take a lot of rests and be very open-minded and calm, go ahead.",

But it will be spiratual, and if you really connect those last brain cells of ours, it might make you think.\nOverall, good puzzle game.
