The movement is floaty and imprecise, which makes what would otherwise probably be fun platforming sequences brutal and tiresome, and combat is mostly mindless button pressing, but still extremely difficult (due mostly to the aforementioned movement, which in addition to being floaty and imprecise, lacks any dodging abilities until late in the game). I think light burst is one of the most worthless abilities in any game I've ever played, fortunately you only find it late game in an optional area. The zoomed-out/world map, while it might look nice, does not meaningfully represent actual playable areas and is difficult to interpret.\n\nEdit: Finally fully completed the game, and it does have an incredible, heartwarming story. I still don't think it's worth suffering through the gameplay, though.",

So it gets a pass on most fronts.\nSo yes, definitely not a perfect game, but certainly a very, very good one.",

        "review": "I really wanted to like this game. The reviews were great, the trailer looked gorgeous, and the story sounded intriguing. I picked it up when it went on sale for dirt cheap (I'm a broke university student mom with four kids, so I don't get to buy new games very often.).\n\nUnfortunately, the game ended up being exactly what I hate when it comes to actual mechanics. It's an incredibly picky, button-mashing platformer. On top of that, Ori's actions aren't always predictable. Sometimes, when I hit \"A,\" they'd do a simple jump and hit the mark. Sometimes, they'd do a weird little somersault and miss (I didn't have double jump, yet.). At times, they'd slide down a wall instead of sticking, double-jump when I only hit the key once. It was frustrating to no end. It did this with both my keyboard and my controller. \n\nI played for several hours and it was mostly spent repeating the same spot over and over and over while I tried to hit the key sequence *just right* so that Ori would bounce up a series of walls. I finally deleted the game when I tried one area, no joke, fifty times. It's that difficult. If you like this kind of gameplay, that's great and you'll love this. I do not. I don't have much time to play and wasting it like this when I could be exploring the actual world is not enjoyable at all. \n\nThere were no great discoveries or puzzles to solve during this time. You'd find locked gates, but....surprise! The key is just hidden in a little corner. You literally run into it. No mystery there. I love puzzles and would have liked to have seen more development here.\n\nThe artistic style is absolutely adorable and gorgeously crafted. It makes you wish you could actually run through this forest. If Ori was a stuffed animal, they'd be perched on my bed as we speak. Additionally, the enemies are creative and well-matched for Ori's abilities. If this had a little more depth and a little less \"hit this spot exactly right,\" I'd have loved it, even if it made the gameplay itself more difficult.",

But I want to be, you know, entertained by a game, not spend my off hours grinding some more.\r\n\r\nI played the game on Easy mode and it was still bullshit - if they give us an easy mode it should actually be EASY imo. The masochists can play on hard mode and brag about it - where's the option for us casuals?",

        "review": "Ori is a beautiful game with a cute story, stunning graphics, and very well-crafted gameplay. Traversing the game world is simply fun and engaging, even though the story is relatively short.\n\n[h2]Achievements[/h2]\n[b]Required time:[/b] 20-30 hours\n[b]Difficulty (in my opinion):[/b] 9 out of 10 (if done legit)\n\nWorking through the achievement list is really fun and, aside from one achievement, relatively straightforward. You’ll need to collect all the game’s collectibles and reveal 100% of the map, which is no problem with a guide and can actually be enjoyable. There are also a few miscellaneous achievements, and you’ll need to complete the game in under 3 hours and without acquiring new skills—these two can be combined pretty well. The real challenge, however, is the One Life difficulty, where you must complete the entire game without dying even once. This is extremely difficult and requires an insane amount of patience, especially since the game can occasionally throw some bs moments your way. If you go for it legitimately, it’s a serious test of skill—but there are tricks to make it a bit easier ^^",

        "review": "Ori and the Blind Forest hides a fist of steel in an emerald satin glove\n\nThe first thing Ori and the Blind Forest hits you with is water colored beauty frosted with golden morning light. I spent at least a minute gazing in wonder at the title screen. Yes, really.\n\nA click on the “Start new game” button later, Ori and the Blind Forest tells the tale of Ori himself in a semi-interactive intro sequence that gives even the first ten minutes of “Up” a run for its poignancy money. \n\nJust a few minutes after that, odds are that the game will kill you for the first time. Because while Ori and the Blind Forest might look like a children’s game, when it comes to challenge, it does not screw around.\n\nThe likely killer isn’t even one of the cutely corrupted forest animals opposing Ori’s progression, it’s Mother Nature itself with its drowning floods, burning fires, endless chasms and especially its thrice-damned brambles and thorn bushes that pop Ori like he’s a balloon. You will die when a jump is too short. You will die when a jump is too high. You will die when after a harrowing sequence of flawlessly executed actions the very last button hit came a bit too late or too early. These are the deaths that result in teeth marks left in the controller. \n\nAnd yet, despite the high level of death-related frustration, I never felt any inclination to walk away from this 2D metroidvania. Partly because the titular Blind Forest is so jaw-droppingly gorgeous, with its greens and purples and violets, with its moody shadows and glorious sunlight, with all those lovingly crafted little animations and artistic touches. Partly because I was invested in helping Ori through his hero arc. But mostly because playing was so much fun mostly because one primary feeling the game inspires: momentum. \n\nWhen Ori isn’t busy bleeding out on another bloody thorn, the slightest button prompt makes him glide through the level like a leaf on an especially cineastic breeze.  Double jump, dash and glide allow for movement chains that don’t touch the ground for 10 seconds or more. Playing Ori is simply delightful. \n\nNot every moment I spent with the game was quite as wonderful. There are a few brutal difficulty spikes that surpassed even the already high base level of PC mortality. The lack of enemy variety hurts the game a bit, as does the strange checkpoint system that allows the player himself to determine where he would like a checkpoint to be. The problem is that you pay for the position of a checkpoint with a resource you might run out of, which allows the player to completely screw himself, especially since Ori’s stronger attacks consume the same resource. Next time, please take that particular freedom away from me again. \n\nAs I got better at the game and Ori got his paws on quite a few life bar extensions, the engagement curve smoothed out and the rage-inducing instakills became quite rare. Ori is the rare game where the last third is actually the most fun. The story wraps itself up in a bittersweet  finale with a hopeful denouement, and then you are free to fly through the entire map like lightning, hovering up the last collectibles to your heart’s content and finally, leave the game and immediately install its sequel. Ori and the Blind Forest might be a harsh mistress, but she has a lot of joy to give, as well.\n\nTLDR: A charismatic metroidvania with beautiful art, a world class movement system and a charmingly simple and evocative story. Just be aware that it will kill you. A lot.",

        "review": "I don't normally write reviews on games often, and that's mainly due to me liking to keep my opinions to myself, but y'all. Let me tell you a little something.\r\n\r\nMetroidvanias are in a weird spot for me. I will either play the game for hours on end due to how addicted I am to it (Hollow Knight is a very good example of this), or I will not be interested in it at all. The Ori franchise has always been on my radar due to my general liking of fantastical scenery and mystical things, but never really put the time nor money aside to give it a proper shot. I've heard from close friends how good the game was, but it was only just recently I finally pulled the trigger on the series (since it has a bundle deal to get both The Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps for a really good price).\r\n\r\nY,all. I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT THIS WHOLE TIME.\r\n\r\nIf a game has me fantasizing the experience and setting of the game AFTER I have finished playing it (whether it be to take a break or after completing the story), that says something, and Moon Studios absolutely nailed it with this game. A fluid movement system for Ori (the character you play as), a cohesive combat system that allows you to pair some abilities together at the same time, and a map that consistently challenges you to use your wits and be alert to your surroundings, while also being intertwined in a way that's satisfying.\r\n\r\nTo be honest with you, I would love to see more attention to detail on the lore aspect of this universe, such as where did Kuro come from, or how the Spirit tree was formed (honestly, if this was already stated within the game, then I'm just being a dense mfer per usual).\r\n\r\nAnd the music? ABSOLUTELY BLISSFUL. I don't think I've had any other game hit me with any sort of emotions unlike this. With suspenseful transitions and pure ambience for each location, the music seriously hit every single note right (get it...?), and the people behind the sound design and coordinating the OSTs know exactly what they're doing (and it's honestly a big inspiration for me to understand composition as a whole).\r\n\r\nTo end this, how can I rate this game?\r\n\r\n9.5/10\r\n\r\nEverything this game has to offer is nearly perfect and works amazingly with each other, and I think any player, new or experienced in Metroidvanias, can have an awesome time with this game. However, if more can be done to expand the lore/universe, this will easily be a 10/10 (albeit this game is already one of my personal favorites as of recent years).",

        "review": "Setting aside the controversial articles surrounding the work atmosphere at Moon Studios, I'm going to solely focus on the game: you know how many people feel when they wake up on Christmas morning (or another equivalent holiday)? It's warm in the house, you have your favourite sweater on, and your fluffy childhood socks that maybe your grandma knitted or you bought from a winter bazaar, and it's snowing outside, you stretch in your bed, go to the kitchen and make yourself a cup of steamy hot cocoa or hot chocolate, and take a sip. And you just sit there inhaling everything around you. You smile. Life is simple. You're happy. This is what Ori and the Blind Forest feels like. The music is how I imagine the word tranquility would sound. If you've ever played WoW, the druid class has a spell called Tranquility, can't describe it better. The artwork is spectacular, I love it! There are some maddening sections in the game, I must admit that but after a couple (of dozen) attempts you get the hang of it. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed the time I spent going on an adventure with Ori in the Blind Forest. 10/10 would recommend if you're a fan of the genre. Happy exploring, folks!",

(this is kind of a given for metroidvania's though)\r\n- Amazing graphics\r\nThe graphics of this game are still breath taking even though its old it won't be 4K raytraced quality but it looks amazing nonetheless\r\n\r\nNegatives\r\n- Punishing gameplay\r\nCertain parts of the game are extremely punishing and unfair\r\nif you're playing on hardcore this isn't a issue however if you are it's a huge issue\r\n- 100% map exploration is tedious\r\nWhile 100%'ing a game is never a easy task with ori there are scenarios where you will sometimes miss a slight spot and its impossible to see this on the map as such you have to walk circles to find it\r\nThis can be annoying as you will be running the same area 12 times before finding that one spot you needed to find\r\n- Easy combat\r\nYou don't have any crazy weapon's and the likes as such you will often be sitting there pressing a button until the enemy dies. This isn't bad but if your a person that likes intense combat you may have to make it more intense yourself by doing funny tricks",

The level design is clever with lots of nooks and crannies with hidden goodies.\r\nThis is a great first game for people with little or no metroidvania experience. Its relativity short, has fluid controls and the combat is not too strenuous.\r\nI can, with no hesitation, recommend this game.",

        "review": "Ori drew me in with its beautiful narration at the start of its game, beautiful art style, and friends recommending me to play it. It has a lovely story with cinematic presentation, but the gameplay / presentation is a bit disappointing in comparison:\r\n\r\nThroughout the game, you ALWAYS run away from something. Run out of temples after restoring them, run away from natural disasters, run away from the angry bird - in theory, this wouldn't be a problem. However, the realization after the third escape sequence made me realize that the game felt way too repetitive. I wished escaping could at least feel different, but it didn't. It always felt the same, over and over again.\r\n\r\nI thought the skill tree was interesting. It having requirements helped balance out from capping out one aspect disproportionately seemed alright. Though the combat itself was pretty sad. For most of the game, you're fighting the same enemies rehashed with a slightly more powerful projectiles and more health to tank more hits. It also gets stale.\r\n\r\nYou can raise your maximum HP, but then the enemies and the environment proportionately harm you more than before. This would be fine, but in practice makes it so you never can tank more hits or mistakes from anything. It just feels like you're not making any progress as a player. \r\n\r\nAll of this together makes for an experience that feels very frozen in time. It never feels like you make progress, it always feels like you're doing the same thing, and not even the combat changes. Also, at times puzzles seemed to make me get stuck for obnoxiously long periods of time. Then, when I look it up, it turns out that majority of other players were stuck in the exact same place makes it feel less my fault and more the game failing to properly indicate me what to do.\r\n\r\nOri and the Blind Forest, for me personally, is the bane of my existence. I cannot hide how much frustration and hatred this game made me feel. Objectively, it's an alright game. Just painfully boring gameplay-wise... puzzles can be alright. But randomly stumbling into the ending without realizing that was the finale of the game was really.. disappointing. Love the art style, characters, and story. The gameplay just made me feel really apathetic about the whole thing. Wouldn't recommend the game unless you're really invested in the story and world building.",

As far as gameplay goes (and this comes from someone that really dislikes platformer type games) it is pretty solid. The puzzles are fun and not super hard, the platforming and moving around is generally enjoyable, especially the \"boos fight\" escapes. There are some parts that got me frustrated, but then again, not a huge fan of platfoermers. \n\nOverall, I'd give Ori and the Blind Forest a solid 9/10 and I will definitely be revisiting again at some point in the future.",

Every failure feels like a change to improve/progress and the game builds off that in a really amazing way.

        "review": "A bit disappointing. Do not misunderstand, [i]Ori[/i] is not a [i]bad[/i] game at all. It is quite beautiful in both art style, actual visuals, soundtrack… it all comes together nicely. What disappoints is how utterly banal it all ends up being. A story that tries very hard to be the indie 101 with a child character lost in a scary world alongside a somber soundtrack, but unlike, say, [i]Ender Lilies[/i], I cannot say I ever cared for this one. Not only does the narrative destroy all sense of gravitas it had towards the end and turned excessively formulaic, I found the gameplay stood in the way of the narrative entirely too much.\r\nGameplay is an interesting one here. After dealing with the Ginso Tree I felt the game came into its own, as most movement options (notably the very cool bash) are now available and controls stopped feeling awkward, turning traversal from chore to joy. A curious development that I felt again on successive playthroughs and thus also highlights Ori’s own growth. If I see [i]Ori[/i] more as a platformer than a metroidvania, my view certainly becomes more favorable, however, the platforming never came into its own for me. It seems as if all the game knows are spikes and instant kill lasers. The spikes in particular feel egregious in some places where due to yet underdeveloped movement options, the game asks you to make precise jumps up cliffs with the spikes jutting out just a few more pixels than it seems, which combined with the rather floaty controls never stopped feeling like cheap hits. Those felt particularly awful when I went for the one life difficulty. And then you get all these cool movement options and the game does what with it? Tunnels of spikes and/or lasers. Glide through the tunnel of spikes. Glide through the tunnel but stop just before the laser gets you and pass it quickly when it pauses. It got old quickly, whereas some of the parts that I found more interesting, like bashing rocks through wind passages to make barriers were comparatively rare. Not like those were grand revelations in game design, but it felt much better than maneuvering around yet more spikes. And then there are the escape sequences, which are technically amazing – the tense music, how you are in a rush and… oh, you did not know the path because this is your first time? Too bad, now have fun dying every step along the way because you did not know that the ceiling crushes you if go too far. No, you cannot outspeed the water, it rubberbands right back to you, now enjoy having missed the timing by a few frames and starting over yet again, music and all. It is not hard, but tedious. Gameplay and narrative were so massively at odds with each other here that I just grew apathetic to these supposedly (in)tense situations. I guess there is also the combat. Um. It is supremely bad and the game would have been better off without it, which would have aided it in the visual clarity department as well, as I found the variety of glowing blobs (including yourself) to be beyond annoying to read well.\r\nFor the most part, I did enjoy the game nonetheless, particularly how you can break some sequences or just be creative with throwing light balls to make your own bashing points. And while that felt amazing, I was overall not too impressed with [i]Ori[/i]. It might just be that while I have finally gotten around to playing it, it is just too late now, almost ten years later. Particularly so after I have played both [i]Hollow Knight[/i] and [i]Celeste[/i], which might be a bit of an unfair comparison but to me they highlight the weaknesses of both the metroidvania and platforming elements so much more.",

Mechanically, it does start a little shallow, but as you unlock more abilities, movement becomes a lot more fluid and expressive. There are some occasional \"cheap\" deaths, but being able to make save points pretty much whenever you want keeps it from being frustrating when they happen. Definitely recommend to almost anyone; I think this game has pretty broad appeal",

It requires fast reflexes and precise platforming. That being said, it is a gem in what it seeks to achieve.\n\nWhile the art style of Ori is the star of the show, the level design and ability mechanics keep things interesting as well. The metroidvania aspect of the game also means that those who like being completionists can get even more playtime out of the game by going back to old regions and discovering secret locations or areas that were earlier locked. I also enjoyed the fact that there is no real spoken language in the game, and even if you don't read the little text that they do show on-screen, the story is strongly portrayed just through visuals.\n\nThe only parts that frustrated me a little were the \"escape\" sequences where you are expected get through an entire section at once without making any mistakes. These portions tend to be more 'trial and error' than puzzle or skill based, but they are few and far between, so it is forgivable.",

The game doesn't feel unfairly hard- if I make a mistake and die, I can easily understand why it happened and how i should start fixing the issue. The story is emotional despite not having any dialogue, and though it's perhaps not the most unique, it's still full of potential as a heartwarmer and tearjerker both.\n\nThe \"boss\" battles of the game are intense chase sequences which test your mastery of new abilities, and they're full of a healthy adrenaline. Unfortunately, some parts can have /very/ steep reaction time requirements, and it can sometimes feel like you're intended to die as a learning experience and start over, instead of escaping by the skin of your teeth. This interruption of flow can be very jarring!\n\nThe music and the art, are, of course, top notch, and I don't think there's a single moment in the game that looks or sounds bad.",

        "review": "Not a recommended despite the game's quality in animation and overall artistic direction. I heard the story was majestic but I just found it good, not more.\r\nWhat frustrated me the most were the controls and after playing games like Hollow Knight, it feels very frustrating coming back to Ori and having to push 4 different buttons to do the equivalent of the crystal dash. \r\nAlso, the game seems unfair at times, putting some segments closer to die n retry than actual skilled platforming, making it very frustrating.\r\nFinally, the difficulty is a bit problematic. My fault in a way, as I always play my games on Hard or Very Hard for a challenge. Here, I oscillated between pure skill and unfairness, frustrating me even further when i realized that some end game enemies were one shotting me, although I had all optional Life Cells. \r\n\r\nSo... here we are. This is not recommended but I didn't hate it. It's a shame to see such majestic artistic direction in an often frustrating game. Didn't play Ori 2 but I hope It's better because there's a great potential.",

That was weird.\n\nEasy recommend for those who like vibrant, colorful games that encourage you to explore; people seeking simple stories that will punch you in the feels; platformers that increment difficulty consistently across new areas (with the possible exception of Mount Horu ;-) ). Two thumbs up, call it an 8/10 for the numbers oriented crowd.\n\nedit: changed 'said' to 'sad' in the sentence beginning with, \"Sad, but not as sad as...\"",

        "review": "[h3]Exploration: 4/5[/h3]\r\nOri and the Blind Forest offers a beautiful interconnected world filled with hidden areas, secret abilities, and lore that rewards exploration. The game's map contains various regions that are visually distinct and offer unique challenges. Backtracking is encouraged as new abilities allow access to previously unreachable spots in previous areas. However, the game is more linear compared to other Metroidvania titles, with a clearer progression path that somewhat limits the experience of exploration.\r\n\r\n[h3]Gameplay: 4/5[/h3]\r\nThe gameplay in Ori and the Blind Forest is fluid and responsive, with a focus on precision platforming. While Ori doesn't jump high, he can move fast and jump far, and the game introduces a variety of abilities that make traversal increasingly dynamic and engaging. The platforming challenges are well-designed, requiring both timing and skill. While combat is present, it takes a backseat to exploration and platforming. The Definitive Edition also introduces new abilities and areas, further enhancing the gameplay experience.\r\n\r\n[h3]Progression: 4/5[/h3]\r\nProgression in Ori and the Blind Forest is satisfying, with a well-paced introduction of new abilities that enhance both combat and exploration. As you progress, you’ll find life and energy cells that increase your health and energy reserves, as well as ability points for use in the skill tree. The Definitive Edition also adds new areas that provide additional upgrades and abilities, enriching the overall progression. Unfortunately the game tells you where to go, so the progression can be quite linear unless you deliberately go back to previous areas.\r\n\r\n[h3]Narrative: 4.5/5[/h3]\r\nOri and the Blind Forest delivers an emotionally charged story rather than using environmental storytelling. The story is simple yet powerful, centered around themes of love, loss, and sacrifice. The game’s narrative is driven by its beautifully animated cutscenes, but it still has some dialogue. The connection between the player and the characters is strong, and the story unfolds in a way that is both heartfelt and impactful. The Definitive Edition also adds new narrative elements that further deepen the story and world.\r\n\r\n[h3]Visuals: 5/5[/h3]\r\nVisually, Ori and the Blind Forest is stunning, with beautiful artwork that brings the world to life in a breathtaking way. The game’s vibrant color palette and detailed environments create a magical atmosphere that is both immersive and captivating. Each area of the game is distinct, with its own unique aesthetic that enhances the overall experience. The animation is fluid, and the attention to detail in the character designs and backgrounds is exceptional. The Definitive Edition maintains this high standard, making Ori one of the most visually impressive platformers ever made.\r\n\r\n[h3]Music: 4.5/5[/h3]\r\nThe soundtrack of Ori and the Blind Forest is spectacular, with a score that perfectly complements the game’s emotional and atmospheric tone. Composed by Gareth Coker, the music enhances the emotional impact of the story and the grandeur of the world. The orchestral score is both powerful and evocative.\r\n\r\n[h3]Difficulty: 3.5/5[/h3]\r\nOri and the Blind Forest has some challenging gameplay, particularly in the platforming sections. The game requires precise timing and skill, which can be difficult, especially during the escape sequences. However, the game is punishing, with progress lost upon death and very little autosaving (requiring soul links which need energy to place).\r\n\r\n[h3]Replayability and Content: 3/5[/h3]\r\nCompletionists may find satisfaction in uncovering all the secrets and achieving 100% completion. However, once the game is fully explored and you've gotten all the achievements, there isn't much reason to play it more.",

Despite it's strong points, what ruins this game is the platforming. There are some long stretches of nearly impossible platforming because they are timed. It's too difficult as an entry-level into the genre. If you're on the fence about this game and don't like tough timed platforming, avoid this.",

This game makes you feel so many emotions and feels like a life's journey the whole way through.\n\nThe visuals, the mechanics, the soundtrack; everything combines into this beautiful composition that I will never forget.\n\nI can't describe it better than you just \"feel\" this game, not just play it.",

This game also needs a fair bit of patience, with the opening being a bit slow but picking up around the time youre chasing Gumo. i would still wholeheartily reccomend this to fans of metroidvanias",

To less the experienced in platformers or young players it might pose as intimidating in challenge-rating. But with time and a \"Not give up-attitude\" and you'll be fine. \r\nEverything about this game is an experience and it is something I recommend to everyone! \r\n\r\nTL;DR \r\nIn my opinon, this is a masterpiece. 10/10.",

Or a ticket for the movies, a bag of popcorn (small) and maybe a drink of 50cl and have a good time (hopefully) for 2h-2h30.\n\nThis game offers you an interactive experience in the form of a magical trip for 10-15 hours. \n\n\n\n",

        "review": "This game is aggressively mediocre.  A solid 5/10.\r\nThe graphics are really pretty, and the music is good for sleeping to.\r\nThe controls feels sloppy and the combat may as well be non-existent.\r\nThere are a lot of surprise kaizo style traps that will pull you out of the immersion of the story.  And it's never really clear what is part of the playing field and what is part of the super graphical background.  There were quite a few times I was just running along and would die and be like 'Wait, what hit me.  Ooh that's not background.'\r\nThe bright colorful scenery and background make it incredibly hard to tell what are the attacks you should be dodging.  Likewise, the foreground scenery often gets in the way of seeing what you're doing.\r\nThe game is very inconsistent about hazards.  For instance, first purple water is damaging, then blue water is deadly, then blue water is fine, then green water is deadly, then one time during an escape sequence you have to jump into green water immediately to avoid death, and it's safe.\r\nOri controls like they're constantly drunk. Attacks are inconsistent in both trajectories and damage.\r\nEvery hidden 'secret' in the game is just something hidden behind foreground scenery or something that requires you to find a hidden switch to stomp or torch to light.\r\nEvery 'dungeon' ends with a metroid style 'escape' that you can't save during.\r\nSaves are on you, you have to spend energy to save, but you can do it anywhere, but it's like save states.  Early game I almost never did it because I would forget.  But after having to collect the same collectables or watch the same cutscenes multiple times, I got to the point of just saving every time I walked into the next room.\r\nThe harder aspects of the game, it expects you to just know or figure out, which is fine.  But the easier aspects of the game, it will not stop giving you tooltips for.  I was in the last dungeon getting 'Hold RT to grab and move rocks' hint pop-ups.\r\nThe sound balancing is awful.  Like trying to watch a cinema release movie on a home TV.  You turn it up enough to hear basic sound effects and then a bird will screech and deafen you for the next half hour.\r\nBut the worst of all of it is the story.  The story is absolutely terrible.\r\nIt seems to be all about the extents parents will go for their children, but not one decision made by any of the 'parents' in the game is remotely close to a good one.  I'll avoid spoilers here, but it's a constant cycle of guilt-tripping, narcissistic behaviors, lack-of-forethought, and just the most terrible decision making I have ever seen in a game's story.  They even managed to include a bit of racism too.\r\n\r\nDespite all of these things, the game was pretty, and it was alright to play.  I did 100% it, mostly to make sure I didn't miss any potential terrible bits of story to make fun of.\r\nI didn't hate playing it, but I would say the difficulty curve was probably higher than most people who tend to enjoy indie arthouse style games would like.\r\nBut for being a 'puzzle' platformer, there never was a puzzle that I solved and felt good about.  It was always just a matter of me scouring the area until I found the switch or lantern or lever I had missed and then rolling my eyes.\r\nThere were a few good ideas in the game.  Like I really love the bash ability and being able to jump off of projectiles and monsters and stuff.\r\nBut overall, it just felt like someone made a game out of what should have been a movie.",

Because it never feels like you're missing something, the movement, combat and progression all feel incredibly fluid and organic.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I adore this game and can only praise and warmly recommend it to anyone who doesn't call platformers their arch-nemesis.",

        "review": "I wish I could recommend this game because I liked it. it has beautiful graphics and a good soundtrack, and the somewhat shallow story is enjoyable, but that's where my praises end. The gameplay and mechanics in this game suck and are very poorly explained. the majority of the game is platforming but the mechanics for the movement are imprecise at best and straight-up shit at worst or half the time you just don't know what to do because the game didn't tell you. the main way to move vertically is to dash off of certain objects, the problem is a good majority of the objects you need to dash off are enemy attacks. There is a dungeon right near the end of the game where the only way to move up is to dash off enemy attacks but the problem is half of the time they wouldn't attack so you're stuck just floating down into fire or spikes praying to get what you need. The save system is also abhorrent the only time you get an auto-save is either in dungeons or after a \"boss\", the only way to make a manual save is to use your \"mana\" but you also need your mana to do your stronger attacks so you often don't have much left. But even when you do have your mana it just doesn't let you save half the time because you're either too close to an enemy or in some sort of \"chase sequence\". I put the chase sequence in quotations because it's less of a chase and more of a sprint in the dark, right at the start of a chase you get an auto-save and then you must make precise jumps using the imprecise mechanics or you half to restart. Most of my time in the final chase was spent either waiting for the camera to catch up with me or dying because I was just slightly too slow and missed a cycle, thus being forced back to the start. now I know I have like 18 hours in this game but most of that was spent paused just contemplating my life choices after dying in the same BS 40 times. this could be a good game but it is held back drastically by garbage mechanics. Despite all this I still intend on playing the sequel, I hope it is better.",

The lighting, detail, framing, animation, and art style are all incredible.  \n\nThe game features a beautiful and dynamic fully orchestral soundtrack that is a perfect fit for the art and gameplay and is even an essential part of the game's style of storytelling.  \n\nAs advertised, although simple, the story is an emotional experience about love. I especially appreciate how much of it is told visually and musically, allowing many of the scenes to speak for themselves without dialogue.  \n\nThis game's movement (and thus the platforming) is one of my favorites in any game.  The action (after gaining a few abilities) is extremely fluid and engaging, with skill and an understanding of the mechanics rewarding the player with grace and speed in a very satisfying way.  Even simple traversal of the world is fun.  The \"Bash\" ability specifically is a real standout and one of the greatest abilities and mechanics in any game I've played, offering movement, positioning, offensive, defensive, and puzzle-solving capabilities all in one sleek package that pairs excellently with the other abilities.  \n\nMy only complaint (and it's minor) is that completing \"One Life\" mode shouldn't be an official achievement or the mode should have instead been a \"One HP\" mode.  It's a bit too punishing with how many insta-kills there are and encourages a slower, more conservative play-style that conflicts with the identity and flow of the game.  Practice each section several times on another save file if you intend to complete it.",

It has an incredibly strong and inspired art direction, and I loved every second of it. The soundtrack is also an absolute joy to the hears.\n\nThe gameplay loop of exploring the environment is really fun, and Ori feels light as a feather going around. Platforming feels smooth as butter, and it never took me long to get from one place to another. Combat is probably the game's weak link though, as it largely boils down to letting your companion do the fighting for you. Also, the game's checkpoint system is an interesting idea, but honestly it's a bit bogus, and resulted in some frustration. At least the dedicated save spots work as they should.\n\nDefinitive Edition is right! This version fixes a few of the most glaring progression issues that the original had, so I highly recommend that if you're gonna play Ori and the Blind Forest, play this one. You will not regret it.",

I played this after Hollow Knight, so I had some expectations going into the game, and they were all blown away. While the movements didn't feel as crisp as Hollow Knight, it didn't need to be. It would not have fit into this game world. The story though, ugh my heart. And don't get me started on the visuals of this game, as you could probably already tell from the trailer. It's. Incredible. Beautiful. Beautiful is the bare minimum term to describe this game. I've never played a game as unique as this, and I still haven't found one yet if I don't count its sequel.",

Ori and the blind forest is HARD.\nCombat is not that hard, just boring and cheesy, but the platforming requires very precise inputs in order to pass.\n\nAt start, when you're helpless and frail, everything can kill you by sneezing in your general direction.\nThorny bushes? (lots and lots of) death.\nSpiders? Death\nSlimes? death\n\nWhat helps lighten the burden is [b]the ability so save pretty much everywhere you like[/b], given you have energy to spend. This allows some heavy trial-and-error mindset to kick in until you pass.\n\nSome sections - three - requires you execute to near-perfection the forced-scrolling scene in order to survive and, believe me, the game is quite ruthless.\n\n[h3] An overall beautiful scenery [/h3]\nThe world of Nibel is very colorful and makes you think its thriving with life -  ruthless life. Pretty much every location is great looking and cruel at the same time. Swimming in the few aquatic sections is a dream.",

It effectively combines the Metroidvania style of gameplay with a solid narration and incredible art style, creating a true gaming gem.\n[h2] What I liked [/h2] \nThe visuals are just stunning, with great usage of colors and 2D animation.\nThe music is very fitting and helps build the emotional charge of the game.\nThe story is simple, yet extremely effective: it will make you cry and smile within a few hours of play.\nThe gameplay is fun and well crafted, with the highest difficulty being a nice challenge for experienced players.\n[h2] The only thing I didn't like [/h2]\nIn short, the escape sequences. While they are very cinematic and engaging, the magic stops as soon as you die a couple of times, and realize there will be no checkpoints until you complete them, leaving you in a trial and error situation. Definitely not a deal breaker but still, they don't live up to the quality of this great work of art.\n\nThis game can be definitely used as an example to prove that video games are, indeed, art.\n\n[b] Recommended for players of all ages and tastes.

This game is simply the most beautiful game I have ever played. The areas are so beautiful and full of life, every inch of the game feels like a beautiful painting, where every color and element complement eachother to form one of the most amazing experiences ever. Not to mention the gameplay, which is EXTREMELY fun, specially after you unlock the bash mechanic. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time. It's a work of art.",

I am not a platform gamer, but this was a polished beautiful and emotional game. The progression was steady, controls intuitive, and the story was crazy deep for a platform game. Absolute delight to play. Playing the sequel next. More Like THIS!",

        "review": "I feel like I’m going insane seeing how well reviewed and acclaimed this game is. It manages to be short, tedious, oversaturated, and shallow all at once. Finished the story waiting to get to the good part just to see the credits roll after the least interesting final sequence of all time.\n\nThe combat mechanics are horrifying. I know it’s not the focus, but if that’s the case make it quick. The damage you deal with the stupid auto aim button mash attack is near useless, the oone that uses the same resource as SAVING THE GAME is slow and clunky, and the only thing that actually does any damage, bash, requires you to wait for a projectile and throw yourself in the opposite direction two or three times. It’s fine to make the game about platforming, but if that’s the case then stop putting random useless barriers in front of the platforming. The most insulting bit was reusing the same boring, time consuming “pop up out of the ground” boss thing on several occasions. Just play the unskippable cutscene and get it over with.\n\nAnd despite the fact that puzzles and platforming are the only mechanics that the developers gave more than a minute of thought to, they’re barely better than the combat! The only times I actually thought about an interesting way to solve a puzzle were when I missed the “instantly solves this puzzle” button in the next room, or needed an ability I didn’t have yet. The depth goes no further than “here is a new mechanic. Use that mechanic in the most obvious possible way, also there’s like seven random spots to use this specific ability scattered around the map.” \n\nPlatforming and moving around were just okay. Early game is frustrating because you have no ways to move around, and by the time that you have them the imprecision of the controls and floor layouts are very apparent by the way that they instant kill you over and over. Several memorable times where I needed to stand on a wobbling platform, or walked too close to a corner where the floor turns to spikes, or needed to wait for an enemy to decide to shoot at me while I floated towards the lava with no meaningful way to interact with it. Any time I forgot to save immediately after making marginal progress on a puzzle or after watching a cutscene/getting a game pause for a mandatory explanation was time wasted on the next random thing that killed me.\n\nThe game’s issues are at their most glaring during the escape sequences. Because they decided to put no checkpoints in them, and speed up the environmental hazard if you get too fast, none of the individual portions can be all that challenging or interesting. But, inevitably, there will be something in the back half that you fuck up a few times or aren’t sure what the game is asking you to do and you get to restart the entire thing. The last fire section, the most “cinematic” and climax of the game, kept having the camera lag behind to look at the owl while I did the early sections half off-screen, then killed me when I clipped a corner of the geometry somewhere. I get that you’re proud of how pretty the game is, but let me play it please.\n\nThe game’s art and music are also… just okay? It certainly feels high budget, but the character designs, especially Gumo and the gorilla thing, are off putting and not very well animated. The world is so focused on having texture and bright lights and beauty that it’s often hard to tell apart the background and the foreground - and a major reason the combat feels terrible is you can’t see a damn thing with all the particle effects on the dinky autoaim attack. My absolute biggest gripe is how often the game uses that same title screen music chord progression - seriously every emotional beat uses the same music, it loses all its impact immediately and is SUCH a strange decision for a game with as high of a budget as this seems to have had. Write a second song.\n\nThe only other thing the game has that it’s praised for is the story, which was basically nonexistent. The two gods in the story just sort of accidentally kill each other’s kids, get mad, and then stop just short of doing it again because the owl learned to be kind after accidentally almost killing its own kid and you. I’m being reductive, but it’s really not any deeper than “kindness wins”.\n\nMaybe graciously, the game is also amazingly short. My save file, with about an hour or so of idle time, came to only 6 and a half hours to beat the main game. Obviously, I didn’t do everything, but anyone decent to mediocre at platforming and not hellbent on 100%ing isn’t likely to get more than 4 or 5 hours out of this. Even on sale, that’s a tough buy compared to the countless games that do every element of this game better and with more interesting, varied, lengthy content to go with it. What a waste of time.",

The sequel has been on my backlog for years and I want to play it so so bad. But it has to be saved for a special occassion and a chunk of a couple weeks when it can take up the big TV :O",

Played the game on Hard but I think all it did was make the enemies more annoying.  If I play it again it'll be on Normal.  No boss fights.  The difficulty is in the platforming...and the difficult part of the platforming is how floaty the controls are.\r\n\r\nStill, I enjoyed the game.  Looked good.  Music was good.  No crashes.",

Just the gameplay feels awful and has some severe structural flaws and feels very disconnected from the tone of the plot.",

This might not be a problem since the combat is not the main point but it is a nice addition for the game.\n[spoiler]The second game, Ori and The Will of the wisps has an amazing combat system [/spoiler]\n\nOverall experience, 9/10, and this because of technical issues, even if being Definitive Edition, still has some stuttering on some machines, but if you do encounter, play for like 15 mins and enable VSync, as higher refresh rate might impact your experience.",

The combat is pretty stale, you pretty much just spam one button for the entire game and dodge attacks. The platforming does get fun towards the end but it's mainly hard because you can barely jump. Also, beware the final sequence; it is the most infuriating part of the game as it suddenly goes from fairly relaxed puzzle-solving platforming to make one mistake or slow down and you die. It was not fun\r\n\r\nTL;DR: It's a solid platformer, it takes a while to get going but the story and the puzzles are pretty good.",

The visuals look like they belong in a museum, and the soundtrack sounds like it should be performed by an orchestra. For the audiovisual side of the game, Ori does everything right. The platforming is very good too, with the controls being fluid and responsive. Only gripe is that there is a learning curve with each skill, expecting you to master it quickly. This is one of the most beautiful games I've played, and after finishing everything, including one-life, I have to say, you need to play it too. Or at least watch a playthrough.",

Unintuitive or even counterintuitive in some cases (in one case you are expected to use a power to break something which should not otherwise break from using that power...).\n-There is an extremely steep learning curve early on. Several times you will learn a new skill and then be immediately forced to become an expert at it.\n-Some of the time sequenced events are absolutely terrible. And the game will autosave over your save file at the start of the sequence, so you can't just come back to it, reloading you with a half a second to register that you just died before you have to start moving again. And they are pretty unforgiving to mistakes.\n-\"Easy\" mode is a lie lol. I'm not sure what the other difficulties change but if you are not great at videogames you might just want to watch a playthrough of this instead.\n",

However along with that I would also call it grand when it comes to a majority of the games set pieces. Despite Its welcoming appearance the game can be quite difficult at times, though I wouldn't call it bad as its save system makes it very forgiving. My personal favorite segments being the end of the temples. Its tricky fast pace platforming with epic music to keep pushing you forward. Though it might take a number of times, the satisfaction of the perfect run is worth it as it is very similar to the bonus levels of Donkey Kong Country Returns and Rayman Origins. This is a perfect start for anyone curious about the Metroidvania genre as Its short and sweet with no boring segments in between that I highly can't recommend enough.",

        "review": "Honestly, my thoughts after completing the game were: I'm so glad that it's over. The art and the music are amazing, but everything else was incredible frustrating. The fighting mechanics are pretty boring and most of the platforming parts were really annoying.  Most of the areas look really similar and sometimes it was difficult to see what was part of the scenery and what was a trap. Sometimes it was also difficult to see Ori, either because of lights or just because they're tiny. I didn't care much for the story because it felt sort of shallow but the ending scenes were nice.\nTher were some good parts that really made me want to like this game, but they just couldn't make up for the rest. I'm a little disappointed because all the reviews were incredibly positive but I will probably never play this again.",

Fantastic visual style and animation, great sound and soundtrack (especially I like the idea, that if you fail during 'running from something' section, soundtrack doesn't restart, it continues until you succeed) and unexpectedly touching story. It is metroidvania, so it has all genre related attributes, like huge labyrinth-like map, that interesting to explore, lots of abilities (almost all gamepad buttons are in use), that make you stronger and allow you to explore more. Combat system is simple, gameplay is more platforming-oriented and the platforming itself is hard (by design - control is responsive) and flexible (thanks to big amount of abilities).\r\nGreat addition to collection of every metroidvania fan.",

The game constantly throws names of things, people, and places at you and expects you to care because they're not there anymore  or whatever. If you don't save right after a cutscene or dialogue, you have to watch it all over again for no good reason. Especially annoying because you get a limited number of saves through your mana bar. That same mana bar is used for some exploration abilities, actively discouraging you from exploring the game or trying interesting things without savescumming if it fails. You can also very easily get stuck in long sequences because the game decides not to offer you any mana crystals in that section. Combat is offensively bad, you get one button to spam (technically some mana-based abilities as well, but they suck balls) and then you just dodge enemy attack patterns. But the best strategy is to look for some sort of highground where enemies can't hit you and just spam your attack until they're dead. Then you save, and that's all the combat challenge gone from that section.\n\nJust play hollow knight or la mulana if you want an interesting metroidvania to play.",

        "review": "After playing this game again to remind myself of the story before playing the sequel, I quickly remembered why I hate it. Yes, the art and music are fantastic and the movement feels fluid and satisfying, but this game is filled to the brim with bullshit.\n\nInstant death traps come in all forms. Some spikes will instantly kill you even though they look identical to other spikes that only damage you. Some parts of the ceiling will drop a block on you before you can even register its movement, and are slightly shadowed so they're difficult to notice, especially since Ori himself draws so much attention with his bright color. Some walls have laser beams that fire periodically, while having a noticeable but very brief warning beforehand, and dodging them can sometimes be difficult due to some rather slippery controls.\n\nThere's also a few chase sections in which you must escape an approaching threat (that instantly kills you if touched) by using the skills you've obtained to navigate through a sort of obstacle course. These scenes almost always involve some level of trial and error, since additional obstacles will be thrown at you from offscreen leaving you with a fraction of a second to react. These sections are extremely difficult to complete without either foreknowledge or insanely fast reaction time. Combine this with platforming segments that give absolutely no room for even the slightest error, and you've got a recipe for frustration.\n\nOn top of all of this, death sends you back to your last save point. Designated save point shrines are scattered throughout the world, but they're sparse. The only way to save your progress outside of those is by expending a small amount of your energy resource to drop a \"Soul Link.\" Now, energy refills aren't too uncommon and you can quickly increase your maximum capacity, but still - what if you're out of energy, or just forget to save for a while? Suddenly you get obliterated by something you couldn't see coming and several minutes of progress has just been erased in the blink of an eye. Now you have to go and grab all those collectibles all over again. That's nice and fair!\n\nI could go over the metroidvania collection and exploration aspect, or the story presentation, or the sound design, or any other of the game's really good aspects, but for me they're almost entirely overshadowed by obnoxious hazards that require pixel-perfect execution to avoid and the near-constant annoyance of cheap deaths.",

Так и получается что они все это жижа обыкновенная, жижа фиолетовая, жижа огненная, жижа зеленая ах да еще птицы.\r\n\r\nРасположение врагов - очень скудно, бесяче.\r\n\r\nНекоторые ловушки стоят за фоном, где хрен их как либо заметишь. Убогий сюжет, который написала двухнедельная косая собака. Саундтрек - ужасный. Я пол игры прошел с выключеной музыкой. Движения камеры при \"боссфайтах\". Повторение одной и той же катсцены пока не соизволишь потратить ману на сейв. А если это анимация боссфайта, то вообще пипец. \r\nУжасно малое количество типов врагов/неписей. Кривая система подсчета урона. Я на шипах стоял и не получал урон. \r\n\r\nНизкополигональные Гумон и Нару. Пипец стремные\r\nСова разве что красивая, но ее ближе к концу игры хочется зажарить вместе с картошкой. Особенно если начал с высокого уровня сложности как я. Только в конце пришлось поменять сложность чтоб пройти это говно и удалить нахрен.",

It reinforces this by forcing several unskippable cutscenes that, if you happen to forget to save immediately afterward, are forced to watch all over again should you die soon after. There are quite a few of these instances.\n2. Many ledges/environmental hazards don't match their model so you'll fall off or take damage without actually touching them. There's also a questionable amount of instant death traps hidden all over.\n3. Aerial control is at times very sloppy and almost seems like there's an input delay for the sake of not breaking progression too much.\n4. Enemies are pretty much just a button-mashing game. There's no learning involved, just spam M1 (or in the later half, press M2 once or twice). Also, there's no boss encounters. Instead, you get \"escape the area\" timed events that have gotcha one-shots you can't reasonably know are there on the first run-through that immediately send you back to the start of the escape event. Basically, just stuff to waste your time and frustrate you.\n5. Extremely short game. I got this on sale, but damn would I be disappointed if I bought this for the full price.\n\nGame looks nice, though in some areas the bloom effects are so bright you can barely see what is happening around you. Play Hollow Knight instead, it's a better game in all regards.\n",

The art throughout the entire game is gorgeous.  The music is very good.  The atmosphere is very good, I love the game world.\n\nThe gameplay just doesn't hold up.  It's fun in a number of areas.  But far, far too many places in this game expect you to do things that are not just unintuitive, but anti-intuitive.  I've been confused in games before, gotten stuck, figured it out, enjoyed the whole experience for what it was, even when it was frustrating at times.  I know how that goes.  This is different.  The game artists should get to legally give the level/gameplay designers a wedgie for a full calendar year after what they did to their baby.\n\nIt's frankly strange to see just how botched and amateurish the level/gameplay design is when the whole thing is so gorgeous, well-presented, and otherwise polished.  With about a third of the game left to go, I'm going to finish it, but I expect it to be a slog that's mostly unfun with occasional patches of fun, which I'm going through in the hopes that the ending is even a tenth as beautiful as the beginning.",

Furthermore, i was also very excited to give a review. \n\n\n---WHAT I LIKED---\nI do love the visuals of the game, the story, the colours, the environments. I do find certain elements of the game very fun. The music is nice. The animation is really good.\n\n---WHAT I DID NOT LIKE---\nAlthough for me it lacked personality. There is not many interesting things going on in this game. Some of the platforming is made a bit wonky. There is at certain areas, maybe a bit too much effects in the background which makes the non linear character hard to see. Some elements in the environment such as the spike areas, are hard to notice due to the same issue.\nThere is no variety of music either. Despite that the music is really beautiful, for the price it is at, i expect more diversity in the soundtracks variations. This is more of a personal opinion on the music. \nThere was this area with flooding, the character has to escape to the very top of the tree. I did this first try, surprisingly. I guess it is because when i was playing this game, i only played it to get over with it, as I could not enjoy it any further.\nI also noticed while going through a lot of pain to do many things that was required for next step, there was no reward system integrated.\n I really was playing only because i did all this \"effort\", and when i DO get an upgrade, i am not able to adapt to the new ability as quickly due to the design of the game. \nAnother thing to add, i was not a fan of the narrative. It is not for me personally. I enjoy quiet narratives, i however did not find the voice over as interesting as i should of.\n\n\n---OVERALL---\nI wish i could have enjoyed this game as much as everyone else did. I tried really hard to get into it. I kept on playing it or even probably at this point was forcing myself to play it, until i realised it's really not my type of game. I do see a lot of space for improvement and a lot of flaws in the game play and environment. \n\nAt the end of the day, i also tried to enjoy the experience as much as i could.\n\n This however does not mean the game is not worthy of checking out :)). It was just not my cup of tea.",

Want to use something other than x that no normal person use? Forget it. etc.\n\nIf u really really want to play this game tho, be sure to choose the original version and not this definitive edition. While u still cant remap keys in the orignal, the keys are at least less retarded to use there, the usual E and shift and such. Definitive editon also dont drop cards but the original does. \nHowever the original also comes with frequent crashes, specailly if u tab out in exclusive mode or dare to minimize the windowed mode, a very hard combat and general play/movement feature on easy mode for most ppl, as well as random crashes on certain hotspots when triggering cutscenes.\nSo take ur pick lol its one unlayable game or the other: this one with a retarded control scheme and 2 xtra maps but no cards and u sell ur soul to the devil by going along with the mapping scheme, or the original where u can put it in windowed mode and let it run and play with itself while u leech the cards and cry over the game u really want to play but cant because it keeps crashing  and require expert movement and gaming skills u do not posses as a normal casual gamer who want it on easy mode which in fact = super hard mode. \n\n(The original can no longer be bought tho, u need to buy the definitive version to get that one, and oh the ppl who originally bought the default game way bk are no longer allowed to dl it even if they own it, but at least they got a 75% coupon to buy the definitive edition bk then, which apparently expired b4 most ppl were aware of it + it was during the better part of a sale event where u cant use coupons in the first place.\n\nConsider if u want to support this type of attitude from devs/publishers, even if the game does have spectacular visuals and story.\nI personally tried to get into this game, loved the begining, then the game started crashing every time i tabbed out and then I read that its apparently so difficult even on easy mode and continue to crash further ni, and im giving up on it at least while I have other games to play. I played it just enough to get all the cards which was sold or turned into gems.\nGJ ppl for making such a wonderful game but locking it behind one stupidity after another.\n\nPlay Ori of the Wild Forest instead, which is the second game. I had no issues with that game myself, it was great all the way through and u can remap keys in that game.\n\nIf ur desperate enough, or just a dumb pushover, u can edit a config file using a guide and hope it works. Which it appears to not do for most/a lot of ppl.\nIm not even gonna bother with it as this should be a default option in the game.\nWatching this game on stream I can also tell that its not as good as the ratings imply, they are highly overrated.\nThis game is frustrating and the purpose seem to be wasting ur time. The save mechanic is a further sign that they jsut want to waste ur time and take the fun out of it.\n\nOh and the CEO(s) of the Moon Studios GmbH has had a lot of complaints and reports from his employers, who describe him as toxic and treats them unreasonably and just downright bad.\n\nPls do NOT support this game or this company and find another game to play that isnt designed to treat u like the utmost waste of trash.\nBut ok u cant really expect much from microsoft can u..\nThe review ratings are NOT accurate, they are highly overrated and probably not what they seem. but thats just 'guesswork' ofc..\n\n-Arch Linux Manjaro KDE Plasma 6",

        "review": "I would describe this as a Metroidvania-lite. If you just do the things the game tells you to do, it's quite linear. But you do have the option to wander around, fill out the map, etc. So if you can turn off completionism brain, you can just play through with very little back and forth.\r\nThe movement ends up being quite satisfying once you get Bash. Though I would say there's a bit of slop in precision movements. I'm by no means 'good' at precision platforming. But there were times where it didn't feel like it was me being bad, so take that for what it is.\r\nI appreciate the pretty world; the visuals and soundscape make for a lovely place to lose yourself in.\r\nSave syncs across Steam Deck and PC, so that was awesome, played about half and half.",

I got this for my wife to have some fun times after we completed limbo and inside, the music and art looked awesome. \r\nThere are no control sensitivity option, so the bash aim on controller is very very finicky. There are no autosave or checkpoints, you can't pan around the map and the mini map isn't very useful. Absolute waste of money if you ask me. \r\n\r\nIf you wan't to buy a game so you can grind in it, then maybe you will like it. For us it felt like a chore that was harder than our day jobs.",

        "review": "\"Ori and the Blind Forest,\" developed by Moon Studios, is a visually stunning action-platformer that combines challenging gameplay with an emotionally powerful story. You play as Ori, a guardian spirit, navigating a beautifully crafted forest to save it from decay.\n\nThe game features tight, responsive controls and a variety of abilities that make exploration and combat deeply satisfying. Its hand-painted artwork, meticulously animated character performances, and fully orchestrated soundtrack create an immersive and emotional experience.\n\nPros:\n\n-Gorgeous hand-painted visuals and animation.\n-Tight, responsive controls and fluid gameplay.\n-Emotional and compelling narrative.\n-Beautifully orchestrated soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n\n-High difficulty may frustrate some players.\n-Relatively short game.\n\nOverall, \"Ori and the Blind Forest\" is a breathtaking and emotionally resonant platformer that’s a must-play for fans of the genre. 9/10",

Essentially, unless you enjoy dying dozens of times on \"easy\" mode to figure out how to navigate some of the puzzles, this is not the game for you. I couldn't spare the patience to finish this game when there are so many others on Steam that don't make me want to throw my controller across the room.",

Really pretty so I suggest just watching a playthrough as it'll most likely be better than playing through it yourself.\n\nCons:\n\n* The game is like a baby's first metroidvania.  \n* There are a few time based puzzles (which suck).  Wait for this projectile to be at this spot to use this ability. Then move to the next spot so you can wait for the projectile to be at the next right stop.  If you miss then start all over with the waiting.\n* It feels like there's a lag to the movement.  There other weird thing that happens in the movement is that the main character \"trips\" while running.  You'll be going at full speed then just slow down or do a slight hop or stop for no reason.  \n* The story starts off strong and emotional but then the game mostly gives up on the story.  There's little to no connection of gameplay or even the rest of the game to the emotional beginning.  \n\nPlay a better metroidvania and just skip this one imo.",

The artwork will blow you away every chance it gets, and so will the extraordinary soundtrack. The story may be a bit cheezy, yes, but I guarantee you that even the first few minutes will hit you right in the soul (unless you don't have one, of course). Also, Ori is the cutest little critter to ever walk the earth. Anything that hurts him, hurts me even more. And of course, ANYTHING will hurt him. Little man will explode if he twists his ankle.\r\n\r\nThat being said, beating the game on One Life mode was one of the most satisfying video game challenges I've completed, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. It's also not quite as hard as some people make it out to be, as the real challenge doesn't come from how hard it is not to make a mistake, but how much the game punishes you for making that mistake. I on my first play-through of the game, I died hundreds of times, my next play-though of the game was on hard mode, and even on hard mode I died significantly less. Because this is a game you can learn, and you will be able to very clearly see the progress of that learning as you play, because it doesn't matter how much the game punishes you for making a mistake if you don't make it in the first place. The more you learn the game, the less mistakes you'll make, and it will feel SO good. All the game wants from you is perfection, and with enough patience and practice, you WILL be able to do it, and it will feel amazing.\r\n\r\nArtistically, this game is a masterpiece, and there are moments so gorgeous and so creative that it will take your breath away. As someone who loves artsy games, there are times I love it so much that it hurts. I wholeheartedly recommend joining Ori on his heroic journey to restore this forest, and I wish you all the luck possible in not dying immediately.  :)\r\n\r\n",

Each section is so beautifully crafted that you can't help stare in awe as you jump and explore every nook and cranny to get the 100% completion, because this game truly deserves it, as you are accompanied by the most beautiful soundtrack I have ever had the pleasure to experience.\n\nThe actual gameplay starts a bit slow as you are thrown into a dangerous environment where Ori has to learn and experience how to brave through the true dangers of a corrupt forest that has lost its lush life a long time ago. As the story progresses, you will get abilities that allow you enough time to really get to know them individually, and by the time you get to the last chapters of the game, you will be zooming and juggling around the map like an expert in an incredibly satisfying motion. \n\nOverall, I consider Ori and the Blind Forest an incredibly beautiful and fun game to play that will leave most players wishing that they could experience it all for the first time again.",

It definitely has a tighter progression, which while not necessarily a bad thing, makes it feel a bit more leashed in comparison to games like Hollow Knight. It holds your hand a bit to much for my taste. I also think this game really needed some real bosses. The \"bosses\" we go get are just stealth or platforming challenges. Ori's moveset is so complex and acrobatic and poses very unique opportunities for combat that never really get fully realized due to the lack of complex bosses to match. Not to mention that the bosses of these kinds of games are what really hang in your memory. Overall I find Ori was fun, albeit a bit forgettable. So much so that I never felt the desire to play the DLC or return for its sequel. That said, you won't go wrong with this game. The music is great, the art is beautiful, and the gameplay is solid. Just buy it on sale. It isn't quite worth full price.",

        "review": "\"Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition\" falls short of its promise to deliver a captivating and enchanting gaming experience, ultimately failing to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor.\r\n\r\nOne of the most glaring issues with the game is its difficulty curve. While a certain level of challenge can be expected in a platformer, \"Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition\" takes it to an extreme, with frustratingly precise platforming sections and punishing combat encounters that feel more like exercises in frustration than tests of skill. The game's unforgiving checkpoints only serve to exacerbate the problem, forcing players to repeatedly replay difficult sections until they get them just right.\r\n\r\nThe story, which should be a highlight of any narrative-driven game, is similarly underwhelming. While the game attempts to tug at players' heartstrings with its tale of friendship and sacrifice, it ultimately falls flat due to its predictable plot twists and lack of emotional depth. Characters are one-dimensional and forgettable, with little in the way of development or nuance to make them truly compelling.\r\n\r\nGraphically, the game is a mixed bag. While the hand-drawn art style is undeniably beautiful and atmospheric, the visuals can be overly busy and cluttered at times, making it difficult to discern important details during intense platforming sequences. Performance issues are also common, with frequent frame rate drops and stuttering that detract from the overall experience.\r\n\r\nEven the \"Definitive Edition\" enhancements, which promise improved visuals and additional content, fail to impress. While the new areas and abilities are a welcome addition, they do little to address the game's core issues and ultimately feel tacked on and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the end, \"Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition\" is a disappointing follow-up to the original game that fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor. Its punishing difficulty, lackluster story, and technical issues make it a hard game to recommend to anyone other than the most dedicated platforming enthusiasts.",

The mechanics are just entertaining to use.\r\nThe puzzles require a good eye and some creativity.\r\nThe game has absolutely stunning visuals. Every frame is wallpaper material.\r\n\r\nBut my favourite part of this game is Ori's animations.\r\nOri is so lively in every animation. For which there is many, many animations. \r\nI love watching this little sprite terrorise the local ecosystem with a funky blue orb.",

        "review": "So I bought the game in 2022, finished it and felt pretty good about it. The artstyle was good, gameplay was alright, phenomenal music. Out of curiosity, I decided to reinstall the game today, and start a new playthrough. 4 hours later on the same day, my emotional ass was staring at the end credits feeling like a new person. While the combat may seem lackluster, as you upgrade your skill tree and imporve your arsenal, it does get quite fun to see just how powerful the game lets you become. The movement is incredibly satisfying, with the most fluid parkour animations I have ever seen in a game, as well as the controls feeling genuinely amazing to use. The soundtrack is nothing short of a fucking masterpiece, with a phenomenal story accompanied by said soundtrack. It's a metroidvania, so it (of course) has a metroidvania-style gameplay loop with exploration and backtracking, and permanent ability unlocks. I don't know why the game was so unmemorable to me on my first run two years ago, but I could not recommend this enough, everybody deserves to experience this game at least once.\n\nOh, and buy the sequel too, it's even better!",

        "review": "[h1]Frustrating Console Platform Jumper with a Meaningless Story[/h1]\n\nI sometimes enjoy a good console-like side scrolling action platformer. Unfortunately this is not one of those times. I got Ori on sale and even then it's not worth the price. The story is vague and rather pointless, as it leans HEAVILY on mood and forced emotion rather than any real meaning. Completely void of any sort of noteworthy storytelling. And to add insult to injury, the areas you travel are a rehash of the old wind/fire/water elemental theme, except with trees and some sort of ancient spirit whatever. Really Moon Studios? Weak.\n\nAnd as is the trend of these modern platformers, they love to punish you for not knowing thing in advance. Literally (yes, literally) they'll crush you for no reason other than to satisfy the need for a character power. Honestly it feels like they added powers and the mechanics they achieve first, then built the worlds around this to gate your progression. If I'm forced to travel in a specific path through your maze, at least give me some direction. The worst mechanic of this is tying save points to an expendable resource. And if you make a poor choice in where you save before a particularly annoying gauntlet of pointless hurdles, you're doomed to either try over and over again to get through it or rage quit.\n\nThe only challenge is from timing jumps perfectly, often with the addition of a timer aspect such as projectiles thrown at you, boulders rolling down towards you, doorways closing, etc. Pointless obstacles and platform jumping with no meaning for them existing otherr than to keep progressing is rather dull.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, as the graphics are fun, the music is amazing, and animations are buttery smooth. So this had a ton of potential at its core, but was put into the hands of amateur storytellers and level designers. My top complaint on the gameplay mechanics itself is that positioning my character while jumping is a bit too twitchy. Otherwise everything is good at the game's core. In short, the level design and story is Ori's downfall.",

Like most metroidvanias the power-ups give you access to more areas, but the bash skill is especially good (imagine using enemies to blast yourself through the air). There were also incredible moments where I expected a boss battle only to get frantic run from destructing environments. I enjoyed the story, how little there was and how it managed to be touching with so little. Great game with good platforming, exploration, with beautiful scenery... and as a far as metroidvanias this one has a broader than appeal than most.",

The last platformer games I truly enjoyed was during the gameboy era.  Ori was definitely worth it. Hats off to the studio who made this beautiful game and I'm going to play the second one.  10/10 !",

I'm looking at you escape sequences! I played with a mouse and keyboard, but I've heard it's a lot easier with a controller for anyone who get's frustrated and has one available.\n\nOtherwise the visuals are beautiful if a bit to much at times, and I can't tell what's going on because of all the lights. \nI praise the story for being told through scenes and actions, but I don't much care for it since it's a bit of a cliche.\nSoundtrack is fitting, level design is well .. designed and thought-out.  \nThe gameplay/abilities are alright, a weird clunkiness to the controls (e.g. The wall climb and super jump) with mouse and keyboard but that's what I get I suppose for playing it on one.",

ESPECIALLY with the various escape sequences, those were quite a jump in difficulty, and maybe too much of a jump. while i personally didn't mind them being really difficult, as i enjoy some good challenges, and i think they were overall fair on top of being fun, but i could definitely see that being a bit of an issue for more casual players, if not a straight-up turnoff for them.\r\n\r\nbut yeah, all that to say that i personally love this game and i am very much looking forward to getting to the sequel.\r\n\r\neventually. \r\n\r\nwhen i'm not lazy lol\r\n\r\n(also how tf do people beat this game without dying lmao, like there's no way i could do something like that i'm gonna be fr xD)",

Great story telling that mostly shows you stuff instead of just telling you, I absolutely love that, and even my cold dead heart felt some of the moments in the story.\r\n\r\nThe combat I didn't like that much and those escape sequences were extremely hard and annoying to the point it became frustrating. Some parts of it is like the devs almost want you to see the future or something, I literally failed some of the escapes like 50 times before I finally got through. No savepoints, one little mistake takes you back to the beggining of it. I like challenges in games but some of that was way too much.",

The game is beautiful, albeit I had to lock it to 40FPS, and the soundtrack is nice. \nBeware the opening is pretty emotional, but then the fun starts. \nJust when you think you have mastered all the movement a new one gets added. Personally I enjoyed how the difficulty level steadily increased and it kept me coming back for me to see what’s next. \n\nI’ll definitely be playing the next iteration after I finish the story in this one.",

Gradual drip-feed of abilities lets you re-visit sections over and over again, gradually increasing what you can do in each. \r\nMost of the game is quite relaxed with relaxing walking evolving into relaxing acrobatics as you zoom about.\r\nPuzzles aren't too difficult, but some will have you scratching your head for a bit.\r\nMain section have an enforced platforming section you have to pass to complete - initially I thought I'd hate these, but have a nicely judged \"one-more-time\" mechanic and you'll get a little bit further on each try.",

It's telling that the much better sequel got rid of it in favor of a more traditional autosave. Same goes for the combat. Worth playing for the vibes though, and to lead into the sequel.",

You don't really need to go back in past area besides to collect bonus (life/essence/talent point) and combat is rather inexistant.\nI didn't really like the story but overall I have to say that's a good game. Some part are really challenging, musics are beautiful. Art design you'll like or not but it's unique in its kind\n\nFrankly, I got it for 5€ in sales and it's given for a great game even if it's pretty short. Took me a bit less thant 12 hours and I didn't collect everything.\n\nDefinitely you should give it a go if you haven't try it already and if you're willing to do a bit of die & retry",

This game gets you used to the game mechanics of the world and while the wall climbing can be difficult once you've played it for a little while you do get used to it.\r\n\r\nThe world of The Blind Forest is interactive so looking around and seeing how you can use the environment is going to be a big help. The most challenging part of both games are the chase sequences which, I'm not going to lie, are not my favourite. However if you can get them down in this one they shouldn't be too bad in WotW. The sequel also has bosses so, again, I do think it is better to get the basics down in this one first.\r\n\r\nLastly, and should have been first really, is the story, music and graphics of this world. It really is beautiful. Playing backwards I was still able to appreciate Ori's beginnings before the events of WotW and I don't think it matters which way you play the two games, the story is beautiful either way and I quite liked learning how the characters in WotW came together after already getting to know them.\r\n\r\nThis could be a little challenging or frustrating for younger children, but then the same could be said for some adult players also.",

Oh my God... Bash.\r\n + Almost every upgrade you find can be used as a movement tool, so you are able to string together some really nutty actions.\r\n + Your base movement speed is higher then it typically would be in a game like this. Pair that with the enhanced movement and you can zip around like a fly on crack.\r\n + Has some really creative platforming sections.\r\n + While there were no dedicated boss fights, they made up by having these super cool \"escape sequences\" that hold the fastest and most difficult platforming in the game.\r\n - Although you can do some super impressive movements with your abilities, your base jump is pretty wimpy.\r\n - Some walls are pretty slippery and can be annoying to vault up and off of.\r\n - \"Energy\" economy was weird. Started out the game having to scrounge for resources, but ended it not even having to care. That could very well have been intentional, but I was not a big fan of the first few moments due to that.\r\n - There are switches that you have to slam into and many of them you need to do so multiple times which only slowed it down.\r\n - A few secrets feel archaic and uncalled for.\r\n - Combat was largely enjoyable as a whole.\r\n\r\nPresentation: 19/20\r\n + I mean, just look at it.\r\n + Not only is it a beautiful game to look at, it is a highly stylized game at that so the beauty is \r\n + Intractables are very clear, allowing them to be easily used on instinct.\r\n + The music was simply great. I was already listening to it on its own before I even beat the game.\r\n + Sound effects were good, though there was notion that I need so stop an listen to.\r\n + A very clean and effective UI.\r\n - While Interactables are easy to spot, hazards are less prominent and can sneak up on you.\r\n - I suspect that Kuro, the main antagonist, was animated differently from the rest of the cast, leading her to stick out like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\n\r\nStory: 14/20\r\n + Very cute and adorable. Makes me happy.\r\n + Had one of the best opening sequences I have seen in a while.\r\n + There are a very few voiced roles, though they are done well in what I believe to be a fictional language.\r\n - The ending felt kind of abrupt.\r\n\r\nTotal: 86/100\r\nStatement: This was one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a while. Very much so looking forward to playing Will of the Wisps.",

Often I missed the fun part in the game. 1/5\n\nMechanics: Very unpractical and annoying. The checkpoint system is broken and enemies are often ridicolusly overpowered. The movement feels clumsy and wobbly. I often felt I couldnt control Ori like I should been able to, so I ended up with a frustrated feeling. 1/5\n\nStory: Cute, but didnt felt original. 4/5\n\nOverall, if you like a challenge, and you love detailed art, this game is for you. But if you looking for a fun time and a smooth experience, dont buy it.",

The game to me looked like a strewn-together hours of anxiety-inducing acrobatic exercises and running away from bosses or things like lava or water, with screen shaking all the time and sounds/music trying to ratchet up the tension.\r\n\r\nWhile there are certainly players who enjoy this kind of play style, if you don't want to get an early Alzheimer's diagnosis or some mental disease, I would not purchase or devote much time to this game.",

It was a good decision.\r\n\r\nOri and the Blind Forest.. is not a game. It is a work of art. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack so touching it made me cry even from a main menu track, the story is beautiful (though sad at times), and the gameplay is not that bad for me as a newbie to platformers, though new players will find the first tough situation (you will know it when you get there) a serious challenge.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah. I did it, I finished the game, which is something I did not expect. Now onto the sequel.",

        "review": "This isn't a good game, which is a shame. Based on the reviews I thought that this was some amazing metroidvenia/platformer with some amazing story and aesthetics.\r\nWhile we can safely say the art style, graphics and music are ethereal on the surface, they have a huge problem. Everything is dialed up to eleven without consideration to its necessity.\r\n\r\nEverything is vividly colored, nicely textured there are nice effects of explosions and foreground/background elements. It just looks amazing, but it is horrible to play. Half the time some element of the scene obscures the enemy, obscures their projectiles or the player just flat out can't see what is next.\r\nOri dies in a couple of hits from the enemies, and in one or two from traps. Health pickups are rare so the player will often will be running around at the brink of death anyways\r\nThis compared with the atrocious floaty controls, the \"mash the x button and pray, while trying to dodge the bullet hell\" combat makes the game infuriating.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a platformer or a story rich game. This is essentially a long gauntlet of traps and obstacles that are designed to kill you. Right from the start you have to make pixel perfect jumps, dodge enemy bullets and traverse long sections of what can only be described as trickshots to get to the next story point. Meanwhile, everything, and I mean everything is trying to kill you. Every section of the map is filled with brambles, laser beans, respawning monsters or some other nasty trap.\r\nThe brash mechanic sounds nice, looks cool, but they rely on it too much. Oh my, why do you have to put in long sections where the only way of traversal is to basically catch every projectile with brash, double jump, pray that the next projectile comes in time, time another brash... It is just bad.\r\n\r\nIn Hollow Knight you have such sections, but most of them are completely optional or there is more than one way to solve them. You have such high skill actions like brash, the pogo, but that is optional. Here it is mandatory. \r\n\r\nThere are some good ideas here, but the execution is terrible. I often felt that the game is hard, because otherwise it would have been too short, there isn't really much substance here. So the game was made hard, but then they realized it was too hard so they added the self save feature. Now the game could have become too easy, so they don't give you energy. Now you can't really use your energy for anything else, but saving otherwise you can (but will anyways), get into situations where you just somehow have to make an impossible sequence happen, because there is no other option.\r\n\r\nGiven the problems with the controls, the ruthlessness of traps and enemies, contrasted with the beautiful music and art style, the game is exceptionally dissonant. Angelic music plays while Ori gets destroyed by everything. My mind wants to relax to be tensed up by the gameplay, resulting in a very frustrating experience overall.\r\n\r\nCeleste is better for platforming, Dead Cells is better for combat and Hollow Knight is just flat out better overall.\r\n",

I got really invested in it almost immediately, and it only got better and more fun as the game-play continued on. The puzzles are rather good and although sometimes they had me really confused, if I just tried something different I'd eventually figure it out and then bring that experience along with me in the game. It took about 9 hours to complete my first run, and I can't wait to play it again to get all the achievements and explore the bits I never got around to.",

At the end I had over 600 deaths and while many of those can be attributed to me not playing many platformers most were just bc this game requires your movement to be precise and most things are one shots.\r\n\r\n### Gameplay\r\nI don't like the gameplay of this game. I had so many bugs and glitches that it made it less fun to play. Many of the talent tree options just didn't work and I felt like I wasted hard earned points. In addition to that I had many bugs where inputs would not register which would cause me to die. The combat felt like a worse version of Hollow Knight were it was basic and did not feel fluid.\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nmeh\r\n\r\n### Art\r\nThis game is beautiful. All of the background art is hand drawn which can cause problems gameplay wise. But artistically it is gorgeous, navigating the environment with a hand drawn image behind you. The music score also brings so much life to the game especially during the escape sequences.",

When you are going for the 'Unhinged' achievement, DO NOT restart a run on the same save file after you die. The game will tell you you're on One-Life difficulty and the save file will say One-Life but the game no longer considers it as a One-Life playthrough due to a bug. Delete the save file after you die and start a new one from scratch. I had to play through this whole game without dying TWICE just because a bug screwed me out of my achievement and if I can save just one of you from making that mistake then this review was worth writing.\n\nNow aside from torturtous achievements, Ori and the Blind Forest was a great game. It looks breathtaking, the movement/platforming is really fun and the story is beautiful. I can whole-heartedly recommend it.\n8/10 only because there wasn't a single enemy in the game that I didn't find annoying.",

I liked it so much that I ended up finishing the game and all achievements in only like 2 - 3 days.\n\nThe story is short but superb, the look of the game is great, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, the gameplay is extremely responsive and smooth, and all in all this is just such a fantastic experience.",

The controls are so tight, and so many movement options that need precise timing. Ori just moves around the map weaving around the plethora of enemy projectiles flying towards you. This game doesn't really have a \"combat\" system per say, you just go near the enemies and spam a close range spirit attack. Ori 2 adds a full blown combat system but Ori 1 mainly focuses on the platforming aspects. \n\nDefinitely play this before moving on to Ori Will of the Wisps because that game improves upon every aspect and it's hard to go back to this one afterwards.\n\n9.5/10",

At the time I had just finished Hollow Knights, a game I absolutely adore, so I was expecting something similar. unfortunately for me this game seems to focus more on platforming compare to combat. So as someone who enjoys the combat aspect of metroidvanias, this game left a lot to be desired. It wasn't an awful game so giving it a bad review wouldn't sit right with me, but it just wasn't the game for me.\n\n",

It will give about 15 hours of play at most, so you can decide if it is worth it or not. all around, this game has the best art and graphics I've ever seen in a video game. \r\nIt is fairly easy on normal mode and a slight challenge on hard (I died 300+ times, which may sound like a lot, but they fly right by). This was annoying to me, as I wish there could be a difficulty level between one life and hard. Unless you really like this game or want to speedrun it, this game has limited replayability.\r\nI would compare this game to Hollow Knight, but where every single area is the white palace.",

Played 1000's of games. Memorable experiences are rare but this, much like the best games, has several. \n\nMoments up there with the Pyshco Mantis scene, bricking myself as a teen when the dog jumped through the window in RE:1 or Aeris encounter with Sephiroth, my first Helldivers 2 drop or in Subnautica casually looting behind the Aurora (IYKYK) or... you get the picture, tis a great game just buy it.\n\n------\n[10/10 - Story] \n- Cry like a little girl.\n\n[10/10 - Graphics] \n- OLED TV + HDR + Philips Ambilight = An unforgettably beautiful experience.\n\n[10/10 Gameplay] \n- Even more enjoyable than 1992 Sonic was (as a 7 year old noob). \n\n[100/10 Music]\n- Phenomenal. Cannot think of a game with better music, not even FFVII. \n\n\nSummary.... \nThis game is not very summery, can be enjoyed like cereal (the superior gaming snack) - Anytime.\nThe platforming genre died years ago but this is fresh and fun so don't let it put you off. Just buy it and play to at least the top of the Ginso tree,.. Man, rushing to the top of that tree with THAT soundtrack... Wow.",

The level design is a bit bland, with having a fire, water and ice level, but nothing so eye-poppingly unique. It's a pretty hard game and the mechanic of you manually plopping down your save points is interesting enough, though sometimes troublesome if you run out of saves before the hard bit. If you like platformers - go for it, if not, you may want to hold off until a sale.",

The themes of this story are beautiful and very much themes around what it is currently happening with the world.\r\n\r\nI love this game and am really excited to play all there future games.",

The save mechanic took a bit of getting used to, its more of an added skill in terms of deciding when to save and when not to. Combat isn't crazy as this mostly a platforming gaming with only a couple attacks. I would especially recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed platforming or puzzle games, but anyone could enjoy this.",

There is satisfaction when you finish some difficult section. Especially 3 escape sequences.\n\nHowever this is also a game with most moronic save system ever invented - you have to spend energy point to create save point. You may ask: what's wrong with that? Unless you played the game before there is no way to predict where is the optimal place to save. Very often you will \"lock\" yourself long before difficult section, with no energy to save and low health. That means tons of repetitive, boring grind to finally make a \"miracle run\" and push further. You will waste hours of your life on pointless replays, especially in early game. Did I mention that saves use the same energy pool as attacks? Yes. It is THAT stupid...\n\nI don't mind difficulty. I don't mind required precision and reflex. I don't mind learning levels and timing. I'm giving this game a \"no\" [b]because of broken save and health system[/b]. If you play the game you will know what I mean - there are difficult games with good flow made of chain of well-designed challenges with autosaves between them. But here challenge (that is good on its own!) may become boring torment because you accidentally approached it on bad terms.",

Everything that was done in this game was done with a lot of love.  The music, the visuals, the story, the controls, everything is expertly and beautifully done.  The devs put their heart and soul into this one.  Someone looked at the Metroidvania genre and said \"Let's make this beautiful\".  That's not to say that other games in the genre aren't wonderful, but the devs of Ori were on a mission for this one.  And I really appreciate how approachable this game is.  The difficulty scales well with the game and while there are very challenging moments, nothing feels frustrating.  Also, the end of the game isn't the end of the game.  You really do want 100% this game.  And it's not all that difficult to do.  The main game took me about 15 hours to go through, and that was with some exploring but not a whole lot.  \r\n\r\nThe only thing I will say for people who have not played this is to know what to expect as you approach it.  The first, the story is a heart wrencher.  Like Pixar level heart breaking story.  The other is that this is not a game where you are a badass space bounty hunter, vampire hunter, or insect with a sword.  You're a gentle woodland spirit, and the game play reflects that.  So if you're expecting frantic combat game play, this is not that game.  Neither of those things are a negative.  You should just know what you're getting into.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Ori and the Blind Forest is absolutely worth the full price.  So go out there and play this one!",

        "review": "Lows outweighed the highs.\n\nI'm very conflicted with how I feel about this game.  On one hand, it has very stunning visuals, beautiful music, and a neat story at the start.  But then on the other hand, you have unforgiving chase scenes, a story that later loses its grip, and moments that make you wonder if the game was QA'd.  Overall I think 4.5/10 is my actual rating.\n\nIt had a really strong start, and I wish the effort that went into that carried throughout the rest of the game.  But it doesn't.  The story fades, and at the end I didn't even realize I had beaten it.  Leveling up doesn't matter since enemies/thorns get equally as strong too.  And thorns are EVERYWHERE for no reason.  The lowest points for me were by far the boss chase scenes.  If you die you have to start the whole chase scene over again.  And there's no way you could beat a chase scene without either A} dying a million times to learn what to do or B} having knowledge beforehand on where to go or what random rock is about to spike you from the sky.\n\nIn conclusion it wasn't a bad game, but definitely missed it's potential to be Hollow Knight status.  The lows outweighed the highs and for that reason I don't want to play it again nor would I recommend it to my wife.",

        "review": "Genuinely one of the most frustrating platformers I've ever played. I'm a big fan of \"difficult\" games, Dark souls, Hollow Knight, Elden Ring, etc. But this game's platforming and floating controls make it very difficult to actually enjoy, and the mechanic where players can choose where to save, while interesting and sometimes fun, and can also be very annoying, especially since it's tied to unlocking certain areas and also using special attacks. Balancing all those mechanics with the save system can make it difficult and frustrating to save at times, especially when traversing through difficult platforming sections. I've also found the game not very intuitive at times, which can lead to annoying sections where you die on repeat due to confusing sections of the game. Not to mention the artificial difficulty of many enemies. I actually quite enjoyed the enemy variety, the way the enemies and their attacks were blended into the platforming was actually quite cool, but I didn't enjoy the ridiculous tankiness of a lot of the enemies, which is made even worse by the frustrating placement and lack of move variety of the enemies. \r\n\r\nOverall a very frustrating and annoying game, the story seems really good, and the art is absolutely beautiful, but all of that is ruined by the rest of the game mechanics and ridiculous punishments for slight slip ups, (why does everything do so much damage so quickly? The lack of Iframes is confusing to say  the least) Chances are you might enjoy the game, I certainly did at times, but the overall experience was negative. I'm looking forward to any changes in the sequel.",

        "review": "9/10.\nA great matroidvania platformer with fantastic art style and soundtrack.\nI really loved the the platforming of this game. It requires just the right amount of precision and creative use of your given abilities. The main character Ori moves with great fluidity and the movement animation is just pristine.\nYou will die A LOT in this game, but I find the challenge to be fun and fair. Since you can save almost anywhere in the game, it also doesn't become tedious since you can try again right away.\nThe \"boss fights\" comes in the form of long escape sequences, which requires even greater precision. Since you are required to start from the beginning of these sessions, some may find these sessions too difficult or tedious. I personally really enjoyed these sequences and found them to be the highlight of the game by far.\nI played the original version first and then the definitive edition. The definitive edition adds two new areas with two new abilities along with a lot of QoL improvements, such as fast travel. The new abilities gives more freedom in the platforming and provides more solutions. However, since the other areas are not remade to accommodate for these new abilities, they sometimes trivialize some sections of the game. In that sense, I found the original game to be tighter on the platforming front.\nThe atmosphere of the game is phenomenal, with orchestral music paired with a unique and polished art style. Some of the cut scenes, enhanced by the somber music, are real tear-jerkers.\nWould recommend to anyone who enjoys challenging platforming.",

Wished they introduced these abilities sooner, because the feeling I got when playing through the beginning of the game is similar to watching YouTube shorts, not bored, but not having fun",

        "review": "This is a good, not a great game, but it has some serious stuff I hated.\r\n\r\nThe good: it's a beautifully realized world and exploration is generally fun, especially when you get all the traversal powers. There are some good puzzles that never took too long and blended with the platforming. You can save practically anywhere you want. You move quick enough and there are fast travel points that generally make re-visiting locations painless, except the water tree.\r\n\r\nThe bad: first, this is a pretty hardcore platformer disguised as a metroidvania. All those health upgrades and spirit upgrades don't mean anything in the many instant kill escape sequences, or to all the lava or even dirty water. It is also sometimes very unclear where to run when the murderous owl instant kills you for a single wrong step. This was on EASY! Maybe because I didn't start the game on easy.\r\n\r\nIt's a long stretch to reach the start of the game, and it involves you sometimes moving a character sometimes not. We don't need to slowly crawl, just show it. Similarly, at the end of the game you move a character a few feet and that's all you had to do. Just have the character show up.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of ambiguity around what you can climb, what will hurt you, what will kill you, and fighting enemies is easy but a cluster of light that you can't really tell what is going on. Many sequences require you to keep enemies alive to \"bash\" them, which is a traversal mechanic that probably should have stayed using static objects. Being able to throw enemies is sometimes fun though.\r\n\r\nThere's also no bosses to speak of. The platforming core of the game comes through when you have escape sequences that are quite tough.\r\n\r\nFinally, the story: [spoiler]The villain is the hero. Seriously, that light tree loses a leaf and because of that murders 3 baby owls. Why did that happen? That's a real jerk move on the part of the magic tree, and it doesn't even get Ori back. So Kuro taking the tree's power seems reasonable to me. Then when she sees all the danger and destruction she's caused she returns it and dies. Those tree spirits seem to come back to life, but not Kuro's babies.[/spoiler]",

It has this neat feature where you can save pretty much anywhere (assuming you have the resources for it), meaning you never lose too much progress so long as you don't forget to utilize it.\r\n\r\nThen the game throws a 5 minute escape sequence at you where you're not allowed to save. This kind of difficulty spike is unwarranted, unwelcome, and frankly, complete BS. Of course, the sequence is made even worse by the fact that the Bash ability frequently fails to lock on to targets, which will cost you your run. Spare yourself the frustration and find a better game to play.",

The save system was generous and flexible, which I appreciated with how easy it was to die in the many platforming sections. The boss battle-esque escape sequences were the only parts I found frustrating due to the mix of easy death, sense of time pressure, and lack of midway saves.\n\nUnsurprisingly, perfect on Steam Deck.",

        "review": "Review written after 38,8h.\n\nThis is one of the prettiest 2D/2.5D games I've ever played. A perfect game for the youngest, although the production can be irritating with its screwdriver. The story is not very ambitious but perfect for a younger audience.\n\nAdvantages:\n- The game lasts for a good 13h, but this time can be shortened if you do not collect all the items that strengthen the main character of OIR.\n- High level of difficulty despite choosing it.\n- The best element of this part are the escape sequences - uncompromising level of difficulty.\n- Character development elements - primitive simple three upgrade paths that can be maxed out at the end of the game.\n- The organic nature of the levels - I will sum it up with these words - Once you play this platformer, you will never want to play or look at primitive and angular platformers.\n- The narrator of the story is a nice addition, he does not stop the gameplay and speaks in a language invented by the creators.\n\nDefects:\n- The further you go into the forest, the more damage the spikes and flames cause. - Why don't they deal gogantic damage from the very beginning? (The sequel is also the same.)\n- Achievements such as complete the game in 3h. should not exist - Maybe I would turn a blind eye to it if the game were terribly linear, but it is not.\n- Four different difficulty levels - If there are more than three difficulty levels then the challenge is equivalent in every game.\n\nFinal Rating: 7/10.\n\n\n\nRecenzja napisana po 38,8h.\n\nTo jeden z najładniejszych gier 2D/2,5D jakie grałem. Idealna gra najmłodszych choć produkcja potrafi wkurzyć swoją śrubą. Historia nie jest bardzo mocno ambitna ale idealna dla młodszego odbiorcy.\n\nZalety:\n- Gra starcza na dobre 13h ale można ten czas skrócić jeśli nie zbiera się wszystkich przedmiotów które wzmacniają głównego bohatera OIR.\n- Wysoki poziom trudności mimo wyboru jego.\n- Najlepszy element tej części są sekwencje ucieczkowe - bezkompromisowy poziom trudności.\n- Elementy rozwoju postaci - prymitywne proste trzy ścieżki ulepszeń które można wymaksować pod koniec gry.\n- Organiczność poziomów - podsumuje to takimi słowani - Jak zagra się w tą platformówkę to nigdy nie będzie się chciało zagrać czy spojrzeć na Prymitywne I Kańciaste Platformówki.\n- Narrator opowieści jest fajnym dodatkiem, on nie stopuje rozgrywki i przemawia w wymyślonym języku przez twórców.\n\nWady:\n- Im dalej w las tym kolce i płomienie zadają coraz większe obrażenia. - Czemu od samego początku nie zadają one gogantycznych obrarzeń? (W kontynuacji też jest to samo.)\n- Osiągnięcia typu ukończ grę w 3h. powinny nie istnieć - Może bym przymknął na to oko gdyby gra była by strasznie liniowa, a nie jest.\n- Cztery różne poziomy trudności - Jeśli jest więcej niż trzy poziomy trudności to wyzwanie jest równoznaczne w każdej grze.\n\nOcena Końcowa: 7/10.",

Combat is bad... really, really bad; controls are flaky at best, and garbage at worst (now consider that there are multiple moments where the game needs PRECISE platforming and be prepared for a world of frustration). The save idea is horrible (you consume energy to save, so you save less; now imagine this in a game where you'll die a lot  because you don't know what you have to do, because spikes blend with the scenario, because you control didn't register or because your character decided to jump into the abiss for no reason, and you need to replay the whole section, WITH the unskipable cutscenes). \r\n\r\nGood visuals, but the game itself, not recommended.",

        "review": "Ori and the Blind Forest clearly resonates with a lot of people, and there's some good to be found here—the visuals are pleasing, the music is generally good (although I found the constant interweaving of the main theme into every track a little tiresome), and there are sections where, once you get the platforming down, it feels really good.\n\nHowever, I can't really bring myself to recommend this game.\n\nThere's a certain sense of \"imprecision\" to the controls at times which is kind of hard to explain (but which other reviewers have attested to already). For instance, there are a few places where you need to jump onto a pillar or other raised spot, and in most platformers, you'd just press in the direction of the raised spot and jump on it, but in Ori, you'll automatically jump *away* from the thing you're trying to jump on. It's not especially hard to make such jumps once you're aware of this, but it's counterintuitive and fussier than it ought to be. In general, it feels like the controls aren't designed to deal with the moments where you need to make a precise landing, and although the game is pretty generous with checkpoints (since it lets you make your own almost anywhere at the cost of some of your \"mana\"), I felt like I was dying a little more often than I should have been.\n\nThe combat isn't really a high point of the game. Ori defenders will say that the game \"isn't about combat,\" and to some extent, that's true (since there's more of a focus on exploration and precision platforming)... but it still *contains* plenty of combat, and it's not very good. Mostly you'll be just spamming the same homing attack over and over at a short distance from the enemy. You eventually get the ability to repel certain projectiles back at enemies, which is kind of cool, but it's not enough to turns things around, and the wimpy homing attack is still going to be your go-to at times, even as the enemies become total damage sponges in the late game.\n\nI think my biggest issue, though, is that the visuals, while beautiful to a spectator, don't always communicate information to the player as clearly as they could. Some enemies shoot projectiles that will leave fire or some other hazardous stuff on a platform, but it doesn't always stick out as clearly from the background as it could. There's one area late in the game where a slightly dull-colored water turns out to be acid that kills you instantly, but it's only slightly dull in appearance (and not, like, bubbly and bright green and flagrantly unsafe to touch). Heated floors that damage you as you stand on them are a little too subtle in their glowing animation; the first time you get hurt by them, it feels like a bit too much of a surprise. During the \"escape sequences\" at certain points, where the game switches heavily to a precision platforming focus (which, again, the controls don't always feel quite suited to), I had several points where I wasn't sure where I was supposed to jump next, and because I missed the narrow two-second window when I was supposed to do whatever, I died and had to repeat that section. It doesn't help that some of the encroaching hazards, like the rising water in the first escape sequence, actually move *faster* if you're doing better, taking away whatever extra time you would have otherwise gotten to think through the next step; this sort of \"rubber-banding\" feels antithetical to the design of a good escape sequence. Once you get those sections down, the flow feels pretty good, but it felt like I had to slog through too many \"gotcha\" moments for me to get there.\n\nAll this being said, there are clearly plenty of people who really like this game, and your mileage may certainly vary. I wouldn't say it's bad; it's just full of too many little annoyances that start to add up by the end, and having completed it once, I don't think I'll be going back to it again.",

I have played maybe 5 hours of Hollow Knight, and a couple of other demos.\nStraight away, I was blown away by the artistic vision and music. It was such a beautiful experience.\nI was happy to see the addition of an easy difficulty, as I would have struggled a lot.\nEven then, the platforming sections were intuitive and fun to get through. With the tad occasions where the solution felt a bit incongruous.\nThe story itself was simple, but heartwarming.\nMap design was great, and easy to get around.\nOverall such a great experience.\nHighly recommend",

I have gotten to the volcano part where you are being chased by the owl, i dont really feel much of a reason to continue playing as i feel as if i've sunk enough hours into the game. The completionist in me might come back and finish it but it really wasnt that great as far as games go. solid 6/10, not worth your time in my opinion.\n\nEdit: Just finished the game and the ending is very satisfying and i feel as if i wouldn't be doing the game justice without mentioning that. 7/10.",

The mesmerizing soundtrack perfectly complements the atmosphere, further enriching the experience.\nWhile the game is ideal for grabbing and playing in short bursts, be prepared for time to melt away as you get engrossed in Ori's journey. However, it's important to note that the challenging platforming might require some adjustment for newcomers to the genre. Easy mode is a great option for those unfamiliar with this style of gameplay.\nEven if you're not a die-hard fan of platformers, Ori and the Blind Forest is a masterpiece worth owning, especially when on sale. The combination of its enchanting story, breathtaking visuals, and captivating soundtrack makes it an unforgettable experience.",

The boss fights are easy and boring (tbh i wouldn`t call them fights,), there is literally like 7 types of mobs that can perform only one type of attack. Cut scenes are way to long (and boring).

I also love how you're naturally just really fast, i love SPEED!\n\nThe game also looks beautiful which is a nice bonus and the map is really nice too. You get a pretty good amount of that classic backtracking metroidvania thing, or you could just not do that that much if you want and just have a nice progression.\n\nGreat game took me around 9 hours to complete just chillin yaknow, probably will go back for a Hard mode run and maybe 100% more areas and stuff.\n\nWould recommend,\nshane5 signing out",

        "review": "Really only putting recommended since there isn't anything in between\n\nThe game uses movement-based progression (subjective) like hollow knight, metroid demon's crest etc. Essentially, as you progress in the game, you get more abilities that help you traverse the game. However, some of the abilities just lose their usability and only exist to bar you from certain areas.\n\nThe Gameplay\nThe game is a platformer, do not focus on the combat; the combat is pretty bland and repetitive. You're playing this game for the platforming\nPersonally I didn't find the platforming as hard as I wanted it to be. If you aren't very well versed in platformers ~~or don't particularly like them~~, you'll probably enjoy the game more.\nThe difficulty setting only affects the damage you take, so there isn't much of a difference between the difficulties depending on how good you are.\nThe game is also VERY forgiving. You can save almost wherever you are, making it a great platformer for beginners\n\nOH YEAH THE STORY I FORGOT ABOUT THAT\nUhhhh it wasn't very noticeable, I guess you could find it heartwarming??? The game doesn't really try to engage you in the story and nor is there enough character development to feel anything. You SORT OF have to assume and make up the story in your head if you really want to feel the impact. \nHopefully the sequel will handle the story better? I still haven't played at the time of writing this review.\n\n\nOverall, it's a pretty mid game IN MY OPINION. If you're new to platformers it's a pretty good introduction to them. It's a simple and (debatably) easy platformer that is also very forgiving. (that is unless you go to places you really shouldn't be going to)",

        "review": "[i] Ori and the Blind Forest [/i] is a game that combines fairy tale aesthetics with hardcore Metroidvania gameplay; its art is unquestionably supreme, and its level design is horrifyingly hellish. Do not get me wrong, because I liked the gameplay a lot. What I mean by 'horrifyingly hellish' is that the level design consists of so many different kinds of puzzles and traps that there is not a single one-for-all solution for the challenges presented in the game. Jumping and running without thinking won't help you no matter how many skills you unlock. You have to constantly observe situations and adapt accordingly, which is without a doubt a solid proof of the excellent craftsmanship of the developers. I can see that they are seriously committed to the best of the best gameplay experiences they can offer.\n\nThat being said, this game has pretty straight-forward, and fairly predictable storyline. The developers did their best to maximize the dramatic effect of the story with their supreme art style and excellent camerawork, but the story itself is nothing special. Maybe this was intentional because this simplicity of the writing makes the audience feel like reading a fairy tale. Still, it's a solid conclusion that they did not invest as much effort into the writing of this game.\n\nIf you are looking for a game featuring the greatest kind of Metroidvania gameplay experience with stunning visuals, I recommend this game without a moment's hesitation. If you are someone just wanting to chill out and relax, go find some other game. This game might look all sweet and kind on its cover, but beneath it lurks a monstrosity ready to pressure your brain in every direction at the earliest opportunities; challenge it only when you are ready to fight.",

It's not enough to have it only in one console. \n\nThis game is a masterpiece, insanely wellcrafted, great soundtrack, excelent storyline, very VERY dificult to master, but at the same time friendly to players. \n\nThe graphics will make you stare at your screen wondering how could someone make a game this beautiful. \n\nI will always be grateful to had the curiosity to buy it (as a metroidvania games addicted), this is one of the best games I've played for sure. \n\nIt looses only to it's sequel, that was somehow able to make it even better. \n\nJust buy it, even it's 1000 bucks. It's the best spent money ever. 10/10.",

Everything is perfect, the emotional story, the narrative, the game mechanics, the map, the 2.5D concept, the way this game needs to be played is wonderfull. You are this little magic creature that's dropped in a magic world that needs to be saved. The story is incredible and full of emotional moments. The powers that you discover on the way.. the movements of the character.. the game mechanics... are incredible. The music leaves you breathless.. The whole game environment is done brilliantly, is really awersome just looking at it. \n11/10 on everything.",

        "review": "[h1]Quality on every front, flowered with incredible amounts of beautiful charm.[/h1] \n\nOri and the Blind Forest is a great gameplay, aesthetic and story experience. There is not much lacking in Moon Studios’ metroidvania. \n\nThe story follows Ori and Naru living a quiet, undisturbed life somewhere deep in the forest of Nibel. Once the forest [strike]starts dying[/strike] goes blind and does not bear fruit anymore, Ori leaves his only family and embarks on a journey to save the magical woods. While he makes new friends, he does also brave many dangers and the game’s main antagonist - Kuro. \nThe game has a few cutscenes. Sein is guiding our character through the game and the narrator that is supposed to be the light-god I guess, gives the broader context of the world. But beside him and Sein speaking in their funky language that is just subtitled on the screen, there is not much dialogue. Even if it’s just a few cutscenes and the story is not that long, the careful combination of music and aesthetic makes the way how it is presented a very beautiful plot. \nWhile ultimately the story revolves around the idea of maternal love, I also view it as a parallel to good and bad. One of the interpretations of the Yin-Yang motive you can make is that even in the absolute evil you will find a crumb of good and vice versa. The idea that the darkness is evil and the light is good loses its meaning once given proper context and perspective. \n\nOri’s moveset starts with simple jumps, but with time it evolves into a very dynamic and flexible system. While the game doesn’t do anything too original besides the bash, an ability letting you bounce off enemies and their projectiles in whatever direction you want resetting your double jump, the quality of all the moves and how you can chain them in combos makes platforming with Ori very enjoyable. The game rewards skill and thoughtful usage of its moveset. \nThroughout the map you can find several types of collectibles – life cells, energy cells as well as experience and free ability points. The skill tree branches into 3 paths – combat, utility and efficiency. Leveling and unlocking the new abilities is fun and useful. \nIn terms of combat, it starts with this weak flame homing-missile attack. Progressing through the game rewards you with stomp and charge jump. Once you unlock these the game encourages you to mix those attacks together in explosive combos, because the basic attack, even if upgraded, can take too long to kill the endgame enemies. \n\nThe game looks amazing, the hand-painted environments, playing with colors and shadows makes this production a very aesthetic and eye-pleasing experience. Any screenshot of this game could be my wallpaper. \nThe sound design has the proper oompf!, you can feel the power surging when you level up or smite the enemies or stomp your way forward. But the game’s score is something else. I needed to look up a fancy, new word to describe the music for that game – and it’s [b][i]amazeballs[/i][/b] it seems. It’s a great part of this production’s identity and success. It complements the aesthetic and story of this game perfectly. Fav tracks would be [i]Up the Spirit Caverns Walls[/i], [i]Returning to the Spirit Tree[/i] and [i]Light of Nibel[/i] as it is the ending theme of course. \n\nThe definitive edition adds two new areas to explore and two new abilities for you to utilize. Additionally, it makes some quality-of-life improvements and adds some general polish to the game. \n\nI can for sure say that Ori and the Blind Forest is one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. Its picturesque graphics, amazing soundtrack, moving story and enjoyable platforming make this production worth playing for everyone. The game’s level of quality shows itself on every front, with every aspect of the game being at least very good. You can really feel talented hearts put into this work. \nAlso it seems like a good starter for somebody new to video games. Engaging, easy to learn-hard to master and it does not require some crazy tier hardware.",

        "review": "i enjoyed hollow knight, and I was looking for a metroidvania, if your in the same boat as me and you are wondering if this game is better or worse or a lil bit like hollow knight il talk about it. I also bought the bundle which comes with both the sequel and the definitive edition of blinding forest.\n\nThings Ori did better than Hollow knight-\n1. Movement: the movement in this game is very smooth and enjoyable, and the game uses it to great extent.\n\n2. graphics: although hollow knight has great stylized graphics, this game overall looks great,\n\n3. Platforming: the game has great movement and it also uses the great movement in boss fights, most of the boss fights in this game are heavily platforming focused. a lot like the game Celeste. \n\n4. Puzzles: Hollow knight lacked a lot of puzzles, which this game has a lot. There are a few puzzles that just get annoying after a while but at least they have puzzles. \n----------\nThings Hollow knight did better than Ori and the blinding forest,\n-combat: overall in terms of combat the game was lacking and hollow knight easily takes combat\n\n-world building: I think the world is great and has wasted potential. the world is easily 2x the size of hollow knight but some areas simply seem dead and nothing seems to be going on in the areas.\n\n-enemy variation: the enemy variation is very lacking, most of the time different regions just have re-skinned versions of previous enemy you encounter.\n\nGame Length- now its no question that this game is shorter than hollow knight, and I don't think there was any way they could make the game as long as hollow knight, but I beat the game in about 13 hours with 70% completion. I was missing a great sum of hp and the blue things. I also missed 2 abilitys somehow? which my friend pointed out. A dash would have been helpful. \n\n------\nshould you buy this game? \n- yea, it satisfied me for the most part, the game lacks combat but is overall a way more chill and laid back experience compared to hollow knight, \n-I would also buy the bundle, although I have not played the second game, I think it is a overall upgrade compared to blinding forest, although I have not played will of the wisps yet. \n\n------------\n\n",

        "review": "Ori and the Blind Forest is an absolute masterpiece of a game, and it's easy to see why it's become a favorite for so many gamers. From its breathtaking visuals to its emotionally resonant storytelling, every aspect of this game is crafted with care and attention to detail.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's talk about the visuals. The hand-painted art style is absolutely stunning, with vibrant colors and lush environments that draw you into the world of Nibel. Every frame of this game feels like a work of art, and it's clear that a lot of love went into creating each and every pixel.\n\nBut Ori and the Blind Forest isn't just a pretty face – it also has a compelling story to tell. The narrative follows Ori, a small guardian spirit, as they embark on a quest to save their home from an encroaching darkness. Along the way, they'll encounter a cast of memorable characters, each with their own motivations and struggles. The story is told primarily through visual storytelling and environmental cues, which adds an extra layer of depth to the experience.\n\nOf course, no discussion of Ori and the Blind Forest would be complete without mentioning its gameplay. At its core, this is a platformer with Metroidvania elements, and it excels in both departments. The controls are tight and responsive, allowing for precise movement and platforming challenges that are both challenging and rewarding. The addition of abilities that can be unlocked and upgraded as you progress adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, giving you new ways to traverse the environment and overcome obstacles.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive thing about Ori and the Blind Forest is its emotional impact. This is a game that knows how to tug at your heartstrings, with moments of joy, sorrow, and everything in between. The relationship between Ori and their adoptive mother, Naru, is particularly touching, and there were more than a few moments that brought a tear to my eye.\n\nIn conclusion, Ori and the Blind Forest is a truly special game that deserves all the praise it has received and more. Its stunning visuals, compelling story, and tight gameplay come together to create an experience that is as unforgettable as it is beautiful. If you haven't had the chance to experience it for yourself, I highly recommend giving it a try – you won't be disappointed.",

Once I got used to the movement (and got more skill upgrades) it was a lot more fun and way easier to navigate the world.\nSimple but powerful storytelling, a great antagonist, fun puzzles and exploration, exhilarating escapes with a light dose of difficulty. Absolutely recommended.",

I own both Ori titles on Steam, Xbox and Switch and have all the achievements for the first game on the last two platforms which just leaves the Steam version and I'll get to that one of these days. The point is Ori and the Blind Forest is a solid Metroidvania that has pretty much everything I want from the genre, a beautifully realized world with adorable and lovable characters and wonderful traversal mechanics as you explore and unravel the mysteries of the forest. Overall Ori as a character and as an IP means a lot to me and about the only negative thing I can say about this game is that the combat can be a bit repetitive though there are more options than people often realize. If you like Metroidvanias with quick and nimble movement and are into the more fantasy and magic oriented setting I would definitely recommend giving Ori a shot though as I established at the beginning I would probably recommend it to everyone anyway. Ori is usually pretty affordable too so even if there isn't a sale you won't be breaking the bank",

        "review": "An absolute classic in metroidvania platformers. Though the difficulty gets a bit challenging towards the end, it was fun the whole way through and ends at the perfect time. The level design never feels repetitive and always challenge the player in unique ways that never overstay their welcome. The puzzles were just challenging enough for you to feel like you were using your brain, but not much more. Both the visual and auditory aspects shine brightly and make the game an absolute wonder to experience. The story is a bit basic, but I feel a more complex story would have just bogged it down. Even with 100% completion, I never felt like it was a slog and never felt I was wasting my time grinding. My only complaint is that there's 0 replayability. this game would severely benefit from a ng+. other than that, a beautiful (and beautifully frustrating) game that will be remembered as a classic for generations to come.",

Hace el juego muchísimo más llevadero. En [i]Hollow Knight[/i], por ejemplo, una vez morí 2 veces y perdí muchiiiiiiisimos puntos que tenía acumulados. [strike]Putee un poco xD[/strike]\n\n3) [u][b]ME ENCANTA[/b][/u] que puedas guardar cuando quieras y donde quieras, siempre y cuando no haya enemigos cerca. Nuevamente, comparándolo con el [i]Hollow Knight[/i], por ejemplo, que sólo tenias checkpoints en los banquitos y en lugares específicos.\n\nEse último es un punto [b]importantísimo[/b] para mí, porque odio morir muchísimo en los juegos. Me hace sentir que \"pierdo el tiempo\". Ese sentimiento empeora muchísimo si, encima, cada vez que muero tengo que caminar una banda hasta el lugar donde me mataron. Tener el checkpoint o guardado ahí al lado, mejora [u]DEMASIADO[/u] la situación, al menos para mí.\n\nEn fin, éste es un juegazo. Lo disfruté de principio a fin y lo recomiendo a todo el mundo.",

WotW is a masterpiece that does everything that this original does, and infinitely better at that.\n\nThere's a number of incredibly glaring game design flaws in this original, but the biggest one of them all is the lack of auto-saves. In a game that is all about surviving hazardous environments. To save your game you need to get and use Energy to create a manual save point on the map. Obtained this one item but made a wrong step or got hit by a stray mob projectile? Have fun doing everything **again** from where you last saved and acquiring it again - or going out of your way to find an energy cell somewhere so that you can create another save point further ahead. And believe me, you need a save a **lot** - everything either hurts like a truck or one-shots. You can easily get stuck in one segment for hours upon hours because you have a save point with 1hp in the middle of another endless corridor of one-shot hazards. \n\ntl;dr Ori WotW is a fantastic game. Don't sully your experience by playing the original.",
