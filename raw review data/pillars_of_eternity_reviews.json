        "review": "The combat was fun, had me put in 50-something hours in just for the experience of the semi-turn-based bashing. But the gearing/looting system is so poor! All the items are the same, they just get class specializations and a few common modificators that up their stats, that's it! Did I perhaps miss every good \"artifact item\"? And the ones I *did* find were slightly above default inventory at best!... The only nice rewards from the entire playing experience were a sometimes half-decent story (maybe I didn't get to the \"good bit\" yet) and the process of combat itself. Oh, and I guess upgrading your fortress is fun for a bit, a shame it gets so tedious quick and the rewards quickly stop being exciting.",

Difficulty is fair, makes you study what you are fighting and how to beat it so its not just going in with your sword, you need to think a bit for some ennemies and the use of food or potions is a must at some higher difficulties. Story is good with many options and path to naviguate it. If you are like me and enjoy a good RPG where you need to think a bit then go for it.",

I'm using headcannon to romance her, since that's not an option in the actual game. There's no romance, as far as I can tell. \n\nSo much of the game could be described as \"not stupid\" - a commodity which sometimes seems in short supply in media. If you like depth and you have patience, I definitely recommend picking this up. I'm stoked for Avowed :)\n\nEdit: I should add though, I'm not a fan of some of the aspects of combat. I hate how there are like TEN BILLION different conditions that all boil down to some variation of \"stunned\" or \"dazed\" or \"paralyzed\" and so on. You have to hover over Durance's 400 spells one by one to see if you have a counter to that particular condition. Also characters have lots of interesting defensive capabilities, but they get pummeled so fast (and get \"dazed etc.\" so often), they frequently can't use them before getting KO'd. I find myself lowering the difficulty again... and again... just because combat is getting too annoying and time-consuming.",

        "review": "An amazing and memorable RPG. The highlight of the game for me was the amazing world Obsidian made for this game. The lore of Eora is really cool and has a lot of depth and thought put into it. What was also fantastic was the way most of the side quests tied in to the game's world/lore in some way. It made the experience so much more immersive and made most the side quests feel worthwhile, even the smaller and more \"insignificant\" ones. I think the way the main quest ties into the lore is great too. It is a bit slower paced and the start, but it goes to some crazy places, asking questions about the nature of gods and theology, the nature of the soul and more. I also loved how the game uses its lore to explain how many of the classes work. Great stuff. \r\n\r\nIt must be noted however that if you don't like reading a lot, DO NOT buy this game. I love reading myself, so I loved it, but it is very wordy so do keep that in mind. It's lore dense and deep, but a lot of that is in written form. There is voice acting (which is largely great) but a lot of text is not voiced. This didn't bother me at all, but this may be a turn off to some people.\r\n\r\nOutside of that, I think the gameplay is really fun, challenging and strategic and kept me interested the whole way through. The character creation and progression is great and very impactful every time you level up. The characters are mostly excellent, especially the priest Durance and wizard Aloth, among other memorable characters. Some were a bit less memorable but overall very solid.  \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the main story takes its time to get truly going. I think the White March DLC is better than anything in the base game. It's really good and should be experienced, but its placing in the main story is a bit awkward. It cannot be done after the game is finished, and it doesn't really fit storywise anywhere in the base game. \r\n\r\nYou also often have to mircomanage your party, especially party members that do a lot of casting. This could get a little tedious, since the AI when left automated kinda sucked, so managing them was often necessary.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a brilliant RPG. Well written, fun and immersive. \r\n",

Unlike a lot of RPGs I didn't feel put off if I didn't quite have the skills for a speech or action check as there were often multiple paths and you're never fully blocked off. The companions are very engaging and I greatly enjoyed their interactions in quests, it's a shame some didn't have more and that you could only have six companions.\r\n\r\nThe combat seemed almost too simple at first, however as you level up and unlock more spells/prayers for any wizards or priests in party things develop more. There was some very engaging combat and I enjoyed altering companion gear over time to fight what I wanted them to do, there are some things that aren't as good but, especially on normal, lots of styles are viable and there's no clear OP item a lot of the time.\r\n\r\nProbably my one criticism is quite a specific one, and that's that whilst it seems they try to have the game in a sort of 16th/17th century-esque setting what with arquebusses, blunderbusses and pistols other parts struggle to get away from the typical medieval fantasy aspects what with kite shields and the like. I wish there had been a more concerted effort to have a 16th century arms and armour feel to the game which I feel would've made it more refreshing and stand out in that aspect versus other fantasy RPGs.",

I almost gave up on this one as I only had one other party member and was getting wrecked by the monsters.\r\n\r\nThe game's companion AI system is fair but you will really want to order your party to cast buffs and debuffs yourself to avoid them being squandered on random monsters and then having none available on a harder monster or boss.",

        "review": "I'm trying so hard to enjoy this game, but it really does feel unfinished. \r\n\r\nThe story is paper thin, and little is done to endear you to any character, or place.  Half the dialog is voiced, and half of it's not, which is incredibly odd when you're interacting with NPCs.  Parts of the conversation are voiced, and others aren't.  The inconsistency is bizarre, and any action described by the \"DM\" or narrator is not voiced.  As a result, you're often reading action descriptions in between lines of spoken dialog.  The voice recordings do not have a break for these descriptions so you're either reading these sentences while trying to listen to the voice actor's lines, or going back and reading them after.  I found this so off-putting, I turned the voices off and just read everything.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of reading - I love reading, but there are blocks of text in this game that are so tedious and pointless.  You play as a \"watcher,\" which is someone who sees into people's souls I guess.  In looking around town trying to track down an NPC I needed to complete an early quest, I was bombarded with pages of text from half the people I tried to talk to.  It's not helpful dialog, it's their whole life story.  I just wanted to ask where Nonton was, man.  After a while it became clear this was all drivel, and I just stopped talking to people.  The sound design upon these interactions is also incredibly annoying to me.  Having the sound muffled every time a player tries to speak with one of these people is a seriously poor choice.\r\n\r\nAll that said, the worst aspect of this game so far is the combat.  It's an absolute dumpster fire.  It's boring to watch, and boring to play.  The effectiveness of any spell or action is unclear, and navigating between characters and their abilities is tedious.  It's unclear what benefits different types of armor have.  Some armor, like helmets, seem purely cosmetic.\r\n\r\nThe only things I've enjoyed are the art and music.  The music is peaceful, and the Foley for the character's movement during exploration is nice.  It's relaxing to walk around.  \r\n\r\nI've heard the story and characters are much better in the sequel, and it looks like they implemented a turn-based option, so hopefully it's more engaging.",

The regular dialogue was a wall of text. Do I really need to read a description of what the speaker is doing with his hands? Or the color and shape of his pipe? I'm pretty sure I didnt buy PoE the book.\nAll the characters are un-likeable and long winded, the plot is stupid, you have gods yelling at you. No freedom of choice. Combat mechanics are obtuse.\nEvery second I played this I just kept thinking I would rather be playing Baldurs Gate 2. For a game that came out in 2015, this would not have been in the top 10 games of the year 2000.",

        "review": "Amazing game so far, have 188 hours logged so far and will likely have more before I finish my second playthrough. Prior to playing this game I wasn't really fond of CRPGs having played pathfinder and not enjoyed it because it required such a degree of min-maxing (and the story itself felt bland and uninspiring if I'm being honest). \r\n\r\nThis game has much less of a difficulty floor, and it has a more interesting and engaging lore behind it. I found myself easily enthralled very early into my first playthrough by the story and background of the world of Eora. Do be warned though, if you want to play this game I hope you like READING because it has a lot of lore dumps in conversations and throughout the world. I personally am an avid reader so I don't mind, but you may if you don't.\r\n\r\nThe game also has excellent sound design! \r\n\r\nOverall, if I had to rate the game out of 10 I would give it a 9 out of 10, and that's only me deducting one point just to be fair. I LOVE Pillars of Eternity, and I think the PoE franchise is Obsidians best IP and game so far.",

The story isn't that bad but the way obsidian tries to build the universe in this game is confusing and doesn't make you want to pry deeper early on. The gameplay just sucks; you either turn the difficulty of the game down, or every single encounter is a mess of constantly pausing and micromanaging your characters positions and action bars. And this wouldn't even be such a terrible sin if every map wasn't FILLED with combat encounters; it's like they decided that good pacing wasn't important for the game. Overall, it's just not worth the  time sink if you're newer to these types of games.",

        "review": "I can't say anything about the game's content. All I can say is the UI is wonky. As alluring as it seemed to be on first glance, I got quickly stuck setting up my hotkeys and realizing there's a lot to be fixed.\n\nAt the start, you learn about how to select your party members, [1] selects the first, [2] the second hero. Then that didn't work for me anymore, with [1] selecting the first and [2] also selecting the first hero. I tried to work around this by setting [2] to \"Next Hero\", so I thought [1] would select the first hero and [2] would then switch through the heroes. Turns out [2] then reliably selected the second hero and [1] reliably selected the first hero. I set it back to its previous value and it was like before. Then I set it back to [2] selecting the next hero again but it stopped working entirely. Also, I got caught in a loop confirming that I wanted to save changes, where I had to click \"No\" to have my changes saved because \"Yes\" would show me the confirmation dialog again.\n\nBefore that, there have been other confusing things, such as [Alt] being usable to toggle highlighting, but not to highlight, whereas [Tab] was usable for both. Both left and right mouse buttons would select and move characters and I wanted to have one select, the other move. I set the left mouse button to select, so it didn't move anymore. I set the right mouse button to move, so it would move, but it also selected heroes I clicked on.\n\nIt does suck a bit to leave a negative review because the game seemed to hold premise and the reviews speak of amazing content, but outside of an early access title, my standard is that most controls should work and only have a few manageable oddities at worst. Keys not working, the interface buttons not working, that's just not good practice.\n\nBy the way, if there is a 3rd party fix everyone knows about, like \"why would you play without the community mod that fixes all those bugs\", I'd be open to hear about it, although I'm of the opinion that bugfixes should be part of the base game.",

For sure it takes some getting used to, as crpgs go, this game's accessibility is on the low end. It took me three tries to finish this game originally, but it's worth every hour. With a fantastic, varied, and interesting cast of characters to support your endeavors, this game is a gem. If you're new or the game's leveling/building seems way too complicated, absolutely find a build online. There's a plethora of them and once you find one that resonates you'll be utterly absorbed. The reputation system in the game is incredibly thoughtful, and something I'd love to see more of in other titles, give it a shot.",

But who's combat, movement system, endless reading, upgrades, actual implementation, etc bored me. Fundamentally this seems to be a style of game that does not appeal to me. Pillars of Eternity, as a successful attempt to capture that feeling, does not work for me. If you know you like these type of games, give it a shot. If you know you dislike them, you're unlikely to become a convert.",

The lore is heavily front-loaded, so I recommend spending some time looking up these terms on the wiki. It really helps you understand and appreciate the story.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that Animancer, Watcher, Cipher, and Chanter are different roles, but they're not mutually exclusive. A character or NPC can embody one or even a mix of all these roles simultaneously.",

        "review": "The Lore:\nI know the game is lore heavy but I had no idea the amount of information that would be thrown at me upon starting the game. Took like 2 hours to just create my character. I didn't realize I'd have to read a book worth of lore and how stats worked (I still don't fully understand it) to understand what anything was. There is lore in the lores lore in this game. Jesus... Everything has a back story. Even random villagers have paragraphs of backstory that is needed for a single thing in game.\n\nCharacter Creation:\nCharacter creation would be alright if it wasn't for the fact that when you customize your character you cannot set a custom image of it in the HUD. Every image is a static pre-made image so if you create a character with custom features it wont reflect in their portrait... Why is that a thing?\n\nVoice Overs:\nThe voice overs are hit and miss. One part will be voiced, then not, then voiced, then a lot will not be voice, then a random section will be voice, and then back to not being voiced... All in the same interaction. With dialogue heavy games like this it really needs to be fully voiced. Some 10 minute long dialogues are right before boss fights too. So if you die you have to click back through it.\n\nThe Fort:\nI spent hours and hours on building my fort and spent all my money just for the first raid to wipe out every... single... building... WHY CAN IT DO THAT! I spent like 5000 coins and you have to rebuild ALL of it. And enemies don't respawn that I've seen in 17 hours to be able to farm money. That is brutal!\n\nLeveling:\nThis game has the slowest leveling system I have ever seen in a game. I spent almost 20 hours and I'm level 4. FOUR!!! And when you do level up it's not even worth the time it took to get that level because the skills are mostly \"per rest.\" I put 20 hours into the game and I'm only on the 2nd spell book out of 10........ This game is waaaaaaaaay to long. I can't spend 500 hours in one game playthrough.\n\nSkills:\nMost skills are \"per rest\" rather than \"per encounter.\" The difference is that after you use your \"per rest\" skills you can't use them again until you go all the way back to an inn to sleep or use up a camp. You have to stop playing the game and leave the area to refill your skills after every... single... battle... Especially on higher difficulties. Your healer skills? Per rest... Your mage skills? Per rest... Later in the game the lowest level spells become \"per encounter\" but that's near the end of the game!!! I'm 20 hours in and STILL at \"per rest\" for my magic. I can't stand that mechanic and am dumbfounded that was a feature someone implemented and thought would be fun for players.\n\nWhat the most frustrating feature about skills is that you get basically 1 or 3 skills to use per character when the game has like 100 or so to choose from. The level cap is 12 and you don't even get to pick a skill every level for your class. Every other level you can pick a skill not based off your class but you shouldn't because you need the passive buffs that the game offers you instead. Which is also available to every class. So what the absolute fuck is even the fucking point in having that many skills in the game when you can only use like 1 or 2 of them and they can only be used just one time!!!!!!!!! THAT'S HORRIBLE GAME DESIGN!!!!!\n\nDo you like to debuff your opponents to give yourself a strategic advantage in battle? Well fuck you because debuffs in the game have accuracy. I'd say debuffs land maybe 50% of the time and last a measly 10 seconds on average if they land. Also they are mostly \"per rest.\" Also enemies tend to not care that they are debuffed and just slaughter you anyways so have fun wasting your time on them like I did. I can't think of single case I encountered where debuffing was more advantageous than just attacking.\n\nCombat:\nI liked it at first but there are so many issues. I played it on hard and it's about impossible to keep your party alive. Every class feels weak and has only a sliver of skills. I avoid all skills that are \"per rest.\" All mages skills are per rest also so after you use your allotted casts you are basically worthless. WHY!? Fight one battle, rest, fight one battle, rest, fight one battle....... Just sucks the fun right out of it.\n\nIt's essential to have a tank but if there is a mage enemy and it targets your tank well you're basically screwed. I thought having my own mage would be great until I discovered you have friendly fire. The enemies just gaggle around your characters so how the hell am I supposed to AoE them without killing my own people? The battle becomes chaos immediately so you can't really even use AoE spells. They generally hit just one enemy so why even AoE in the first place?\n\nClasses:\nI've found that every class except a Fighter with a shield is made of brittle glass. I thought having a Paladin would be an asset... No... They absolutely suck and do far worse than a Fighter. You'd think Paladins having healing abilities would come in handy well guess what... Fighters have plenty of healing abilities so it makes Paladins obsolete. If you don't stack Deflection on your one handed shield style class, you die... Don't duel wield, don't two hand, don't punch with a Monk. Get a Fighter with a shield and the entire rest of your party should be ranged attacks. Stupid game design...\n\nI made an Archer and thought that a range class would be a great strategical asset... Hell no it wasn't. Virtually no skills and very weak. The skills they have are useless and \"per rest\" with only one use. They get a pet in battle and I can say without a doubt they are useless. They have no skills and just serve as enemy fodder and die almost instantly when attacked. I ended up giving the Archer a Gun and the damage improved but the DPS was so slow it still wasn't worth it.\n\nChanters are completely worthless. They have to spend roughly 20 seconds in battle chanting to activate just ONE attack. ONE!!! And you'd think the skill would be worth the wait but no... It isn't... You can summon skeletons to help you but they do like 2 or 3 damage per hit and die faster than the Archers pet. Other debuffs for NPCs last like 10 seconds and don't do anything to turn the tide of battle. Besides most battles are over before the Chanter can even use a single skill. Just don't use a Chanter.\n\nGuess what? Healers are basically useless as well since their skills are \"per rest.\" Oh you healed three times last battle? Well guess you are done having fun then. Go all the way back to town and sleep to get those spells back. Repeat, repeat, and repeat. That's not role play... That's just fucking annoying.\n\nItems:\nI'm sure items may get more plentiful later in the game but wow are they rare. Like potions are so rare that I'm scared to use them. Then when I do they are barely effective. Ever played a game where you can't drink potions in battle? This is the first for me. You have to be out of battle to drink a potion.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have played it on hard. I don't know. This is actually just scratching the surface with the issues I had with this game. After I lost my entire fort I was done with the nonsense. This game isn't for me at all.",

        "review": "I was intrigued by the character build system, but I found the game play uninteresting. There did not seem to be much strategy, other than maybe choosing your skills and equipment well. For instance, it seems almost impossible to kite or separate enemies. Not as in hard to figure out, just mechanically impossible. The world and quests also seems pretty linear, without much in the way of exploration options. Once you hit a hard spot, it's tough to go to other places to level up, find better equipment or new companions. On the plus side, I did like the music and the world in general. The mood was terrifically dark. Just couldn't get into the mechanics.",

        "review": "Excuse my English because Im not a native speaker. \n\nFirst the PROs\n-Lovely isometric visuals and music\n-Interesting Lore which takes you one step at a time through the history, traditions, etcetera.\n-Interesting idea of classes: not the basic as ranger, warrior, wizard, etc, but also the monk, the bard and others.\n\nNow the CONs\nI come from other rpg games which are lot more like hack and slash, turn based or even text, but I have only played one -which also didnt quite find as epic- in which the spells would also have friendly fire. That's a big con... what's the purpose of having wizards and using their spells if you are going to kill/damage your party?\n1. Friendly fire with spells\n\nAlmost all games I have played let you know what to do, what do expect, how to rest, how to cure yourself, what these bar means, how to use a class? Well, there are those which doesnt help you and you have to guess. If you think you are an expert guesser on the how-to-do-this or that, please, play this game.\n2. No tutorial.\n\nAs you come from the no tutorial thing, you will find yourself with ... an inventory, but then with your stash, which it seems you are permanently carrying around. its seems, after 9 hours of playing this, that the normal inventory is the quick inventory.\n3. Inventory is a pain in the ass\n\nSo... no tutorial, strange inventories... but also: vendors are really realistic (they dont sell anything useful) or if they do, those things are sold for the price of an eye.\n4. Difficulty is too high to become a good warrior?\n\nHow do spells and magicians work? I mean, I came from D&D and Hack & Slash or even text games, but there's no tutorial and couldnt understand how to activate spells, or to learn them like in Skyrim or Dragon Warrior, it is kind of obvious that there's a limit of each spell level per rest, but the how many spells can I learn and the stats are really confusing (a.k.a.: tradition ... helps you understanding but wont give you extra damage). And if you consider that you will be also doing friendly fire without an option to deactivate that, well... \n5. This time the mage is not as good.\n\nBe careful our there if you get wounded, because this is really realistic, you will only be able to heal / treat your wounds out of combat. Also, you get kind of a tiredness bar in which after each combat, you will be more tired and susceptible to damage or to become fainted so... extra difficulty.\n6. Potions... please use them to heal instantly.\n\nHow do you farm for money? Once you kill something, that thing wont reappear and the area/monsters ratio is too high, leaving so much air, lack of loot and povertiness to deal with. Also, the mobs drop almost nothing and you have to buy all the jewels of the crown to be a decent warrior.\n7. No Money and lots of things you need to buy.\n\nWhat's up with the bard? Can he do something apart from chanting at the start of a combat?\n8. I expected more from the bard.\n\nThese are some CONs and now Im tired of writing, I may try it again when I get bored of other games and curious enough to try this one again.\n\nIn conclusion: I really wanted to love this game. The visuals are really fantastic and the music and lore is really nice, but it has such big  cons in my point of view (not everyone will think these as cons), that I cant recommend it.",

        "review": "Intriguing story, but very vague. The controls are not only complicated, but the user interface is a mess. The first time I attempted Pillars of Eternity, I kept getting slaughtered because it's so non-intuitive. My whole purpose as the player-character was also smothered in question marks, so I frequently wandered around wondering wtf. The settings are pretty, and the characters seem to have a lot of potential, but after 50 hours I finally finished Act 1 - by complete accident. I'm still cursing under my breath whenever there's a fight because it's like an endless sequence of pause-click-pause-click for every member in my party. The data about what is going on is so...textual. Huge amounts of text, and in-dept, disconnected lore. So in all, I'll call this a C- video game (likely two stars, but possibly three). Great ideas, great potential, but way too much confusion and miserable micro-managing of each team member in every fight. Spend your money on a better game.",

        "review": "It's a fun game. Definitely reminiscent of games like Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate 1&2. The mechanics and rules are different but similar, I think neither adding nor subtracting from the game, just requiring familiarization. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and found there are days and days of content, if not weeks and weeks. \r\n\r\nI did not really encounter any bugs that I can think of, I can't think of a time I was stopped from playing and frustrated by an obvious flaw or bug. \r\n\r\nI got enjoyment from both nostalgia for similar games from years, decades ago, and the sense of D&D style adventure and discovery, and the merit of the game itself and it's own storylines and exploration and battles. I REALLY liked that there is some light upgrading, crafting, and your own fortress and home base. That to me added another level that I don't remember from Icewind or Baldur. Having my own castle/home base, with hirelings and different rooms and local merchants, was a nice added touch. IMO that kind of thing added to any game, really gives you a sense of living in the world, like homes in Skyrim, and other games. And it does kind of give you a sense that you are escaping to your own world, with your own home, where you get a satisfaction of comfort and belonging.\r\n\r\nSo I can't really think of any negatives, and can only say I felt this is solid gaming and entertainment, worth the price.",

        "review": "My streak of reviewing games multiple years too late continues - I hope someone finds this useful! This was an absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish. Going to split this into three sections to keep everything organised.\r\n\r\n[h3] What you're getting yourself into [/h3] \r\nPoE I is a very story-focused RPG with a main storyline divided into acts and a sea of side-quests and tasks for you to complete along the way. Its two expansions, White March I and II, are structured the same. Combat is real time with pause. The game lets you choose a variety of classes that impact your dialogue choices and quest choices throughout the story. Dialogue is partially voice-acted (important quests, most companion dialogue, etc.).\r\n\r\n[h3] Positives [/h3] \r\nI absolutely adore this game, every minute of it was delightful. Here are some highlights:\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]  [b] Beautiful visuals [/b]  - Obviously the game didn't come out this year, but in my opinion it still looks gorgeous. The game is isometric, which mostly eliminates the threat of 'bad angles' for its environments. The maps all look wonderful, the models are detailed, and though the characters are of course small and took some getting used to after playing some newer games, all the armors and gear are really well-made in my opinion too. Even with the limitation of angle, the environments have a sense of depth and verticality.\r\n    [*]  [b] Top-tier writing [/b]  - Sometimes, CRPGs kind of overwhelm you with text. I'm used to text-focused games, but there is an upper limit to everything. PoE however is not that kind of game. Its descriptions and dialogues are all to-the-point, and it honestly amazes me how they manage to get each character's unique personality and traits across in such a brief format. \r\n    [*]  [b] Intriguing story [/b]  - I enjoyed the story greatly. There were inevitably a few minor 'filler' tasks to complete here and there, but for the most part, even the side quests had really interesting storylines and outcomes. It isn't often that RPG quests are unpredictable in the direction they take after you've played enough of them, but here it happens fairly consistently, and I love the game for that. I like that there are choices throughout the game that impact the endings you get, too.\r\n    [*]  [b] Extra quest/dialogue options [/b]  - I will never not bring this up as a major plus of this game; your class matters even outside of combat, and lets you resolve quests in unique, otherwise inaccessible ways. It makes your character feel so much more like an actual part of the in-game world, and I appreciate that a lot.\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\n[h3] Negatives [/h3] \r\nI will try to include a quick note for overcoming/mitigating these for anyone wanting to play the game.\r\n[list]\r\n    [*]  [b] Early combat heavily favours strong melee characters [/b]  - My first quest, on which I went with my chanter PC and Aloth, resulted in me getting absolutely destroyed by a handful of ghosts because low level wizards can do very little before needing rest, and chanters aren't any better off. Later on, both of these characters did a complete 180° and became very powerful, but initially I was tempted to give up on them and just focus on fighters and other warrior-type classes. I recommend sticking with your wizard/chanter/cipher, or setting the game to an easier difficulty if you want - I did as well, and there's no shame in it because the game isn't at all easy at times.\r\n    [*]  [b] Combat has a slower pace [/b]  - This I feel is kind of inevitable with RTWP combat setups, and where it's most glaring is probably in the weird limbo your party enters after killing their last current enemy but before exiting combat mode. To mitigate this, I recommend setting the time/pace to normal rather than slow (Key should be 'S'), which will make this transition faster.\r\n[/list] \r\n\r\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game with both of its story DLCs. It was a great experience and definitely worth the nearly 100 hours I spent on it.",

The second is that the special effects are abyssmal when it comes to visibility. In so many complicated fights I just can't see what's going on because there's glowing lights, distortions and fog everywhere.",

Alongside the fact that they'e too fast for a CRPG, the moveset of the party members are so slow that it takes ages to cast a spell and unless you're extremely lucky, you won't die in the process. It feels like it's concepted as a hack 'n' slash but some odd higher-up wanted it to be a RTWP for some reason. \r\n\r\nOther than that, everything else is quite unorthodox about this game from the UI to the leveling system which definitely overcomplicates things. Last but not the least, the presentation is quite poor. The game occasionally throws at you dialogues and narrations that aren't voiced and textwalls made up by funders on Kickstarter which do not make any contributions to the lore in any way.\r\n\r\n1/10",

There was a true craftsman's dedication in this game, from the soundtrack to the artist who supposedly spent a week handcrafting each possible character portrait (they are beautiful).\n\nThanks to this game, cRPGs are back. You should at least play the First Act with the mad lord Raedrick.\n\nFans of Fallout will love it.",

This had escaped me during a non gaming phase and I went to it during the beginning of Covid which was exactly what I needed. I have played this and the sequel twice and will do it eventually again. Obsidian absolutely rocked this one!!!! Reminds me the most of the glory days of Neverwinter Nights.",

However, some of the companions seemed a bit flat and the main character's motivation as thought up by the developers was a bit vague, that's why some of the dialogue options later on might have come up as a surprise. Despite that, all in all, it's a nice game, worth a playthrough",

Some weird design choices here and there, plus it has a few bugs but none of it stopped me from enjoying the game.\n\nI loved BG3 but this game brought me back to my childhood and stands up there with BG2 and the loads of other CRPGs that came before it. A must in any CRPG fan's library.",

There is some good stuff in this game, but ultimately i found that some of design choices stopped me from enjoying it.\r\n\r\nThe Good - the game world is beautifully made with a strong atmosphere. Decent music, sound effects and voice acting all combine to deliver a world you want to explore. The quality of this side of the game compares well with Baldur's Gate titles.\r\n\r\nThe Bad - Sadly the developers made some choices with how the game works that left me wondering why. They range from minor annoyances all the way up to \"i don't want to play this any more.\"\r\n\r\nMinor Annoyance: No damage reduction for helmets - wear nothing, a straw hat or a cast iron helm forged in by Odin himself and it makes no difference to your characters' armour or defence ratings at all. I guess no one ever gets hit in the head in Pillars of Eternity.\r\n\r\nDisappointing: Characters only healed by sleep - Want to add a priest or healer to your party to patch up your warriors after battles? Don't bother, they can't actually do that. The only way to regain hp is to sleep. This not only renders healing characters pretty useless but also slows down the game considerably.\r\n\r\nThe final straw: No XP from fights - The big hook for me in these games is levelling up my crew. This is what drives me to explore every corner of the map, murder anything that moves, disarm all the traps and complete all the quests. I do it all just for that lovely juicy XP that i can make my characters awesome with.\r\n\r\nBut if i'm not getting XP for killing stuff as i explore, then the combat becomes a pointless time sink that i have to endure if i want to see what i might find in that cave or whatever.\r\n\r\nInstead of finding a group of skeletons and thinking \"Great! more XP for me, lets wipe them all out!\" i'm thinking \"Oh more skeletons, how annoying\".\r\n\r\nAnd so i gave up on the game.\r\n\r\nIf the XP for combat issue doesn't bother you then you'll probably enjoy this title - as it does feel well made and with love for the genre. But personally i couldn't get past that and lost interest pretty quick after i become aware of it.",

This review contains minor spoilers, but nothing substantive enough to ruin your enjoyment of the game.\n\nThis game's writing is genuinely impeccable. All of the companions are well written and amazing, including, and especially the DLC companions. You truly need to listen to each of them, and the game gives you opportunities to both challenge their points of views, and learn from them. \n\nDurance in particular is an amazingly well written companion. He is a misogynistic priest that views his own goddess as a wh*re,  and damn does he make you yearn for his dialogue indicator to pop up so you can talk to him more. He is incredibly complex, and challenges your views at every turn throughout the game. \n\nHowever, aside from the excellent companions, Pillars does something extraordinary that I have not encountered since Planescape: Torment.\n\nPillars of Eternity makes you truly think about the questions it poses you. Near the end of the game, you encounter various gods, and must perform a task for each to earn a full conversation with that god. These are some of the best written, and most thought provoking conversations I've ever taken part of in a video game, and these conversations will end up deciding the end of the game. Whatever you think you will decide to do up until you have these conversations, you are likely wrong, and the gods will likely persuade you to do otherwise. I was very unsure the entire time of what ending to pick, until I finally came to a long thought decision, until speaking to all of the gods and completely changing my decision by the end of my discoveries.\n\nIn fact, all the dialogue with the gods in this game is amazing. In almost every conversation I had with the gods, I had multiple minute long moments of pause, attempting to decide on what stance I truly believe in, as they ask you such complex questions to attempt to change your logic and thinking, thus vastly changing the end and outcome of the game. All I can say is that Obsidian once again proves their writing team is the best in the industry.\n\nHowever, one moment shines above all others. This is pretty major spoilers for the DLC, but this DLC does not effect the main story in any way other than adding on to the ending.\n\nSpecifically, in the White March Part II DLC, you speak with a god named Ondra. This is the best conversation in the ENTIRE game. You spend this entire DLC believing this goddess to be a mad, and evil goddess, as who else could drive their followers to commit such atrocities against you, a champion of the people?\n\nAnd in a single conversation she flipped by beliefs upside down. I refuse to say more, because you need to experience this for yourself, truly.\n\nIf you're second guessing buying this game, play it, it's amazing. You will not regret it.",

        "review": "[h1] Has all the strengths and flaws of Western RPGs. Make of that what you will... [/h1]\n\nPillars of Eternity is classic throwback CRPG in the vein of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, Neverwinter Nights and probably a bunch of other 90s computer RPGs I never played but have seen video essays about.\nYou play as a random shlubbo who gets embroiled in a cosmic scheme involving dethroned gods, reincarnation and a whole bunch of extremely setting-specific mystical goings-on.\n\nPoE does not do a whole lot to hold the player's hand and ease them into the setting and gameplay mechanics, jump-scaring you with dense lore and setting details on frame one of the character creation screen. I assume this is somewhat faithful to the classic CRPGs, many of which assumed a degree of preexisting familiarity with their campaign settings. Pillars of Eternity relentlessly bombards the player with Proper Nouns, place names (most of which you never get to see) and random details about the history and lore of the setting, which may or may not be important later on. My problem with the writing is that for all the detail it crams into its script, the setting never felt particularly creative or enthralling to me. The combination of generic cod-Celtic place names, standard-issue Fantasy races, unmemorable costume design and brown-and-green landscapes made it very hard for me to get invested in the setting and story. I'm not going to read your 50-page centuries-spanning Lore Bible if you look and feel just like every other sub-Tolkien EuroWorld, guys...\n\nGameplay is similarly confusing at first. Combat is most similar to Final Fantasy XII; a timer-based real-time system that lets you pause to give specific directions. I never quite grasped what each of the stats do or what the various buffs and debuffs mean. Still, I did manage to muddle my way through to the end before losing interest, so even if you're unfamiliar with this type of game, you'll probably be fine. In the moments when you're dungeoneering, disarming traps, slinging spells and hoovering up loot, it's a lot of fun.\n\nI did eventually lose interest, partially due to my play-style (which involved maximising the amount of loot and story content I got to experience at the cost of actual role-playing; though in my defense, it's hard to roleplay as a highly-intelligent wizard when you have to stop to ask very basic details about the world every other conversation...) and partially due to the limits and frustrations of the genre (Who am I playing as? Why is there all this shit lying around? Why would I do what I'm doing except for XP and loot? Why do I have to spend 90% of the game waiting for my little man to catch up with my mouse cursor?)\nWhile I can't say I loved it, I did value the experience. I'm not a fan of what this is, but for what it does is, it's do it quite good...",

From setting up your character's backstory, their stats, their beliefs, spells & grimoires, to even crafting/upgrading your equipment. There is no shortage of options here, and even better the lore/narrative is just as gripping as the gameplay. This is truly what most RPGs strive to be and yet often fall short of. \r\n\r\nOne of Pillars' greatest strengths is its balance between combat, strategy, and dialogue. You unlock a home base after getting through the early game, and from there on out there exists a fun base management feature, that further lends itself to the narrative at times. You may have strangers visit your base and make requests of you, or you could even imprison people who have wronged you, or perhaps you just collect on property taxes to help get yourself the money needed to buy yourself something special this week. All the while, you'll be exploring the world and attempting to unravel the reason behind the mysterious affliction your player character has been afflicted with.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue choices in this game are often staggering in their quantity & are rarely poor in execution. There are countless well-written characters & exchanges and most of them are heavily influenced by your personal character's decisions, reputation, beliefs, and sometimes even their appearance. Being the gift that keeps on giving, Pillars of Eternity is only the first of two games (a 3rd spin-off is on the way \"Avowed\") in its franchise, and all of your choices directly carry over to the sequel, similar to games like \"The Witcher\" or \"Mass Effect\". \r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of Isometric RPGs then you need to do yourself the favor and play this game, because the sequel only gets better. This is a game that rewards patience and one that is easily replayed time and time again. The only harsh thing I can say about it is that the combat has a somewhat steep learning curve if you are not familiar with this style of game beforehand. Otherwise, this is destined to become a gaming cult-classic if it isn't considered one already.",

Pillars of Eternity is an isometric RPG from the world-wide reputed developers Obsidian, yes, them dudes who will body you in your own saga, and the first installment in the series. It has everything a proper nerd will enjoy: deep, fleshed out lore, political intrigues, complex characters that evolve and voice their own opinions, great soundtrack, fantastic difficulty curve, amazing pacing, great mechanics and a rich, fantastically well designed combat where knowledge and understanding of the game's mechanics are key to succeed. The game is a long, slow-paced journey that will keep you entertained and intrigued from beginning to end, and a very well written story that demands respect and attention from the player in order to grasp a good idea of the whole picture. The DLCs are lovely, very entertaining, quite impressive additions to the already phenomenal main story, which could easily spawn entire books. \n\nIt is a fine example of a no bullshit, no gimmicky, old school purebreed R.P.G., both punishing and rewarding, that will challenge both old cats, like me, and newcomers. I ended a 100% playthrough and started a second character straight away, so it's easy to recommend and a must have. Just buy it.",

The world of Eora, its history and politics, its metaphysics and pantheon, has no equals among computer RPGs. It's mature, deep, complex, just so finely crafted. This game - and its successor too - is a true gem. <3",

        "review": "I played the enhanced editions of Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment over the weeks leading up to my playthrough of Pillars of Eternity. I mention this, because Pillars explicitly tries to emulate those games. And unfortunately it just doesn't hit the mark.\n\nTo start with, I found the writing to be way too indulgent: too many lore dumps, too much descriptive language woven into the conversations, and too much character exposition. All of it is ultimately in service of a fictional world that just does not reach the same quality level as any of those old classics based on DnD campaign settings.\n\nA major gripe I had: a lot of what's happening on a moment-to-moment basis within the writing ends up being really hard to follow due to how it's all set up. To elaborate (without major spoilers), your character is a \"Watcher\", someone who is capable of seeing soul essence, and reading the souls of other living beings. Souls in the world of Eora are recycled, and as a result, you're attuned to the past lives of both yourself and others. Functionally, this serves as a tool that allows the writer(s) to have you constantly jumping into past experiences, exposited in the form of elaborate, flowery text that (for me at least) starts to wear out its welcome really fast. Be ready for pages and pages of frustratingly vague yet colorful language that tends to meander a lot. In a massively missed opportunity you NEVER PLAY THROUGH any of these past experiences via gameplay, it's all just text!\n\nThe villain is a man who cannot be taken seriously: his hat is really f*cking stupid, he isn't intimidating at all. Seriously. His dumb hat makes him look like Rita Repulsa from the Power Rangers.\n\nAt the end of the game there is a big reveal. It sucked.\n\nSo what about combat? In retrospect, the old Infinity Engine games had a style of gameplay that was not particularly challenging if you knew what you were doing. Your knowledge of the game's mechanics (or lack thereof) were primarily what would lead to success or failure. This worked to the betterment of those games: you really felt like you were having a pen-and-paper adventure, where you were only at the mercy of your own understanding (and maybe also the dice rolls). With the right party configuration, spell selection, pre-buff routine, stash of potions, etc, and a little bit of luck, you could be unstoppable. That is less the case in Pillars of Eternity...\n\nPre-buffing is not possible, as you cannot cast defensive spells or use potions prior to combat. Also, you cannot access all of your potions or scrolls after a fight breaks out, but rather the particular item you want to be available has to be loaded into one of your character's quickslots prior to initiating an encounter (most characters will only have four quickslots).\n\nOn top of all this there are tank mechanics that did not exist in any of the old CRPGs. Tanking is primarily centered around the concept of \"engagement\". It works as such: each character will have an \"engagement limit\" that can be increased with specific talents, abilities, and gear. This represents the total number of enemies that hypothetically will be forced to focus down that character at any given time. Most tanks will only be able to get up to around four, maybe five with endgame items. This idea works well enough when there aren't many enemies on your screen, but quickly starts to fall apart during larger encounters, especially as you progress further toward the finale. It was particularly noticeable at the end of The White March 2 DLC, where it is possible to get into large fights which include opponents that can leap or teleport directly to your back line.\n\nThere can also be a ton of micromanaging depending on your playstyle and how your party is configured. Just like Infinity Engine games, it is possible to configure basic AI packages for your party members, but the AI isn't all that good. For example, Wizard characters will constantly run directly into melee range to cast certain touch abilities. Another problem is just how inflexible the AI is concerning a party member's role. Like, I don't think it's possible to set your priest character to automatically swap between healing and damage; you would have to pause and manually adjust the AI setting mid-combat.\n\nYour reward for pushing through the (often tedious) combat segments usually ends up being just more tedious exposition dumps. A design decision that I found to be completely baffling: you do not get XP for kills in this game. Presumably this was to prevent over-leveling, but it doesn't even accomplish that goal, as there are enough sidequests to render the final dregs of the main story trivial unless you allow scaling.\n\nThere are four difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Path of the Damned. I played the game on Hard, and to be honest, I wish I had not. Apparently, on Hard and PotD enemies get completely slathered in a stat called Damage Reduction, or DR. In order to actually deal any substantial damage to your opponent, you need to hit hard enough to overcome their DR. This means that weapons that attack fast but for less damage per hit end up being pretty worthless, whereas slow-hitting, big chunky hits are what you want. So the majority of weapon types end up being basically trash: you want weapons that have innate DR reduction, or crushing damage, or raw damage, and they have to do lots of damage in a single hit. Why not just give enemies more health instead of this DR gimmick? A lot more character setups would be viable. Oh well.\n\nFor the positives: the pre-rendered backgrounds look great (however characters with their lumpy potato faces and weird hairstyles do NOT). The UI was really clean and functional. Uhh... that's about all I liked, to be honest.\n\nIt took me 70 hours to get through the main story, about half the sidequests, and all the DLC content. I ended up missing one of the party companions. Playtime could be reduced substantially by skim reading through all the text. The game crashed on me once.",

        "review": "First off, I'm gonna start with some beginner tips because omg I wish these were explained through the tutorial:\n\n* Press \"tab\" to highlight intractable objects - I spent the first half of the game not knowing about this and OMG was it annoying. I thought \"shift\" would highlight interactable objects initially because this is the key I'm most familiar with using in CRPGs. \n* Set your controls to change the camera movement settings from arrow keys to W, A, S, and D. This helps a lot. \n* Make sure to mess around with the customizable formation tabs. Some formations may cause your characters to get stuck in doorways, which is a hassle to fix, so make sure to set up a \"filing\" formation and switch between formations before entering a doorway. \n* Do not explore a location unless its either a location you'll regularly visit (ex. a tavern or inn which you'll likely need to frequent). Otherwise, you'll waste time. Only explore the location once you receive the quest related to said location. \n* Do not feel bad or ashamed for looking things up. Trust me, I had to look up locations and major NPC locations far more than once. I highly recommend playing story mode first just so you can figure out quest objectives/locations. The game goes by MUCH faster once you know. \n* Storywise, I recommend playing Cipher because Cipher gets a lot of story content. The best way to play Cipher, however, is a major glass canon build, which can be hard for beginners to figure out. Melee Cipher is possible, but arguably less effective. I know storywise, none of the backgrounds and locations of origin have much content in POE1, but archipelgo islands and aristocrat backgrounds have much more content is POE2 if you plan on importing a POE1 save to POE2. \n* Make sure to set up your character properly stat and class-wise because you will not be able to make changes mid-game. Look up a guide if you're unsure of yourself. \n* You can change your party at any tavern. Just look for the party tab. You can change your skills (not stats/class) at any vendor. \n\nI honestly feel like my standards have gotten too high because of BG3. But here are my personal pros and cons. \n\nCons: \n* I wish there was more actual \"roleplaying\" involved. I feel like my character's background was hardly mentioned and the dialogue options struck me as \"super good\", \"stoic/neutral\", or \"super evil\" only. Overall, MC shapes the world around them, but the world around them does not really shape the MC. \n* Sometimes background specific dialogue gets locked or not mentioned because of choices you made far earlier in the game, which is disappointing to see. (ex. I let the noble girl get possessed by the Skaenite slaves in Act 1, as RP wise my character had a slave background and just wanted to see nobles burn, but where Skaen is supposed to mention the MC's slave background to both MC and the party in Act 3, he doesn't and instead remarks how impressive the MC's actions during this event were.) I think it can still be assumed/headcannoned that your party knows about your character's background, but there's no reaction to it. This is the same case with POE2. It'd be cool if party members questioned my evil actions during this event, because most party members are good/neutral characters, and I could then explain my disdain for nobles due to my MC's slave background. Overall, the actual \"roleplay\" aspect of the series is kinda weak. \n* Why do major NPCs look like minor NPCs? More than once, I found it difficult to locate major NPCs because they looked so damn average. Meanwhile, some unimportant NPCs LOOK like they should be major NPCs which pisses me off. \n* There are still some bugs with gameplay. \n* I feel like the companions could've used longer questlines--especially the companions you encounter at the very beginning of the game. I was actually disappointed with how short Eder and Aloth's quests were. The good thing is that most companion quests follow the MC's main questline, so you can travel to wherever you need to go along the way. \n* AI gets confused pretty often. Especially in doorways. It's better to just turn it off and manually control characters for every move, but at the same time it gets hectic, so I avoided doing this unless the battle was a major battle. \n* It's difficult to find certain locations. Many times, I had to look up where to go. Sometimes graphical glitches actually obscured or outright didn't allow me to get to where I needed to go. (Ex. at the final Shadow dungeon (forgot its name) a shadow continued to obscure the stairway I needed to go down to get to Thaos. I had to look up where to go, and I realized this. The stairway only revealed itself after I reloaded the dungeon.)\n* Holy F*** the amount of time I spent staring at loading screens probably made up at least 25% of my playthrough. I feel like one thing Obsidian gets wrong that Larian figured out is that each act should be set in one location with few loading required locations. Otherwise, there is far too much back and forth.\n* At least 50% of the game is walking from location to location. I think pillars of eternity 2 actually fixes this by condensing the maps slightly. \n* Caed Nua restoration is neat, but I feel like it was underwhelming with the lack of content. I was hoping to see storylines/quests unlock as a result of fixing parts of Caed Nua. (Maybe I missed these? Idk) \n* You, unfortunately, can't change your stats/build/class mid-game. You can only change your skills. \n\nPros: \n* Matt Mercer's voice. No, I totally did not just side with the evil Skaenite Wymgourd because he was also voiced by Matt Mercer. \n* Gameplay is fun once you figure it out. I honestly restarted my game 3 times to figure it out. \n* A lot of world building. Arguably, sometimes too much. I did forget major names/titles/events very often as I explored. \n* A lot of gameplay build options\n* A lot of reading for reading lovers such as myself. \n* Replayability. There are a lot of builds to mess around with, and there are different choices you can make to impact the ending. \n* Although there is a limited number of choices, they do still impact the storyline. I'm just disappointed they're not as prominent once imported to POE2. \n* Most of the companions are interesting and likeable. My favorite was Eder not just because of his voice, his role in POE2 and his close relationship with the MC, but because he was a major meatshield for my glass cannon Cipher build lol. Eder is a total bro (sadly just a bro). I think you'll like him even more in POE2. \n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable, but I think I'll be focusing more on POE2 because I think it fixes a lot of issues of POE1. Again, I still feel like Obsidian doesn't understand the most optimal CRPG formula like Larian does because both POE1/2 can get really frustrating at times. Sometimes, I was so frustrated I considered quitting, but i'm glad I made it all the way through. I think POE1 is a one and done game for me though. \n",

The game has much more mature vibes then majority of the other CRPGs in the genre and the game isn't afraid to take itself seriously and not undermine it's dramatic moments with forced humor. Something I wish more games had the courage to do.\n\nThe cast of companions are rich in moving, personal backgrounds, story-lines and fulfilling character arcs. Several of the companions in this game are some of my all-time favorite companions of the entire CRPG genre. Aside from narrative, world-building & lore is an extremely fleshed out, strong positive of the PoE games as well.\n\nThe maps & level design are beautifully done & the music is top notch.\n\nCombat utilizes the older, classic Real-Time w/ Pause. A system that allows for a tremendous amount of depth & complexity and battlefield awareness. HOWEVER, it is definitely a system where you either like it or you don't. So keep this in mind before purchasing. It is NOT optional like it is in PoE2.\n\nIt's one of the greats in the genre for sure.",

It has the charme and the aesthetics of an old school CRPG but combined with lots of modern quality of life in terms of gameplay. But most importantly: The story this game tells is AMAZING if you are looking for something that brings up rather big philosophical questions and discourses. Enlightenment, mythology/religion vs. technology, racism, problems of progress, constructivism. And all that in a story that is embeedded in a rather classical fantasy world. This is important to me because I am not so much into the weird/absurd stories (e.g. Planescape Torment) where the whole world is so far away from yours that it's sometimes not as immersive. This is not the problem here – you will often think about what happens in the world of Pillars of Eternity, and you will almost always find analogies to your own world.\n\nIn short: I truly think that most of the games that are considered \"incredibly well written\" are not even close compared to mediocre literature (or films). In my opinion there is one example of a computer game that is as well written as good literature – and that game is Disco Elysisum. BUT the story of Pillars of Eternity is on the second place to me.\n\nPlay this – AND DO NOT READ THE DIALOGUE OF THE GOLDEN NAME PLATE NPCs. Those are texts written by Crowdfunding backers that are (sorry) mostly very boring, and will kill your joy of reading this game.",

        "review": "[b]Pillars of Eternity[/b] is credited with revitalising the CRPG genre. I believe this praise is justified.\n\n[b]PoE1[/b] is a solid CRPG built around the classical formula of [i]Infinity[/i] games from the past with some quality-of-life improvements that make it more accessible to the modern audience.\n\nWhat I liked the most was the grim atmosphere, the tragic well-written stories, and that it's NOT using the DnD mechanics. Albeit the combat and classes are mostly the same as in DnD, all stats are relevant for each class, the min-maxing is not as crucial as in [i]Infinity[/i] games, and the action outcomes are not decided by random dice throws (there is some probability involved, but to a lesser extent than in DnD).\n\nIf you take the time for reading the stat and ability descriptions, the game's cyclopedia, and the combat log, you start to realise how everything comes together. For example, you can choose between high armour rating with slow execution time or low armour rating with fast execution time; strong, but slow weapons or fast, but weak weapons; high accuracy (one-handed weapons) at the expense of attack frequency (dual-wielding), strong defence (shields) at the expense of accuracy (one-handed) or high attack frequency (dual-wielding) at the expense of accuracy (one-handed). \n\nBut the great thing is that all those choices work, if only you stay consistent and build upon them. The game is very flexible in this regard.\n\nDifferent weapons and different spells provide different types of damage, different armours have different resistances and different enemies require a different approach. That's why you have to study the bestiary before each encounter, plan which weapons, spells, and items to use and how to position your party ahead of the combat. Since the combat is real-time with pause, the positioning is somewhat problematic, but it is still possible to use narrow passages, traps and flanking to your advantage. Everything can be bypassed and countered in this game, and that's what made the combat so enjoyable for me.\n\nAlthough, I do have to admit that this level of micromanaging is not for everyone. Less patient people probably should just play on the normal difficulty. I grew tired of it by the end of the game myself. On the other hand, after progressing beyond level 8, most of the encounters become a cakewalk anyway. Only some of the high-level areas (in White March and Caed Nua) and bosses (like dragons) are somewhat challenging, unfortunately, mostly because of buffed-up damage resistances and health.\n\nI also have to add, that in the typical [i]Obsidian[/i] fashion, wizards and area attacks get the preferential treatment, even to the point that some of the scripted text adventures (there is such a thing in the game) require a wizard for the best outcome.\n\nI also was not happy with the following. You can't dual-wield pistols and blunderbusses (like in [b]PoE2[/b]). Weapon focuses don't increase the damage, but only the accuracy (by mediocre 6 points). Weapon focuses don't synergise with weapon styles well enough — each focus includes at least one two-handed, at least one one-handed and at least one ranged weapon, whereas the styles are: the one-handed style, the two-handed style, the two-weapon style, and the weapon-and-shield style; there also some passive talents for ranged weapons. With the two White March expansions the level cap is 16, which restricts the flexibility of your builds quite a bit. Consequently, some of the passive talents are not worth the cost. I guess this was done because the players get too powerful by the middle of the game. Likewise, the traps were nerfed and the talents that improve the traps and potions were dropped from the final game version.\n\nFortunately, all of these minor problems might be adjusted with the IE Mod to your heart's content.\n\nAs to the other major aspect of the game, the story, I can say that it's solid. It's nothing mind-blowing, but it's solid. It's a story that takes itself seriously. The game takes place in post-war Dyrwood, where children are being born without souls, wizards are experimenting on prisoners and lunatics, bandits are roaming the countryside, tyrants are oppressing the population, and various factions are competing for power. The quests are well written, intricate, and usually offer more than one way of solving them. If you pay attention to the details, you realise that more often than not they are also tragic. Sometimes, solving a quest requires choosing between a bad outcome and a worse outcome. But which is which — that is for you to decide — since morality in this game is rarely black and white. It's exactly this aspect that made me enjoy this game so much.\n\nI only wish that the companions were more likeable. I didn't develop a sense of attachment to any of them. Only after completing the companion quests, did I learn to appreciate them more. I have used the word \"tragic\" a lot in this review, but their stories are precisely that — a tragedy. All of them have suffered some kind of injustice, personal loss, or a deeply traumatic event at some points in their lives. So, your job as a watcher (a soul-reader) is to help them to overcome the trauma in one way or another. \nOr not. You can also play solo (the game does not favour that, especially, on the hardest difficulties, but it’s doable) or hire custom-made companions (with potentially better stats). Or you can use the canon companions and modify their stats and even classes with the IE mod.\n\nBefore concluding my review, a few words about the economy, graphics, and the soundtrack.\n\nThe economy is somewhat problematic. Everything is expensive, and fully upgrading your keep and items takes considerable effort and time. Perhaps, this was done to make stealing more viable, I don't know. Either way, you won't be swimming in money until the final chapter or until you have completed the White March expansions, which not only offer you the best unique items in the game, but also the most amount of loot to sell. Doing White March is not recommended until about level 10, so it's kind of late game anyway.\n\nAs to the graphics, well, what's not to like about pre-rendered 2D backgrounds? They look good even in the [i]Infinity[/i] games, even more so in a modern game on a high resolution. It's hard to pick up the details on the 3D models, though, but you can adjust the zoom level with IE mod and a console command.\n\nThe soundtrack fits the atmosphere, although I'd say that it's somewhat generic most of the time — you know, your classic epic fantasy stuff you hear in Hollywood films and similar RPGs.\n\nSo, in total, I'd rate this game with [u][b]8/10[/b][/u]. It's a solid CRPG with a good combat system and a great story. It doesn't reach for the stars, but “solid” is good enough for me. [b]PoE[/b] tried to deliver the best of the old [i]Infinity[/i] games to the modern audience, and I think it has succeeded in this task. With its relatively low budget, it's a praiseworthy achievement.",

If the answer was the story, the character's, and/or the world, this game is for you. If you just thought it was pretty and liked the combat, POE may put you off but it's worth a shot.\n\nPOE1 does have some minor issues that are a necessary evil for any crowd funded game. Some of the writing for the memories you can listen to was done by random backers. That means the writing for these can have varying levels of quality and... edginess.\n\nThe important stuff:\n\nThere's a lot of discourse over POE1 or POE2 being better. I'm of the opinion that it is entirely based on opinion. Do you like a dark mysterious forest with a mysterious castle to restore? If so, you'll like POE1. Do you like a sunny archipelago full of piracy and imperialism, with a ship for you to restore.? If that's the case, you'll probably prefer POE2. If you like both, play the games in order and get an even better overall experience.\n\nBoth games are, very generally, about solving a problem surrounding the gods of the world. POE1 and 2 are fantastic, so if you have to choose it really is about which setting you prefer.",

I usually adore terrible combat (Fallout: New Vegas, despite being known for terrible combat, has some of my favourite PvE content in any game) but here it is just soooo sloppy. Even in old Infinity Engine titles I enjoyed this kind of real time CRPG stuff just fine - here, I think there's just way too much of it.\r\n\r\n- The story is okay. When I've heard people talk about this game, they've said it's really complicated. It's not, it's just verbose. You know how Fallout 1&2 have really succinct writing? Imagine the exact opposite of that, and the world building and story is also less inspired.\r\n\r\n- The backer NPCs suck. The fact that you search \"remove POE backer NPC mod\" and all you can find is forums of people roasting the OP for asking them to be removed is just lame. Seriously, they are immersion breaking, Tumblrcore original character type bullshit in an otherwise very stoic, solemn game. I don't want someones cool gang of tricoloured vivisectors standing around under the tree hung with muddy, roped corpses (no hate to Tumblr. I love Tumblr, that was just my way of articulating my ANGER).\r\n\r\nThere are other negatives. The stronghold is underdeveloped. The world feels dead (but not in the way it should - it feels too static). I'm getting tired of writing about it though.\r\n\r\nI think Obsidian just needed to make a more focused experience. Make the game a little less linear, replace some of the combat/lore dumping with characters/quests that make the world that feel more alive. Wish I'd chosen a better game to play while procrastinating my uni work",

It hits you like a brick at first and gives you nothing to keep you going, a bland yet enormous wall of lore and a combat system in which you can't do anything really for the first few levels...except be pummeled by enemies even on \"Easy\". \n\nI tried a Chanter because it felt like a fun and unique class, but all I got was a weakling that automatically started chanting and had no other combat options or skills. There's just nothing to do but to let combat play itself. Then I got a mage companion...and no matter how I altered his grimoir, his spells kept dazing me. Ok then, I'll let him go first, daze the enemy and then I'll join...oh, wait, my companion is dead after two attacks. Fun. Maybe it gets better in higher levels or with different classes, I don't care: if the first few hours of a game are this boring I just run for a refund.",

        "review": "An heir to the original Baldur's Gate games. If you're looking for an original, mature fantasy setting to dive into, you can't go wrong here. \n\nWhat I loved:\n- Compelling main plot that isn't afraid to take its time building up to its conclusion. \n- The writers did a great job unpacking the central themes of the game (fate vs autonomy, how to find meaning in a chaotic world, the burdens of knowledge, the value of faith, and honestly so much more). One of the best things about the CRPG genre is that the good ones really make you think, and Pillars does that very well IMO.\n- A suitably cunning but also morally grey antagonist. I never felt the writers were pushing me to come to one ethical conclusion.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- I enjoyed the visuals. Obviously they aren't cutting edge but the intentional throwback aesthetic does a lot to make everything still look decent in 2024.\n- The gameplay is fun, I appreciate the existence of RTWP systems in a turn-based world. \n- Character building is good, although I think it becomes a little saturated by the time you reach max level in certain classes. I appreciate that Obsidian brought in some original classes for their universe.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- Sound mixing was a little bit whacky at times. It's clear they used a totally different set up in recording the White March dialogue, and the mixing is jarring when new companions from that DLC speak right after an NPC from the base game.\n- I really liked some companions (Eder and Aloth are my dudes!). But it is very clear who the 'core companions' are - better sidequests, their storylines are baked into the main plot, etc. The others feel like they only exist for the sake of representing their class in the party roster.\n- Obsidian really drop you in at the deep end in this brand new universe/system. On the one hand, that's awesome - things aren't spoon-fed to you in massive lore dumps right from the get-go. But it can make things extremely confusing at times, while you find your footing in the world and try to figure out the skills/abilities/etc. systems. Would recommend reading a guide on builds, though it's easy to re-spec if you need to.\n\nOverall, awesome game. Looking forward to jumping into the sequel when I press 'post review'.",

The game is great, with awesome story telling. Combat can be pretty hard imo, but you just gotta micro manage your party more. If you enjoy the BG3, I think you'll enjoy this game too. Doesn't have the polish like BG3 but its still a great game. Oh and be ready to read a novel with an insane amount of detail.  8/10",

        "review": "Pretty decent isometric party RPG with real time combat. It's not ideal and has enough flaws for them to be noticeable, but it's still quite good overall. \n\nThe graphics are OK. As usual with the majority of the genre, nothing groundbreaking but good enough and some of the effects are very nice. \nI did not find the visual direction particularly interesting though. It was all drab, dull, grey, etc. Perhaps it was the intention but I did not enjoy it anyway. \n\nThe sound design is OK as well. Again, nothing outstanding but gets the job done. One issue is that some of the dialogues are voiced and some aren't. So, you can go from a voiced sentence to a non-voiced one in one dialogue. It's a bit jarring since it kinda breaks the flow. It would've been better if at least the main dialogues were voiced in their entirety but it's not the case.  \n\nThe gameplay is enjoyable and quite interesting. I played on Hard and never felt as if things were too out of control or difficult, with the later stages of the game actually being the easiest. There is an option to make them artificially harder, though, which I intentionally did not take. \nI played as a Wizard and the class fantasy was pretty much fulfilled. I could deal damage with huge fireballs or ice balls, though not as much DPS as a fighter character, I could control the battlefield with CC, I could debuff and charm the enemies (which on Hard was totally OP since it's like a 5-10 second CC with a chance to make an enemy your ally). \n\nRoleplaying element was good. Not as good as, say, Disco Elysium, which had TONS of branching and flavour, but still good with various choices and consequences, both short term and long term. There were also some quite messed up and grim quests, which I suppose goes along with the whole aesthetic and tone of the game. Even though I did not enjoy grim visuals, I did enjoy those quests. \nThe journal of the MC also contained a hell lot of details and was an interesting and helpful read. \n\nThe overall story was passable. I felt it had a bit too much info and lore and was spread too thin as a result. I had a lot of info about different events in the past and present, but I did not feel very connected to them. I found a more personal story, such as GoW I recently played, more compelling and emotional. PoE's story did not impress me very much, it was simply not that terrible. \n\nNow, there are some flaws which were not crucial but still noticeable:\n1. The entire rest system: for instance, wizards have X spells per rest. However, you can almost always (or even always) go out of the dungeon and rest for free, which means there is practically no limit and you can use all your spells every encounter if you want. What it means is that the limitation is purely artificial and there isn't really any resource management, it's just the question of \"do I want to see 3 loading screens to replenish my spells or should I go further\". \n\n2. No way to bulk sell items or filter them, which means tons of loot you get from low level mobs must be sold manually.\n\n3. A bit too many meaningless easy fights. They do not pose any danger, they do not serve the narrative, they just exist and waste your time. In some of them I did not even press any skills and just mouse clicked the enemies to death. \n\n4. The entire stronghold management is very basic and primitive. Narratively, it was nice to have it to signify main character's influence, but from gameplay standpoint it was pretty lacklustre and felt like an afterthought. \n\nOverall, it's an OK game. I would say it's better than \"mediocre\" or \"average\", but it doesn't reach the heights of \"great\" for me. The story did not capture my interest and the lore was a bit too much. Nonetheless, there were enjoyable elements and at its worst the game was boring sometimes, but never truly bad, awful or anything like that. If you like CRPGs, chances are you might enjoy this one.",

I was put off at first because the graphics do look aged, outside of that, this game plays amazingly and I love the flow of combat and exploration. This is the first real-time combat CRPG I have ever played and I wasn’t sure if I would enjoy it, after beating this game I wish more CRPGs utilized it. On top of that, the graphics did eventually grow on me, certain parts of this game look fucking sick. The story in this game is intentionally confusing at first but as you explore the world and start putting the pieces together this quickly turns into one of the best stories in a CRPG I have ever seen, This game MASTERED world-building. The companion characters in this game are next level too, each one has their story, playstyle, and contribution to the overarching story. This game combines all of my favorite elements from the classic Fallout games and the Wasteland series and puts its own fantasy twist on it.",

        "review": "I got to Act II back in 2016 on GOG, then for some ungodly reason, stopped playing. Now that I'm back in Act II and actually paying attention, I can say this game is incredible. For a kickstarter game that was Obsidian's last-ditch effort to stay afloat, this game is a miracle. The sidequests are all full of depth and actual important choices, the characters feel real and nuanced. The world building and lore is genuinely interesting and rich, the metaphysics of the world are all carefully built, you feel like you are actually a part of a living breathing world, the gradual building of plot points constantly keeps you on your toes begging for more. \nBasically imagine a really good DnD campaign as a video game. It feels right at home with Infinity Engine classics, it has the personal quest that's as deep as BG1, the grand epic storytelling a la BG2, the dungeon diving and hack n' slash goodness of the Icewind Dale games, and the philosophical and moral quandaries reminiscent of Planescape: Torment. The thing is, it doesn't feel derivative of those games, it stands as much on its own while still paying homage and definitely owing a lot of its identity to them. It's a lot of game but most everything is actually good.\nThe biggest criticisms I can think of are the rules of the game, it's a brand new system that while it's definitely inspired by and plays similar to DnD, it is its own thing that is very complex and the game doesn't do a great job of explaining things to you besides in popups and menus. The world building as well is very tough to get into, characters will state things that make no sense to the players and it's up to us to infer what they mean by their statements. There are lore docs throughout the world but that amounts to large blocks of text that explain the histories of the various places you discover and the deities and powers at play in the grand stage of the narrative. Unless you read those massive text blocks, you are going to have to play catch up with your party members and NPCs you talk to to try and have a basic idea of what is going on in this game. Once the lore starts making sense, it's fantastic, but it takes a long time of confusion and reading between the lines to get to the point where it even makes a tiny bit of sense.\nScore from partway through Act II: 8.5/10",

The way it handles the divines and their relationship to the world is done sooooo well it can't be overstated.",

I really want to finish it, and see things through, but...yeah, either I'm bored by the autopilot of the system when encountering low level/generic mobs OR I'm taxed and overwhelmed by the chaos of large group battles and boss fights. This is no fault of the game at all, this is just what the system is. Hence the thumbs up even though I did not like it. \n\nSo if you're looking for some beautiful game with good storytelling, and can tolerate or even enjoy rtwp, then this is a nice one. I've read the sequel implemented a turn based system so Ill probably check that one out.[/strike]\n\nI'm a big baby who doesn't like reading even a single guide or tooltip and jumps straight into normal/hard mode instead of taking the time to learn a wholly new system lmao. That I got to Defiance Bay while struggling before writing this review is comical. \n\nAnyway this game slaps its amazing, I just had to learn how to actually play it. RTWP is fine now. Everything positive I said above still stands.",

        "review": "This was my 3rd attempt to play through this game (tried twice on PS4), and again I quit. It's just not a very well executed game, despite it containing some great elements and ideas. I'll be honest, the game just bores me. . \n\nFrom a combat point of view you fight very similar trash mobs over and over, most of which are dispatched using the same routine every battle. There's an off balance to abilities as, rather than taking the Dragon Age: Origins approach of giving the player freedom to use everything at their disposal each fight, PoE gives you a mix of rest abilities and encounter abilities. In theory it should work, but in practice it just means you use your Encounter abilities first, and by that point the fight is usually over, thus resulting in very predictable fights. \n\nAnd the story is a bit of a mess. It's got a lot of the right ingredients, the hooks are certainly there, but unearthing them is a very arduous task. Pillars also suffers from being one of those games which thrusts you into another world as if you're already familiar with it. You will constantly get dialogue and text which speaks to you as if you are already familiar with the game's areas, factions, and such forth. Piecing all these things together as you go, rather than being drip fed them at a considered pace, makes things feel disjointed.\n\nThe exploration areas are a bit empty, timed events such as those plentiful in Baldurs Gate are far too rare, the quests are pretty bland, Cipher is pretty much the only way to play the game lol...oh and I've not even mentioned the completely immersion-breaking and filler-esq \"Soul Watching\" which you can undertake etc. Honestly, it's just a flat game, not to mention incredibly predictable with it's structure too, which contributes towards the game's general bad pacing. \n\nThere are a lot of good ideas in there for sure though, so it has my respect, but I'm not gonna go into them because ultimately they count for little sadly. If you can stand ploddy, predictably games there is a story in here which is quite good if you can be bothered to piece it together and can endure all the bad stuff, but it wasn't enough to keep me hooked.",

        "review": "Pillar of Eternity is a highly acclaimed game but I have no idea why. I had many problems with the game and I had to force myself to finish the game or explore the world, since it was pretty boring for me. In addition to that, game feels like an old game more than an old-school game. Let me explain that a bit more:\nGameplay elements seems a bit obsolete and not implemented well enough. One of the most obvious ones would be the height attack, for some reason my men wasn’t able to do height attacks but enemy were able to attack from above without any problems. Other than that, there are lots of enemies clumped together and combat is pretty dull with the requirement of micromanagement. Since there are lots of encounters and some of the enemies are much stronger than the other ones, while having no indications, you have to do it by trial and error with a lot of backtracking. However, worst part is the enemies’ unlimited spells. I died a lot of time, because of AoE chain ccs. Sadly, even though there are a lot of spells and classes, spells do not feel very different or for some parts useful. Since there is a spell limit per rest for some reason, the combat feels much worse and more like a chore. Plus, the loot from combat is abysmal, experience is minimal. So, there is no real reason to fight. There are some boss fights with dragons for some reason. Even with their huge stats, they have mobs around for you to fight with the dragon and the mob at the same time. Guess what you get, after killing them… Just a couple useless items. Another problem would be the money. I had lots of money at my playthrough, since there was nothing worth buying other than the free DLC content. Weirdly, most of the binded weapons are mediocre. I think they were added to the game and you have to achieve some things to strengthen your weapon but a lot of them are not worth it. Therefore, realising this, after putting some time into it is annoying. Another weird decision is the enchanting system. There is no disenchantment option or getting back the rare ingredients. If this was a 20 years old game, it would not be problem but it is a problem for a modern game. Caed Nua would be another point for being obsolete. Although, Caed Nua management is an interesting system at his core, it feels like it is half-done, especially with the constant bandit raids. It is very tiny and almost have no real impact. Putting the unbalanced difficulty (with weird spikes) with a lot of RNG and no rewards to the mixture makes the gameplay even worse. Lastly, some quests are not explained after development or not updated properly and you get confused, especially if you are playing it time to time.\nSecond most important thing would be the bugs. If you pick two people from the party and try to move them, they cannot go to the place you have clicked for some reason and it seems like they did not care about it at all. Other problems I have encountered are broken interfaces, characters that go invisible (enemies can see them though), until the end of the combat; bugged books that vanishes (I was making a library and tracking the books that I read), bugged audio, weird book font which can change into another font at the same book. Unfortunately, I did encounter all of these bugs during my playthrough over and over again. \nThe third and last thing that I did not like about the game was the writing-story. First of all, contributor stories are the one of the most idiotic elements I have ever seen. There are lots of them, they do not add anything to the story, break the atmosphere by pushing you afar and it is poorly written, while being too short to be interesting and too long to be curious. Apart from that, there are lots to read about the world and the lore; the main idea of reading souls is interesting. However, writing (like an amateur writer from Wattpad), pace, some of the events not being believable, while being contradicting to some other events (no one cares about the things that happened, characters do not care about anything around them other than stealing), weird and pretentious vocabulary decisions, bland and forced narrative style with boring, ever-talking characters that you do not care (also you start to not care about the story very quickly) with the choices that has no real impact on game are making this game a chore. Also, there are a lot of skills and choices at the beginning which overwhelms the player. DLCs make the game a bit better but definitely it is not enough.",

I don't care what happens from here.]\n\nThe writing just in the first hour of the game is so fucking atrocious and tone-deaf, I don't think I'm prepared to suffer any more of it. \n\nBeginning of the game:\n1. you're sick enough to cause your caravan to stop, causing an accident that requires them to camp for the night\n2. but go get your own remedy by adventuring out in the woods. Did I mention you're meant to be sick?\n3. The guy who was meant to bring back water for your tea has gone missing\n4. of course he was ambushed and killed, along with the rest of the camp\n5. so you, being sick, scale a cliff, only to barely enter ruins at the top of the cliff, just in time for the entrance to said ruins to be destroyed by a sudden storm???\n6. So your party members from the caravan die while you happen upon some sacrificial ritual???\n7. You decide to go to the town your caravan was bound for\n8. YOU SHOW UP TO A TOWN WITH DOZENS OF BODIES HUNG FROM A TREE IN THE SQUARE!?!?!?!?\n9. Some guy threatens you, tells you to watch what you do or you'll end up in the tree\n10. First moment of actual adventuring, some elf is picking a fight with 3 people from the town, 10 feet away from the guy who was threatening you just now, and despite trying to stay out of it, I wind up killing 3 guys??? And nobody cares??? When I was just threatened that I'd en up in the tree???\n\nSo then instead of escaping, or hiding, or any distress, the elf just casually says \"I feel like introductions are in order after that scuffle.\" Like, dude, 3 guys are dead, and these people hate outsiders, let's, idfk, go hide or something? fml...\n\n11. So then I find a TEMPLE RUINS UNDER THE TOWN SQUARE!??!?! Is this a settlement...??? This was supposed to be a town looking for settlers to homestead, and there's just a whole ass ruins under here!?!??!\n\nSo I go into the ruins, and there's this guy, bleeding out, sleeve drenched in blood it says, and he just starts lecturing me about the history of the realm. He's clearly got nothing but time while he's bleeding out. I have to tell him \"cut to the chase\" because clearly the setting and his condition calls for urgency, and he says \"well, if you insist...\"???? So this guy is dying, and he is telling me \"can you go take care of this quest for me, there is gold in it for you.\" OH yeah? who's to say you don't die before I get back? \n\nIn conclusion:\nI don't know how much more fucking whiplash I can take, but this writing is ridiculous. It isn't as if that isn't telegraphed by THE VERY FIRST DIALOGUE IN THE GAME\" when you've got some flat, accentless, city-slicking hillbilly contradaction, where the voice actor is meant to be slurring and drawling his speech, with missing words and hillbilly shorthand, but just falls flat and poorly delivered.\n\nI'm strapped in dire circumstances, with a bloodthirsty town that hates outsiders just kills 3 of their own folk, and nobody cares or notices? \n\nWho wrote this. \n\nIt's terrible. \n\nAnd this is just the first hour.",

I can say that this game is amazing, I made it to act 2 and I now have this massive city to explore, along with a big host of companions. Not all are beyond amazing but most of them really do add to the whole experience. I highly recommend this game to people who are new or are getting into CRPG's again, do not skip this one and go into the seconded you will miss out on so much world building and this amazing story.",

        "review": "As a fan of the older Baldur's Gate games but also as someone who does have kind of a potato for a computer and as such, I'm not able to play Baldur's Gate 3 myself, I started doing research about similar kind of games that are old enough for my computer to be able to handle. I found many recommendations, but what really stood out to me was the Pillars of Eternity-series because of it's own different kind of lore and worldbuilding. I found it really interesting and different yet similar to the older CRPG-games that I used to play when younger. So I bought it and all the DLCs and got to playing... and soon I was 10 hours in and completely hooked. \n\nThere is quite a lot of reading which might not be for everyone, yes, and there are things that could have been done better or differently, but the characters, the story, the combat style (I do enjoy real time with pause more than turn based, personally) and how much there is to see and explore, the many different ways you can go about handling the different quests... it all makes this game worth playing, and playing again - and even again.\n\nI am now on my second playthrough and this time I'm noticing even more things, things that I never noticed during when I played the game for the first time, and I am already planning on my third playthrough to be honest, because this game just gives you so many options to properly roleplay in different ways and to try all the things. And especially at the price you can get this whole game with all the extra content nowadays, I would say this is a must play for all CRPG-lovers.\n\n",

Absolutely recommend it, there is something really unique and particular about this game, especially the theme and universe, with many grey morale choices.\n\nIt's not like Baldur's Gate 3, the mechanics and overall gameplay is probably more polished, as the cinematics, in this recent modern game. But (it's subjective) Pillars of Eternity is more engaging, if you like a good dark fantasy scenario and ambiance.\n\nI also really like the RTWP gameplay, and I strongly recommend to stick with it, as the turn based mode is more of a hotfix if you really can't stand RTWP.\n\nThe sequel is better in all aspects, but don't skip the first if you really want to understand what Eora has to offer, it is still totally worth it and runs really well on modern hardware (and Linux, with proton for the cloud saves synced with Windows).",

        "review": "I bought this game shortly after ti came out, the first time it ever went on sale. It was the first CRPG I had ever played if you don't count Dragon Age, and still is. My first playthrough was terrible and I quit after five hours because I had no idea what I was doing and I was getting destroyed. Fast Forward and I got on the hype train for BG3 but couldn't afford a $60 game so I figured I would tried PoE again. I was in a weird situation irl and ended up theorycrafting for two weeks straight. Probably twenty hours. I was all over the wiki and made a big excel file. Haven't never played DnD before I had a blast just learning classes and skills and mechanics. \n\nAs far as the game itself goes, it was great the second time around. With my immense theorycrafting the game was no where near as hard as it was previously. There were still certain times I got stopped, often against the dryad mage things, but I could usually get them in a few tries. Act 1 is decent though takes time unlocking new areas and you typicaly feel underpowered. Act 2 is the meat of the game. The story gets really good, you have access to most of the map, you've done a little city building lite, you've recruited most characters, and difficulty is perfect (maybe a tad easy since I theorycrafted so much). Third act is where things started falling apart a bit. I hit max level much earlier in the story than I expected and it trivialized the rest of the game. I had read once that most DnD GMs don't like campaigns get past level 12 and I can see why. If you have a team of lvl 15s you just 1-2 shot all enemies, you have so many free spells you never run out of magic, and because of those two things battles get repetitive. The game is also a bit long winded (coming from an JRPG enjoyer) so you're not going to get to the last town until 60+ hours in. And it is a hub town do they litter you with side quests and new NPCs which is all pointless because you are already max level with really good equipment. I haven't actually finished the game yet because I started the DLC before going to the final dungeon and then the holidays happened then other games have happened, so ~85 hours is roughly what you can expect if you do all side quests and NO DLC. Again, if you are max level at start of DLC it is super boring because you just blast through everything\n\nOverall though, I love Pillars and am excited to play the second one which has even deeper systems (which yes, I have already theorycrafted). The story is better than I was expecting, especially Act 2. Bonus that I can play without a hitch on my crappy work laptop",

The game basically told me, \"You shall NOT pass!\" Googling how others got past it didn't help. I'm not going to relive the same boss fight 14 million times until I trip over the one instance I'm able to kill Thanos (I don't have Dr. Strange to give me shortcuts). If you don't mind grinds like that, then give it a try. I uninstalled it. I'll give PoE II a whirl - hopefully it fares better.",

I have laughed, cried, and ran back to this game more than any other. Characters are great and writing is superb. Real time combat might be confusing at first, but its inspired by the old baldur's gate games. idk how many times i can say I love this game to many many pieces",

I discovered it while watching old episodes of Critical Role where Matt and the chat reference it alot, so I decided to see what they were talking about, and man am I glad I did. Having played BG3 for hundreds of hours I was sure this 9 year old game was not gonna hold up with the advances that have been made in CRPG's, but boy was I wrong. This is as fun as any RPG I have ever played and I absolutely love the real time pause combat. I feel like I have found a hidden treasure and I am looking forward to pouring hundreds of hours into this franchise. How did I miss out on this for so long?!?",

        "review": "I find this to be an extremely overrated game. It appears the period in which it was produced had a longing amongst the gaming community for a classic old-skool RPG. Unfortunately, that longing also meant that everything that every game fulfilling those criteras would be applauded as a great game regardless if it was worth playing or not. I agree that Obsidian Entertainment made some great RPG's in the past, but that doesn't mean everything they make is a good game.\n\nThe only reason I played through this game is to get a better start with my character in PoE II: Deadfire. Which, so far, is a much better game than this one.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game are the huge volumes of text everywhere. And it's something you gotta read and learn because towards the end of the game, you're faced with a quiz and have to answer everything correctly in order to proceed.\n\nMy second biggest gripe is that almost all characters are bland and uninteresting. It feels like a choir having to have conversation with them and, once again, read through an entire volume of text, yawning through the entire thing.\n\nI'd much recommend Obsidian's masterpiece Tyranny instead. That game is shorter but far more enjoyable than PoE.",

        "review": "After playing this game and finding it too easy after learning the mechanics I switched to POTD mode and man this game kicked my butt at times (Sky dragon and Ondra's monk swarm). My party consisted of PC ranged cipher, Aloth, Eder, Durance, Kana and Hiravias. I would not recommend playing with mercs as the companions are very interesting. Most of the hours I have from this game are from exploring way too much, doing more side quests than I should have and immersing myself in it's lore. \n\nThis game has unique concepts and gets all philosophical on you. My favorite part of the game had to be uncovering the secrets of the gods and talking to the gods who have such a huge influence on the game's world. The pacing is good unless you factor in white march DLC which brings me to my next point..\n\nI have some gripes with the DLC. I had wished that I did the white march sooner since it's pacing was immersion breaking. I find that the white march DLC at least in part 1 felt like a side quest because the reason I should have been there was already known by me because I basically finished act 3. My advice is to start the DLC when you just start act 2 and finish the DLC once you hit act 3. Cragholdt should be completed after white march part one. White march part two is cool regardless when you do it but I felt that part one was just plain redundant and I didn't enjoy it at all.\n\n",

        "review": "After BG3 I returned to BG1 Enhanced Edition, which had unfortunately aged to a point where I could no longer enjoy its rudimentary combat and dated graphics.  \n\nI turned to Pillars of Eternity, a game I had played on release, but didn't have the attention span for the introduction, which is an exposition dump.  The entire game is a bit text heavy, but the writing is really descriptive, so if you enjoy exposition you'll be at home.  The story is also more dark than your typical CRPG fair.  \n\nThe tactical, real time pause combat, really hits the spot on hard, as it's not even necessarily that hard, but it punishes you quickly for mistakes.  You can quick save and quick load, so dying a few times isn't that big of a deal, food buffs, consumables, optimizing builds, make the higher difficulties more rewarding.  There are 5 difficulty settings, with more detailed customization.  I don't like inventory management, so there is infinite chest for that on my party.  \n\nI'm really enjoying my time with this game in 2024.  It's what you remember about classic BG1, but properly updated, with a new combat system to enjoy, better graphics, better story telling, and improved quality of life.  \n\nMy only gripe is that vanilla, you can't re-class your storied companions attributes, so they are inherently inferior to a silence mercenary, you can hire at Inns.",

The Steam (and GOG) versions are nice because of cloud saves. I have a tendency to play a bunch one weekend, and not return for several weeks. \n\nThe game is exactly what you'd expect from a PC RPG if you liked the old Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale or Neverwinter Night games. The setting is much different from the old Faerun-based D&D setting of those games, which is novel in itself. And there are some rather interesting differences in character classes versus what you find in D&D that aren't immediately obvious to new players. With Chanter being a really unusual and powerful class, and a very interesting rewrite of the old Bard classes (there were many variants) from D&D. Of course all the classes in PoE have something to offer, with Cipher and Wizard being my favorites.",

        "review": "TLDR; Just play it. This is a masterpiece. \n\nI will be honest I was never so invested in a game before. I was playing PoE after Baldurs Gate 3 and I must say. This game... It hits harder. It makes you question every choice you make. It shows you that there is no happily ever after for all. Everything comes with a price. It has a really strong story that touched something in me that I though I long lost.  \n\nCharacters are top notch. Eder and Aloth are easily the best companions that games have ever seen. Even Durance. Oh, man, I hated him so much at the begging of the game. However, after spending all of the run with him in my party I was really fond of him and his story. All other character (companions and not) have strong writing behind them, especially [spoiler]Iovara. Her story made me shed a tear or two.[/spoiler] \n\nIn general, I truly recommend you to play this game. Just expect it to take a lot of time. I mean. A. LOT. It requires you to pay attention to everything that characters are saying so you could understand the main plot. If you want to understand more regarding world and characters inside of it then expect to spend some time reading in-game books and then reading some wiki. However, personally I do not view it as a drawback. If you ask me was I overwhelmed with that time to time? Yes. Bored? Never. \n\nOne major drawback of this game is that I get weak in the knees for Aloth and Eder but they are not real. Which is unacceptable on theirs part if you ask me.\n\n10/10. Better than Baldurs Gate 3. Fight me if you want.",

        "review": "This game is absolutely amazing. I slept on it for the longest time due to being a little wary of the party based mechanics after playing games like Skyrim. Although initially it took me a minute to get used to the combat, once I got the hang of it, I could not stop playing. I logged over 40 hours in one weekend, which for a guy with a wife and kids is unheard of. This is my first intro into the world of CRPGs, but I am now hooked and have already purchased the sequel, and plan on buying the Divinity series of games as well as Baldur's Gate. Obsidian has created a masterpiece!",

PoE however is also great; it's just a different game, closer to Baldur's Gate 2. Huge nice-looking world, deep real-time combat system and a good story. A ton of content to jump into. Really enjoyed it.\nA few things I didn't like:\n-Main charachter has to be mechanics specialist - you get a lot of traps and secrets and no thief companion until White March 1\n-Most of companions quests feel too short\n-DLC side quests are not marked\n-15 level dungeon\n-Charm and dominance are too imbalance",

Encounters were more intresting and the personal option to skip many dialogues, since you know which ones are important, made the game more enjoyable.  \n  \nThe combat is simple, simple buffs debuffs damage dealing, which gets boring. For me the most irritating combat related issues are that a blinded character can still perform ranged attacks and running out of sight/range/taking cover behind walls don't interrupt spells/attacks.  \nThus, too many encounters feel just the same.  \n\nStealth is an option to avoid encounters, this is the best part, but sadly not enough encounters can be avoided.\n\nWith WM2 i reached the level cap far before even finishing WM1. For me this further reduces motivation to do quest or encounters. \n\nThe stronghold mechanics are simple and thus boring. \n\nThe end story of the game and its options are underwhelming and one is even ridiculus.",

It gets extremely fascinating and interesting during mid-game and what happens - the things you learn - during the final act are just mind-blowing. If you have patience and enjoy reading a lot and learning about the lore in-game I can recommend. The combat system can be tricky as it deviates from the D&D one developing its own, which is refreshing and fun to me but can be confusing at the beginning. The story-telling and lore, the feeling of the world and the history of the world you are inserted in, is extremely well executed, I loved it. Looking forward to play the sequel soon.",

Pillars of Eternity did.\n\nIt is a story both personal and down-to-earth... and grand beyond the scope of mortals,\n\n[i][h1]You are here because you are lost. May you fare better in your next lives.[/h1][/i]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3142361272\nAs far as cRPGs go, I am neither that good at them, usually opting to play on story difficulty for, you guessed it, the story, nor have I played that many. But what I've seen of Pillars of Eternity, I enjoyed - including, and maybe most of all, the challenge of combat.\n\nI played a priest because after finishing BG3, I realised that clerics are kinda OP in these magical worlds. As a priest, you unlock a TON of spells on level up that can provide great damage, great buffs, and healing. Like in D&D, you have a certain amount of spell slots per level per rest, and need to rest to replenish your spells. Some spells are per encounter - so if you want, you can save up and go longer without camping, since you can only carry a limited amount of supplies (6 on easy, 4 on normal, 2 on hard, unlimited on story mode). When you run out of supplies your options are to return to an inn or to your keep - to buy more supplies and to rest (resting in inns and in keep with upgrades gives certain bonuses that persist through camping). \n\nYou will need to camp when your health drops low - which is also an interesting system in PoE I. You have 2 meters - Endurance and Health. When your endurance drops low, your character becomes knocked out, but they can still get up after combat or after a \"res\" ability is used. But if your health runs out, that character dies. Period. Endurance replenishes between encounters, but health does not, so to replenish it you must rest (that's the main way to replenish it).\n\nMy favorite memory from playing this game comes from the very start of it, when you first obtain your keep. I went to explore the dungeons under my keep and on one level, not too far in, I found a hole going deep underground. Of course, I did what any reasonable person in my place would do - and I jumped in it.\n\nOnly to come face to face with a [strike]DRAGON!!!![/strike] drake. There's only 5 in my party, all level 3 or 4 - and I don't have that much in the damage skills department. I don't know where I am and there's no way back - only through. Hours it took me to kill that drake and the adds that would stunlock my party. For the first time, I had to use every buff, every spell slot, every food item, craft potions, craft scrolls, and strategically position my party to outdps the enemy before they would outdps me. \n\nAnd what an experience it made.\n\nAnd Pillars of Eternity is full of such memories.\n\nMainly because the difficulty modes are... strangely balanced. Personally, I can't find rhyme or reason to them, but I can't deny that it might also be a skill issue. Throughout my campaign, I was ping-ponging around between easy, normal, and hard difficulties, trying to adjust my experience when the game became too easy... or too hard.\n\nSay, for example, you're starting on easy. In the first village, in the main square, where you meet one of your first companions, there is a stairway leading down underground. No one tells you to go there, but I mean, [i]it's right there.[/i] So you go down, accept a quest... and the mobs there aren't exactly what you'd expect from an easy difficulty - they will easily steamroll you if you aren't careful, and you need to rest after every pull.  \n\nNot sure how you would tell that you aren't supposed to go there straight away if the difficulty spike relates to you being underlevelled (since it's the beginning of the game), but yeah. It adds its own level of challenge (that I, personally, didn't dislike).\n\nOne time the game kindly asked me if I wanted to increase the difficulty of encounters (outside of the normal difficulty options) since i'm overlevelled for the next zone - and playing on hard at this point, I agreed. How could I have known that the next moment it would spawn 10 spell-casting, club-bonking ogres on me and decimate my party? Moreover, that [i]every[/i] trash pull in that location will be similar? I couldn't have. And I didn't save. I had to put the game back on normal for future locations and sneak through the Elmshore with utmost caution.\n\nAlso an adventure.\n\n[i][h1]What of your cohorts then? They have followed you to their deaths.[/h1][/i]\nThe real main story is the friends we made along the way. There are 8 companions in Pillars of Eternity (and 3 more in the DLC). 3 of them will go on to join the cast of the second game. Pillars of Eternity I, unlike its successor, doesn't feature romance - but in my opinion, it only serves it for the better here. (Although, a couple years ago, I would say it's a major negative point - I'd take Alistairs and roses all day any day, thank you.)\n\nAll of the companions have their own story that needs resolution. I have to be fair, I am not exactly certain what happens if you don't resolve them. I mostly travelled with Eder, Aloth, Durance, Kana and Hiravias/Pallegina, and I think i got a well-rounded and loyal adventuring party. That they don't have any reputation systems only makes it better because you don't have to worry about squabbles.\n\nSome companions have a reputation for being somewhat annoying, but I personally can't see why. I didn't have any trouble with Durance, and the only character I didn't bother resolving the quest of was Grieving Mother (because she's a cipher, she appears kind of late in the game, and I already had a full party anyway).\n\n[i][h1]Your memory shall be your penance.[/h1][/i]\nI imported my save into Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire and so far, I... am not really liking it. For one aspect it improved over the original game, it took two steps back in another. The RTwP combat feels sluggish, the per rest mechanics are gone, you don't get your full array of spells as a priest, and what you do have you can only cast a few times per encounter because... priest charges???? what are those???\n\nPillars of Eternity is just something... One of a kind for me. On the one hand, it makes me sad that its sequel is different. On the other, it makes me appreciate it on its own even more.\n\nIf it wasn't obvious, hard recommend.",

I do not like real-time with pause combat and this game does not change those feelings, I definitely got use to it as I went along but overall I cannot say I enjoy this game's combat. Feels like I need to select all the options to proceed in a dialogue tree which can be irritating specially if I am doing it over and over again because again said combat. \n\nOkay now the positives, I love this game's world, the character building options, the NPCs and party members. This is what kept me going. The world is delightfully bleak, but the characters feel real and there are so many great moments with them. The Stronghold is one of the best parts about the game and is so much fun to upgrade. Overall story is what kept me engage as I wanted to see where it would go and how I would approach certain things. And this makes me excited for Deadfire and Avowed later this year.",

        "review": "I really, really love Pillars of Eternity. I own it on console as well(100%), and I've got as close as 100% as I can here. You can't achieve 'Kickstarter Backer' without having been one as far as I know. Maybe the complete edition has something for that. Why do I bring that up besides to be a little cranky about that? Because I think you can see a lot of other games in Pillars of Eternity as a homage to older RPG games when it was announced as a Kickstarter title. As such you can see quite a few quirks that haven't aged well or feel a bit tossed in for the value of having it over it serving the story and being critical. It feels more like older RPGs for better or worse!\n\nI also personally find the Attribute system to determine things about your character a bit off. A barbarian for example should have decent to high Intellect for AOE swings. Speaking of combat you should be prepared to micromanage and get hit with seemingly random difficult spikes on occasion.\n\nPillars of Eternity starts very dark, and very dour. Your character has an infliction that will drive them insane! But there is no consistent pressure after that, no driving force helping push the player. The pacing falls off and the dour tone for your character doesn't quite hold the strangle that the game implies. As long as I am on writing, Pillars of Eternity is _wordy_. I love hearing about peoples homebrew TTRPGs and have no problems with this, I consider it a positive. If anyone out there doesn't like endless information on a world be aware Pillars of Eternity is a beast.\n\nI'm not blind to the game having some deeper flaws but I view it in a very warm light. I love hearing about the world, I love being in it. I think the companions are interesting and enjoy the variety of personalities since two I really dislike seem to be fan favorites. I love a lot of the weird, outdated quirks of old RPGs for some reason. I think the graphics hold up well and look beautiful, and that the White March is a phenomenal add-on to the game as DLC.  If you're new to TTRPG-style games I would gently recommend another title before going for Pillars of Eternity. Otherwise I'm happy to say I love it.\n\nGeneric pro-tips for the interested:\n\n-I often used summons as bait. This is viable from magical spells to items to an ability Chanters have\n\n-Cipher is my personal favorite class due to its support and debuff nature while still being very present in story options\n\n-Newer players should consider Easy\n\n-Any NPC with a golden background on their name is a Kickstarter NPC. Someone who is not a writer who got put into the game. They are not relevant to anything in the slightest and are dotted through the world as flavor. Quite a few godlikes hah\n\n-There is a Wizard and Fighter in the Gilded Vale as companions, I see people miss them often\n\n-You may feel pressed for time but you are not. Explore and do things as you wish",

        "review": "First and foremost, I can say that I recommend this game. While it can't quite live up to the legacy of Bhaal, it makes a good stab at being a spiritual successor to the infinity engine games.\n\nIt feels like a modernised non-universe take on Baldur's Gate with some Icewind Dale elements that is somehow a little more obtuse yet clear in it's systems than BG/IWD. There is also no multi-classing in this game, but don't worry; all classes have abilities (no bored fighters here) and you class is not set in stone for any character you import into the sequel. I will also note the addition of a fast forward/slow down button, which really takes the time out of travelling around areas that you've already largely cleared. It does lack one key hallmark of the infinity engine games: being able to rest your way to victory; you now have to have supplies to rest anywhere that isn't an inn and you can only carry 4 of these at a time. I do particularly like the separation of health (longer term) and endurance (encounter) too. I like the fact you can lose, gain and have mixed reputations with factions, but I wish they had more impacts, say, on prices like in the sequel.\n\nI really liked the endless paths and the white march content in particular. The battle of Yenwood field was also interesting, as was the relatively dark feeling you get from Raedric's lands. Additionally, white march content is most certainly worth doing and the main quest is also pretty good. I will note, though, that act 3 in particular did feel a little bit empty to me compared to the relative wealth of content available in act 2 or even act 1's offering.\n\nIn terms of companions, you can create your own, but they lack any personality and may as well be \"hollowborn\", so that brings us to the game's companions, all of which have their own quest attached to them and all of which range from fantastic to okay, with most companions weighted towards being fantastic and their quests being weighted towards good, in my opinion.\n\nBut whatever you do, always punch Gathbin.",

        "review": "After finishing two full runs through this game (one solo), it’s fair to say I warmly recommend it. Even though it uses its own RPG mechanics, it feels very faithful to the classic RTwP experience of Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale, except with modern graphics and UI.\n\nI really can’t find much to fault in it except perhaps the frequency of loading screens in towns and indoor areas. The music is immersive, the art is consistently nice, the numerous side quests are impressively diverse and inspired to the point where I kind of want to borrow them for my own tabletop campaigns... and there is certainly no lack of content and lore to lose yourself in for hours upon hours and fun builds to try for a new run or three.",

So you have to play Pillars of Eternity, too. Go get it.\n\nWhat, you're still reading? OK, fine. I bought the second Pillars game and was having a great time. But I kept missing out on all this backstory stuff. It's not like you *need* it, but I wanted to learn more about the crazy events and highly (highly) detailed world from the first game. So I bought it. And now so must you.\n\n(Bonus: a comforting callback to Baldur's Gate that Obsidian threw in.)",

Im so happy to be able to finish this.\n\nPositives\n+ Long ass loading screens at every door gives you the true New Vegas experience\n+ Story mode difficulty, I luv it, I wouldn't finish the game if it wasn't there\n+ Fast Mode!!! The person who put the fast mode has earned a one kiss to cheek from me. It's perfect, makes the game more fun, smoother, it's sooo accessible\n\nNegatives\n- I think PoE does what it tries to do perfectly. I don't know much about these games so IDK if it does a wrong thing. Maybe could add some more things to modernize it and make it more popular for people who dont like cRPG.\n- Realistic avatars are tooooo funny, like my character doesnt look like my avatar at all.",

If you're new to the genre this is a great entry point. Beautifully written story, complex and engaging combat, everything you could want from this type of game, Pillars of Eternity delivers.",

Once you finish your first run I'm sure you'd be going back for seconds. There are many game-play styles to choose from. Numerous classes are available  : both commonly seen in other games and some new ones that are fun to play. I wont spoil which ones . \n \nEach character you make has different opportunities in this world. Nothing is out of reach. \nBe sure to grab the Definitive Edition as the White March DLC adds a lot more to an already expansive world.\n\nAny Critical Role fans will also get a huge plus here :)",

It's overwhelming at times, even with the awesome little links you can click that pull up the in-world history. (That's great. More of that in games please.) I simply cannot exert the amount of effort needed to enjoy this game. Every encounter feels bland, all the skills are essentially the same, and there's nothing for me to grab onto. I felt like a sailor lost at sea, trying to find a piece of driftwood to cling to. It hits you with a brick wall of information and gameplay and world-building. Some people can climb that wall but I just want to find the door to the other side.",

This game is surprisingly well thought through, hard in a realistic way that reminds you of why people act how they do usually and still, you are kind of a hero, struggling in a plot that's too large for anyone to solve. If you ever wanna try Pillars, start with part one if possible, it is worth the effort for the game develops and your actions change a lot for the second part. You might not like the preset choices and might be unable to understand a lot of what is going on, which would be wasted time. Sure, the graphics are kind of simple, but the artwork is well done. The music, well, play your own playlist in the background? The dialogues are good, but if you don't like to read, well, you might not even have read to this point so, just buy the game, it's much better than it looks like.",

        "review": "\n\tFrom the studio that brought you STAR WARS: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords and Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian Entertainment delivers a beautifully crafted cRPG with Pillars of Eternity.  Paying homage to ‘Baldurs Gate’ and ‘Icewindale,’ Obsidian Entertainment helps breathe life back into isometric cRPGs. Gather your party and venture forward as you embark on an adventure filled with dungeon-infested monsters, war-torn politics, and magic that allows you to read others' souls. Prepare yourself to enter the world of Eora, where your choices and paths will forever shape your destiny.\n\nPillars of Eternity places a strong emphasis on character creation and development. Players can choose between eleven unique classes, six different races, and backgrounds that influence the players’ skills, abilities, and interactions within the Eastern Reach. Another standout feature is the beautifully crafted world that is Eora. Boasting hand-drawn artwork, you can see the attention to detail within the game. The bustling cities and ancient dungeons are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Each environment feels alive, teeming with history, lore, and a sense of mystery that beckons players to explore every nook and cranny.\n\n\nThe storyline in Pillars of Eternity is something we come to love and expect from Obsidian. Featuring a dark and bleak narrative that explores themes of souls, reincarnation, and the consequences of the player’s choices that impact the storyline and characters–leading to multiple branching paths and endings. \n\nLet’s not forget another thing Obisidian excels at, loveable and life-like companions. Edér Teylecg; the well-articulated veteran from the Saint's War with a blackly humorous outlook on life. Aloth Corfiser; the obsessive elven wizard blinded by his duty. Or Kana Rua;  an Aumaua chanter on a quest to discover the secrets below Caed Nua. With up to eight recruitable companions in the base game, with an additional three more in the expansions, you’ll find yourself lost for hours in conversation, or party configuration to suit your play style. \n\nPillars of Eternity excels at providing a challenging yet rewarding experience. The isometric perspective and real-time pause combat system are executed with precision, offering a strategic depth that caters to both seasoned RPG veterans and newcomers alike. The variety of classes, skills, and abilities contribute to the gameplay experience that remains consistently engaging throughout the entire journey. I found myself captivated by the overall combat experience. Spending hours learning the system, reading about different buffs and debuffs, and meticulously crafting my party for the right fight. \n\nI was entranced by the wonderful score composed by Justin Bell. The music perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, evoking emotions from awe to tension and enhancing the overall immersive experience. I felt the same set of emotions the first time I heard the score from Howard Shore in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Beautiful and elegant, I found myself listening to the score outside of the game. \nPillars of Eternity stands as a shining example of what a classic RPG can achieve in the modern era. It successfully marries the nostalgia of the past with the innovation of the present, forging an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a seasoned RPG enthusiast or a newcomer eager to explore a rich fantasy world, Pillars of Eternity is an absolute must-play that will leave you eagerly anticipating what Obsidian Entertainment has in store for the future of the genre.\n",

        "review": "As many have already pointed out, the game tends to lean on the dull side, both in terms of combat and story. The combat is this odd mix of being overly complex and strangely simplistic, with the game not bothering to give much insight into its mechanisms. Some fights are a breeze, while others catch you off guard, with seemingly harmless mobs dealing one-shot blows to your team members. Plus, the dialogues can be a real snooze-fest, thanks to the overwhelming wall of text. Not to mention, not all dialogues are voiced—only a fraction of them are.\n\nWhile I get that reading through walls of text is a hallmark of CRPG games, not every tradition is worth keeping. Even games like DAO, developed back in 2010, did a much better job of guiding players through their worlds and stories without drowning them in text.\n\nIn conclusion, the game has its merits, but it's not a universal hit. Don't let the glowing reviews blindside you. It's probably a good idea to check out some gameplay videos on YouTube before taking the plunge. And when I say some, I mean more than one.\n\n[b] GRAPHICS [/b]\n\n🔵 MS-DOS graphic\n🔘 Ugly, but still bearable\n🔘 Fine, nothing too fancy\n🔘 Pretty good\n🔘 Next gen graphic or art\n[hr][/hr]\n[b] STORY [/b]\n\n🔘 What is the story?\n🔘 Written by 5 years old child\n🔵 Something that'll hook you up with the game\n🔘 You can remember the story after you finished the game for a while\n🔘 You cannot get it out of your head\n[hr][/hr]\n[b] FUN [/b]\n\n🔘 You want to delete it after a few minutes\n🔵 A bit here and there\n🔘 Could be bored after a while\n🔘 Can keep you entertained for hours straight\n🔘 It's already morning?\n[hr][/hr]\n[b] MUSIC [/b]\n\n🔘 Just mute it\n🔵 Few of them are good\n🔘 Not the best, but it's good\n🔘 You get immersed in the game\n🔘 Sometimes you will need to stop playing the game to hear it.\n[hr][/hr]\n[b] REPLAY VALUE [/b]\n\n🔘 One-time experience\n🔘 There could be another path or character build that you wanna try\n🔵 You will most likely play it at least 1 more time\n🔘 Let's have the 10th playthrough to try this new build found online!\n🔘 Say goodbye to your youth\n[hr][/hr]\n[b] DIFFICULTY LEVELS[/b]\n\n🔘 Must be a Souls game\n🔘 Could be too hard or too easy for some people\n🔘 There is only one difficulty level, but it offers a reasonably challenging experience\n🔘 There is more than one difficulty level\n🔵 There are at least 3 difficulty levels, and there are options for a custom game\n[hr][/hr]\n\n\n[h1] TOTAL SCORE:  16/30 [/h1]\n\n[i]\n\n>=24: you don't want to miss this masterpiece\n>=18: definitely worth the price\n>=10: if its on sale or free, you could consider to try it\n<10: don't waste your time on it\n[/i]\n",

        "review": "[h2]Pillars Of Eternity Definitive Edition Review[/h2]\n\nI never intended to spend much time on this game; probably 40-50 hrs at most, but before I knew it I had ended up spending 120+ hours in-game! Review is after completing the main game and all dlc and both expansions; including all main quests, companion quests, side quests and tasks on Normal difficulty. \n\n[h3]Pros:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]I enjoyed all the reading, especially the named NPC backstories. All the expertly written exposition surprisingly helped with one of my English exams!\n\n[*]The game allowed me to delay levelling up, which is a highly appreciated feature. I was able to level up based on the challenge the game offered at each progressive stage.\n\n[*]The game had a relaxed inventory system that promoted hoovering up all loot. After all, in a world with magic why would they even need to worry about carry-weight?\n\n[*]I particularly liked the Wizards summoning of [b]thick[/b] [i]slimy[/i] tentacles with which to pound enemies!\n\n[*]The game soundtrack was entertaining and the option to download it and enjoy it at leisure was most welcome.\n\n[*]Side quests supplied choices that had both large and small consequences in later Acts and in the ending.\n\n[*]This game is called the spiritual successor to Baldur’s Gate; in my opinion this is appropriate.\n\n[*]Companion quests had strong writing, excellent voice acting and were quite varied. I liked how some of them provided closure while others didn’t necessarily do so; as is often the case in reality.\n\n[*]There are no romance options in the game. Perfect! It would have made zero sense for my wild Orlan to romance my odd brigade of companions. Obsidian didn’t shoehorn romance into this game and that is ideal.\n\n[*]Figuring out the use of AI combat patterns and group formations felt smooth and organic.\n\n[*]At the beginning of the DLC and Act3, the game inquired if I wanted to increase the challenge as I was overleveled. I declined, as the overleveled state was intentional. But the feature to ask the player’s choice was most welcome.\n\n[*]The game provides named unique items, which can be upgraded or enchanted depending on the item type. The DLC also adds more unique weapons that can be bound to certain characters by fulfilling various conditions. I felt this was a very thematic and appropriate system considering the lore of the game.\n\n[*]I was quite saturated at the point of playing the White March Part 2. Over 100 hours in this game I never intended to invest in. So I lowered the difficulty a notch to help speed through fights faster. As such, the ability to adjust difficulty at any time was much appreciated.\n\n[*]Notable voice acting by the actors for Eder, Aloth and Durance. All other companions also have superb voice acting. Moreover, I felt the main villain’s voice actor played their part incredibly well. The majority of side characters also had decent voice acting.\n\n[*]Speaking of world building: now that I have devoted over 100+ hours into this game I am fully invested in the world of Eora. All that’s left to say is: “More please!”\n\n[*]The game dropped hints of the Deadfire Archipelago, setting up some lore for the next game.\n[/list]\n[h3]Cons:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]While it appeared enticing to obtain all the achievements of this game, some of them required a level of dedication I simply couldn’t spare.\n\n[*]At the 90% mark of Act 2, I felt overloaded. After exploring the entire world map thus far, the game dumped a new capital city with its own culture and lore on me. I was weighed down by this, especially because I felt their culture was uncivilised and barbaric and it tested my patience. Perhaps because, at this point I just wanted to be done with Act 2.\n\n[*]Loading times were bad right from the beginning of the game and progressively got worse. Quicksaving felt like the easier option. Manual saving or loading felt like a painful option.\n\n[*]When playing the White March Part 2 I experienced occasional freezing of the game. Waiting for about 1 to 2 minutes resolved these issues.\n\n[*]When loading the save file list doing a mouse click would freeze the game. Windows asked whether to close POE but being patient resolved the issue.\n[/list]\n[h3]Advice:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]I played while occasionally referring to a walkthrough from Gamefaqs. I learned that lesson from playing Divinity Original Sin. My advice is explore and play a new map area/dungeon as you please while manual saving often. Then refer to the walkthrough to check if you missed any hidden area/item/quest/approach/dialogue. As this is a large game, investing in a second playthrough can be extremely time consuming. Therefore, it’s best to experience the complete buffet of game content in the very first playthrough.\n\n[*]Another benefit of referring to a walkthrough was discovering the optimal playthrough order. That would be: PoE Act 1, PoE Act 2, White March P1, PoE Act 3, White March P2, PoE Epilogue. That approach covered all of the Definitive Edition content in a chronological manner.\n\n[*]The dragon battles were the toughest in my opinion; the other encounters could be managed using kiting, drawing enemies to narrow corridors or springing traps or ambushes. \n\n[*]The game dumps a large amount of lore and history from character creation itself. Much of it didn’t make sense until Act 2 and onwards; therefore, a healthy amount of patience is required. Perhaps this was intentional as the developers had to create all this new lore and world history from scratch; certainly no easy task.\n\n[*]Wizards are the most fun class and next would be priests. Their wide range of spells, buffs and debuffs offered the greatest opportunity for creative problem solving gameplay.\n\n[*]Refer to an online build guide. I played as a Wild Orlan (furry), paladin, sword and shield tank built to specifications. Therefore, I had a much smoother combat experience having an incredibly durable tank character.\n[/list]\n\nSo what exactly are these so-called Pillars of Eternity? For me they represent the entire world of Eora and its various mechanisms; its cycles combined with the various race’s attempts to understand those mechanisms while living their daily lives.\n\nWe got to take better care of Aloth! - Eder.\nOverall Score 9/10",

There wasn't. My memory is bad for a reason, because there is nothing particularly interesting about this game. It's a bland interpretation of a dungeons and dragons-like ruleset, in a half-baked fantasy world that's plastered over the world and story that they actually seem to have wanted to tell. The same studio, and many of the same people, have made vastly better worlds to explore. This one is just a proof of concept that didn't need to be created.",

I'm in the middle of the woods with flint and tinder in my bag, but I can't rest because I'm out of \"camping supplies\"?

        "review": "Having ventrued from your homeland to another nation in search of home, your caravan is attacked for tresspassing on local ruins, forcing you to flee and witness a mysterious ritual, performed on one of machines left by a lost civilization. In effect you become the Watcher - a being who can see and interact with osuls. Howere, it has also awakened you to your past life. And if you won't find a way to undo it, Awakening will consume your mind.\n\nPillars of Etenrity is a retro cRPG in style of first two Baldur's Gate games or Planescape Torment. Indeed, it takes a lot of inspiration from those titles. Although the classic fantasy elements are present, the game is far from unoriginal. It's technological level is closest to XVII Century than medieval times, allowing you to use guns alongside meele weapons, bows, crossbows and magic. The story takes on themes of gnosticism and Nietschean philosophy, while dealing with often truly morally grey situations. Meaning not the cowardly mainstream \"both sides are wrong and only Enlightened Centrism is right\" or \"these people have a point, but their methods are wrong so they're evil\", but carefully crafted situations where you can see how even worst acts can, to some extent, be justified. You will be often forced to take decisions that are not purely good or evil, even the possible third option, if any such exists. The lore also is interesting, full of stories of cycles of violence rooted in colonialism this region suffered, tragedies of ancient times coming to haunt the world once again and games played by the gods.\n\nThe game uses an isometric view, with a \"real time with a pause\" , during which you control a party of six characters, where positioning and use of specific abilities of various classes is important. While you can make separate characters as mercernaries, you also get to recruit a colorful cast of characters, from fan-favorite laid back farmboy war veteran Eder, to enigmatic Grieving Mother.  Each one of them is haunted by their own goals and demons, be it Kana Nua's  quest to find ancient writing of his people's ancetors, Pagelina's dilemma between loyalty and pragmatism, Hiravia's crisis of faith or fascinating deep hidden secrets of Durance, Grieving Mother and Aloth. The characters are unique and feel like natural progression of archetype deconstructions that we have seen in classic Baldur's Gate I and II. \n\nOne of the interestign aspects that even more advanced games in the genre do not always posses (looking at you, Baldur's Gate 3, whose protagonist doesn't get his own tent for some reason) is the stronghold that the player will acquire at the end of the first act. You can build and expand it, which helps for a long time offset the issue of huge amounts of money at your disposal. You also get to take guests, make decisions regarding various visitor's goals, often being able to play them for your advantage or allow your party members to handle them, take up bounties for challengign enemies or send idle party members on quests you later get nice short narratives. Unlike Dragon Age Inquisition, you never feel like you're doing busywork, while the NPCs handle cool quests, however - even if the adventures your companions had off-screen foten are interesting, so are your own quests. Also, there is an absolutely amazing megadungeon beneath the  stronghold as well, not to mention quest in which you have to defend your claim to it, cullminating in an amazing battle.\n\nMany segments are handled through hsorter narratives, where you can get different outcomes if you usecharacters with high enough attributes, which cut down on some busywork aspects of a game like this. Attributes also unlock new dialogue options, a system that Disco Elysium would perfect years later. Unlike many games, the mechanics are designed so that there is no one stat to rule them all and every attribute is as useful for meele or caster characters.\n\nWorth mentioning is als othe music, which you probably have heard if you are a fan of Critical Role, as Obsidian was kind enough to let them use it on their streams for years.\n\nPillars of Eternity has aged gracefully and, even if the cRPG genre may have progressed with the likes of Pathfinder, Diso Elysium or Baldur's Gate 3, this game is still a source of many enjoyable hours of interesting story in old school style. I will also rip off the hell out of it for my d&d games ;)",

        "review": "(This is the most recent \"update\" to the review: I'm 100 hours in now and I still consider this as a somewhat of an underrated crpg. It's beautiful, stylish, and has the same vibe as Baldur's Gate 2. The more I've played this the more I've grown to appreciate this. It really is like the actual sequel to Baldur's Gate 2 and I think many might have missed this due to the naming).\n\nThe actual review:\n\nI've played PoE on another computer via another platform so the Steam hours don't reflect the actual hours played.\n\nThe game feels more like Baldur's Gate II than BG3 does. In general I like the style and the overall feeling of this game over BG3. The visual style is gorgeous, even though textures are not sharp when zoomed in. The battle mechanics and stats etc. take learning and a lot of things are not explained clearly enough. I had to watch a guide on youtube to learn about stuff that I hadn't known about during dozens and dozens of hours of play prior to watching the guide. I assume there's still more to learn. This is not a minus though, if you're aware that you need to use some outside resources to understand the systems well.\n\nThe game is not easy by any means and requires a lot of reading into what different spells and abilities etc. do. Knowing what spell and ability does is what makes the gameplay easier and more fun. It's still challenging though (based on my experience on hard difficulty). One gets most out of the game when really taking things slow and reading the lore that the game presents, reading info (stats, abilities and lore) on beasts etc. Really taking in the whole setting helps to see and appreciate what the devs have done with this project. Btw. Pausing the game prior to the combat action is already combat gameplay. Impatience kills the fun, I've noticed. So again, understand that taking things slow and appreciating all the minute details is how one gets most out of the experience.\n\nTo me, this is one of the best crpg's, at least when it comes to the overall style, lore (BG2 might be better though), and the overall vibe and immersion. It's like some of the classics (BG1, BG2, Icewind Dale 1&2, Fallout 1&2, Arcanum etc.) but with better graphics while staying true to the classic 2D-graphics style and not killing the immersive old school feeling with some more modern looking execution.\n\nDefinitely recommended, if you're into this kind of a setting and have patience. The game is just lovely. (Edit: I made this last comment prior to having been presented with some f*cked up sh*t by the game. I'll withdraw the \"lovely\" and replace it with \"great\" with some surprisingly twisted and dark themes. Although I guess it's nothing that hasn't been dealt with in Game of Thrones as well, for example... Anyway, I could have gone without it).\n\nEdit #2:\n\nAnd one little extra tip for making the adventuring even more immersive. Instead of using the hotkey on a whim, to see whether or not there are interactables and info spots in an area that your party is at, use a D20 and throw that to see whether or not you can press the hotkey. A little rule that I use is that manual searching with the mouse cursor is still permitted, even if the throw fails, but with using only the mouse there are some things that are bound to be missed that otherwise would be easy to notice with the hotkey. This approach is more immersive and fun in my opinion though.\n\nAnd one can use a perception check from the D&D rules, for example. Or whatever works or feels best. So far I've just simply rolled a D20 to see what number I have to exceed to succeed with the check and then add +2 to the perception roll (per my character's stats and active effects). If the initial \"difficulty check\" is 3 or less I just don't use that bonus and roll anyway instead of having it to be an instant success. Oh yeah, and a strict rule that makes this kind of a \"perception check\" meaningful is that one can use it only once in any given area that is visible on the screen at a given time, and not use it anymore over that location, after having made a failed check.",

The first mistake was not assuming it would be like other TTRPG style games, and choosing to play a class which had too many spells to pick from, right at the beginning. \n\nIf you're new to this game, I would suggest a 'simple' fighter-style class to start with, so that you get used to the mechanics, and then on subsequent playthroughs, you choose one of the more 'complex' classes. \n\nThe story is pretty good, it's engaging enough whilst having some of that D&D charm (note, not a D&D game, but that's the bar against which everything is compared in the VTT world). The overall world building is excellent, and possibly my favourite part of the game.\n\nI read somewhere that they were planning a tabletop ruleset for the game, but I haven't heard anything about that for a few months, so maybe there were some problems in playtesting.\n\nEither way, this is a good game, if you like the genre of old school CRPG, and I highly recommend playing it.",

        "review": "Even when playing Pillars of Eternity for the first time my heart started to feel a strange tingling around it.  A tingling that slowly turned into a warm embrace the more I traversed through the world of Eora. I was certain then - this was going to be one of the special ones for me. \n\nIt only takes the first notes of the main theme to hit your ears and dreams of dragons, mighty battles and potent fantasy will fill your mind. The gentleness of the song only hints at the iconic soundtrack that will accompany you and your party throughout the whole story.\n\nYou’ll feast your eyes on isometric goodness of caves, mountains, keeps, battlefields, forests and everything in between. A charming art style which, while being an homage to its predecessors, still manages to stand on its own. Amazing sights are spread throughout the whole world. Sights that will make you want to relax by the lake, browse the city market or whichever vista grabs your eye and imagination.\n\nA mysterious plot involving gods and the cycle of rebirth will be unfolding the more you progress. While many pieces to the puzzle might be missing in the beginning, once all is done you will be able to see where they were hiding. In the process of doing so you will also uncover and experience the grandeur of Eora, its gods and the people that inhabit it.\n\nChaotic battlefields and, at times, unfair battles will challenge you throughout your entire adventure. It does get easier with time. But, the difficulty is there. You will feel overwhelmed and put against impossible odds. However, despair not. This only makes the joys of victory that more bountiful. That is, if you succeed in persevering throughout the challenging times that await you.\n\nSome of my most epic fights I’ve had are here. And they took a lot of planning, preparation, adjustment and exploiting weaknesses as best as I could. Walking the Path of the Damned made the combat no joke for me. Especially the dragons that I faced. Each presenting a new challenge. And a new weakness to find and take advantage of. \n\nPillars manages to pull off what great art is capable of. Create and match vastly different elements together. Elements that succeed in complimenting each other in effortless and perfect harmony. And while I can see its faults and how some people might not be able to get into it I’d say this - if you are a fan of CRPG’s, or video game art, this one is a must try. Pillars of Eternity might not be perfect, but for me it’s close enough.\n",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is an old-school RPG in the spirit of Balder's Gate I and II.  The game's setting is sufficiently original to feel fresh and different, but with enough familiar elements to hook traditional fantasy lovers.  The story is intricate and the characters are definitely fun and memorable.  The downside for some will be the lack of a turn-based mode (don't let this turn you away because it's easy to adapt to the pause and play mechanic) and the deep lore of the game which does require a healthy bit of reading (the lore is well written and engaging so I would also encourage giving it a shot, even if this makes you cautious).  I definitely recommend it for anyone looking to play old-school open world RPG that takes place in an original and engaging game world with tons of flavor.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is what I would consider a baseline for good RPGs. It's engaging and feels good to play, but never quite made me fall in love with it like the best RPGs can do. If I wasn't also playing its sequel, I doubt I would think about this game a month from now. With that said, it does have a lot of qualities that makes it stand out enough to be well worth playing.\n\nGameplay-wise, PoE is both terrible and great. Terrible because of the stealth option being tied to searching, which means that you have to move at half speed if you want to find any traps or secrets, something that bogs the game down a lot. Great because of the combat, which often involves varied enemies and scenarios, with competent AI and some fun abilities. I specifically enjoyed how AoE abilities work, where if the outer rim hits your party it won't harm them, allowing for some ease of use while still requiring some aiming. It's clear that a lot of care went into combat feel in the game, and it's unfortunate that other areas were left a bit undercooked in comparison. I never really liked moving around the world, which is a shame.\n\nEven more so because the world building is so effective. Many parts goes into this, including the excellent story-book skill checks and dialogue descriptions, but I think the main thing deserving praise compared to many other RPGs is how PoE melds its world building into the story. Reading book excerpts and asking locals about their history and politics aren't just flavour or momentarily relevant, it plays a part in what is happening in the bigger plot and, more importantly, [b]why[/b]. It doesn't hurt that the main plot of the game is really good, a mystery where new revelations seamlessly expand your understanding of events. When it gets going, it's very easy to get swept up in it all, and the world building only adds to that.\n\nWith that said, the story has a couple of flaws. One is set up and pay off. In the first hour or two, you are introduced to the game as a kind of settler-native conflict. There are ruins that the natives don't want desecrated, which is presented as a big deal. Now, that conflict does exist in the game, but it's far from the main focus, or even the emotional core of the story. This kind of set up without a satisfying pay off happens several times and, while it could be seen as red herrings, hurts your ability to care about the story. This is further impacted by the second problem, the characters. While their interactions throughout the game are well executed and much better than some older Obsidian games, they still lack the edge that makes a character memorable. I got the sense that if each character got dropped into another RPG, they would be the dullest character in that game, with maybe one or two exceptions. Again, it hurts your ability to resonate with the game emotionally, which is a shame.\n\nI want to end on a positive, so let's talk about the morality system. It's clearly a focus for Obsidian to make morality non-binary in their games and instead make it more fluid, like the real world often is. And I think they did a good job here; choices can still be good or evil, but the emphasis is put on other values like honesty or aggressiveness. Because of that, each choice is more free and thus requires more thought. Isn't it right to be aggressive towards an enemy that seems like they would give up if given a reason? Can you really be merciful towards a serial killer and still be in the right? It's something that few RPGs do successfully, and this game is probably the best one that I've played in that respect. More games should take after this way of handling morality.\n\nOverall, I really liked Pillars of Eternity. More than I expected beforehand, to be honest. A lot of problems that exist in other games are solved here and that's a clear strength of the game. At the same time, problems are also created here that I haven't seen in any other game. Basically, it's very different from your standard RPG. If that is a draw or a deterrent is up to you, but I do think it's well worth trying out.",

It's got some interesting elements and you can tell the devs put a lot of effort into creating and interesting world. That said, for the most part I found it boring, there's multiple systems that do not quick click which makes it boring in the end. The fighting is repetitive and requires too much micromanagement. The world building is interesting but the way it's presented it's way too much information too quickly which makes it hard to follow, and that led me to just skip the flavour parts which I never do in these kinds of games. The trap searching mechanics are terrible, basically you have to stealth to find traps which makes exploration tedious as you have to go everywhere using stealth (which is slow) or risk running triggering them. Inventory management is a chore and the usable items seem so weak that I never bothered using them. Finally, almost every time I felt like quest resolution and dialogue options were not the best, they either lead to boring outcomes or the outcome that you'd want is not available to chose from.",

        "review": "Background: I discovered Pillars of Eternity in the context of finding games with similar, if not the same, \"real-time party-based RPG\" feel as Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel (a childhood favorite of mine). I played the game on normal difficulty and completed all main quests, side quests & tasks. As I usually play games largely for the story while setting reasonable difficulty, I don't intend to have further playthroughs with the game.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game for almost 200 hours. The plot/story is engaging and I was pleasantly surprised when its puzzle pieces started to come together in the Final Act. The wide conversation options and the consequences stemming from them are impressive. The companions you encounter in the game enrich the experience with their takes on your journeys together. The graphics were decent, at least for its age. \n\nAs this is only my second time playing with such a game (after Fallout Tactics), I was shocked but had fun dealing with the complex game mechanics: many classes & races, 8 damage types, 4 categories of defenses, 6 attributes with impacts that do not seem intuitive at first (e.g., a barbarian frontline crowd-control character needing high Intellect attribute for its abilities and talents to be more useful), and a lot more. To keep up with the complexities of the game, I actually had to make tables of abilities/talents/spells/chants/invocations and statistics of enemy types detailing their strengths and weaknesses. There is also a nice figure available online by user Gairnulf that details the effects of the attributes: https://pillarsofeternity.fandom.com/wiki/Attributes?file=Attribute_effects.png. All of these somehow made the game less overwhelming for me.\n\nPerhaps the two issues (albeit minor and forgivable) I have with the game that I can think of is that (1) some of the written dialog have no voice counterpart or have a slightly different voice counterpart and (2) there are several instances when I had to read blocks and blocks of text in the game to make sense of something.\n\nOverall, this game is a great exercise on exploring nuanced consequences of choices - from gameplay when creating your characters and allotting points to their attributes, skills, abilities, talents and spells/chants/invocations to story progression. I look forward to play Pillars of Eternity II in the future.",

Make sure you save a lot in case you go too far under your keep too early and wait to do the Concelhaut (or however it's spelled) area until you're just before the end of the game.  The statue tells you when you first get the quest that you aren't strong enough for that area yet, but don't just think one or two more levels will do.\n\nOverall:  Worth it, recommend.",

        "review": "[h1] Don't let the dull first couple of hours dissuade you... this deep RPG is one of the greats[/h1]\n\n[i]Pillars of Eternity[/i] is \"classic\" style RPG heavily influenced by [i]Baldur's Gate[/i], complete with a massive world to explore, plenty of side content, gorgeous isometric backgrounds, and highly tactical realtime-with-pause combat.  Although it never reaches the heights of [i]Baldur's Gate[/i], it's overall a more consistently enjoyable experience start to finish, and is also a much fairer game.  Regardless of its issues, it ends up being a fine spiritual successor to [i]Baldur’s Gate[/i] and a fantastic RPG on its own.\n[hr][/hr]\nThe game ends up having a very interesting story, but takes a bit too long to get there, with the first couple of hours being particularly dull since you basically have no idea what’s going on with the story.  Instead of seeming mysterious, it comes off as meaningless… and then you spend the vast majority of the game doing stuff that basically has very little to do with the plot.  The game also suffers from being wordy and overwritten, with the actual good writing being buried under flowery descriptions and excessive exposition.\n[hr][/hr]\nFortunately, playing the game is a wonderful experience.  There’s a massive world to explore, intriguing mysteries to solve, and a fascinating combat system to learn.\n\nQuesting is a highlight of the game.  Many quests have multiple solutions, with some options available only for certain types of characters; sometimes, you may just not be persuasive or wise enough to resolve things peacefully, and the only choice will be to fight it out.\n\nAnd it’s a great combat system.  Although it seems completely overwhelming at first, with several damage types and resistances to track, the game actually gives you all the information you need to understand its nuances, right there in the combat log.  Even better, encountering the same enemy multiple times slowly adds more and more information to its bestiary log, and simply hovering the mouse cursor over an enemy will give you the full rundown on its strengths and weaknesses.  Difficult combat encounters then become extremely tactical, with you slowly stripping away enemy defenses while building up your own.\n\nSimilarly deep is how you build your characters and party.  The system provides you with a ton of flexibility in how you want to play the game; unlike many other RPGs, there are no attributes that are completely useless for certain classes.  A high Might Wizard will play very differently from a high Intellect Wizard, and both characters would actually be very viable to play.\n[hr][/hr]\nAll in all, an excellent RPG that’s a must play for any fan of the genre, particularly fans of [i]Baldur’s Gate[/i] or [i]Icewind Dale[/i].  Highly, highly recommended!",

Good story, not fantastic. Good gameplay, but gets so easy by the end it gets boring.\n\nOn the other hand on a scale of 1 to 10 for normal RPGs, this is a 10. It outshines other lesser works by a large margin.\n\nIt's only when compared it with other works of fantastic genius and ability that it gets outshined.",

It has that old-timey feel of the older RPG games and (for those of us who get easily motion sick) a stable, third person, top-down view (Yay!). Although Pillars of Eternity exists in their own fantasy world (FYI, think Dragon Age in terms of available in-game lore: MASSIVE), players of any D&D game will recognize a lot of the battle tactics (real-time combat), wizard spells, and priest abilities. PoE does bring a few new things to the table, like new classes (e.g., ciphers, chanters) that are a lot of fun to play with, new weapons (gunpowder!), and a Divinity-esque approach to class skills and crafting (but with less confusion). The main plot is unique (think Wheel of Time, but vastly improved upon) and very grimdark. Side plots vary between dungeon crawls or dialogue-heavy tasks that cultivate MPC's personal reputation. And the companions vary between adorable-let-me-take-you-everywhere to why-isn't-there-an-option-to-murder-you. Soundtrack is beautiful. Artwork is good. My only true complaint... and that's said more wryly than anything else... is the excessive wordiness in everything. Think of a promising fanfiction writer who is trying to employ as many adjectives as possible. It's not bad, per se, but... wordy, lol. In short, PoE deserves a place next to the old classics and is solid enough to stand on its own. The White March DLC adds even more flavor and interesting companions.",

        "review": "If you're already a fan of CRPGs, give Pillars of Eternity a try. If you're new to CRPGs, I wouldn't recommend starting here. \n\nThe reason I wouldn't recommend PoE to someone who isn't already invested in CRPGs is because, when compared to contemporaries such as Divinity: Original Sin 1 and 2, Baldur's Gate 3, and Disco Elysium, it is not as, well, \"fun.\" Don't get me wrong, I do think it's good, but it's nowhere near as engaging as the best modern CRPGs. It took *me* three attempts before I finally finished a playthrough, and I think that's because the game is a little... drab. Especially in the beginning. The story takes a while to build and, in my opinion, it isn't until Act II that things really get interesting. (From Act II on, the story does become rather captivating, with seriously thought-provoking themes.) But the environments are same-y and mostly generic meadows, the tone is very dry, the combat is micromanage-y real-time-with-pause (with A.I. options), and playing involves a lot of reading of rather plain prose.\n\nNow for the reasons why I think Pillars of Eternity might still be enjoyed by someone who *is* invested in CRPGs. While I think PoE's world may be mostly visually uninteresting, Obsidian took great care to develop a realized setting. I think their world-building is strong, and the lore they've written is interesting. A lot of the finer details of the world's religion, government, history, etc. is there if you choose to dig a little, but the main story revolves around the lore in a very satisfying way, so the more you give the more you get. And, as I said above, by Act II you will be more invested in the world and its mysteries. Role-playing options are given this same attention, with your character being defined by and remembered for their actions and the context behind those actions beyond \"good\" and \"evil\" (i.e., were you benevolent, diplomatic, indifferent, aggressive, cruel, etc.). You are given a plethora of (oft difficult) choices, big and small, that affect not only the fate of the world, but the fate of small villages you encountered, and the paths your companions take after the events of the story. These choices are not always obvious, often coming through seemingly insignificant dialogue options, encouraging you to carefully consider your character and exactly how they would react in a given situation. Play a consistent character [note: \"consistent\" =/= one-dimensional] and your ending will feel earned. If you enjoy CRPGs, you will find Pillars of Eternity to be a fulfilling RPG experience.\n\n(P.S. As a bonus, the White March DLCs are even better than the base game! Definitely pick them up.)",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is one of those games I really wanted to like, but I couldn’t.\n\nI first played this game when it released 8 years ago. I quit after 20 hours, but the thought of finishing it has been lurking at the back of my mind ever since. So, after 8 years, I finally decided to give it another go.\n\nI’m the type of gamer who loves RPGs, and I especially love Obsidian Entertainment’s earlier games: KOTOR 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout: New Vegas. They are classics. Unfortunately, Pillars of Eternity is not one of them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in one word, I would describe it as “tasteful”. The story, the art, the writing are all consistent and well executed.\nThe soundtrack is outstanding. One of the best soundtracks I’ve ever heard in a video game, Justin Bell did an excellent job for sure.\nI have to give credit where credit is due, Pillars of Eternity is a tasteful game.\n\nYet, during my 60 hour playthrough, it never really hooked me.\n\nThe game is set in a medieval fantasy world, which feels unique in its own right.\nI'm happy Obsidian Entertainment finally has their own IP! I admire the rich lore of Eora, and I‘m excited for future games set in the same universe (i.e. Avowed).\n\nThe issue is, lore building is not enough in itself. It's not engaging content, at least not for me.\nI’ve played a lot of RPGs and I would say I enjoy reading more than most people, but there’s a limit.\nThe endless exposition in this game is just excessive. The characters are constantly talking about past events that, when you think about it, have little to no relevance to the story.\n\nThe story, in a nutshell, is about the reincarnation of souls and about the gods.\nIt’s not my cup of tea, I prefer stories that are more personal. I found it hard to relate to any of the characters and to actually get invested in the plot.\n\nA couple other pain points I had:\n\n- The combat was fun for a while, but it became a chore mid-game. The only character I enjoyed controlling throughout was Aloth.\n- The leveling was quite disappointing for me. You can’t increase your attributes and skills are useless. You need to rely on “talents” instead. It was difficult to wrap my head around this, I had no idea how to build a character well, what talents to pick, what items to use.\n- The Kickstarter characters and tombstones are immersion-breaking.\n- The long loading screens are off-putting.\n- The game is too dark sometimes. I noticed this on multiple occasions and there’s no in-game setting to make it lighter.\n\nAs I said, it's a well-made game, but it hasn't captured my attention. I found it mildly interesting, but I can't recommend it.",

This isn't the sort of RPG where you need to collect four crystals to unlock the boss. There's no morality system. No 'right way' to play it. Instead it asks the player to imagine themselves in a bewildering and broken land, and challenges them to form their own conclusions\n\nA masterclass in worldbuilding. Voice acting is stellar. Visuals are polished and lovingly crafted. Combat mechanics are quite deep, but even on the hardest difficulty level there weren't many encounters that took more than two tries\n\nIt's a few years old, but hasn't lost it's sheen. Great game",

I also understand what they were trying to do with the attributes system and the \"every build is viable\" idea, but here again, I found the result hard to understand and hard to work with. The fact that equipment bonuses don't stack and get \"suppressed\" is also another strange design choice that makes everything more annoying. I just didn't have fun, so I stopped playing.",

I throws new and weird lore at you constantly with the expectation that you're supposed to just know it and it doesn't explain just how integral some of the story moments in early game are to the rest of the game. I thought that the problem with newborn was just for the current area and not that it played as pivotal of a role to the story and didn't know how much I should care about it but uh, yeah, you ought to care.\n\nThe game's story is good but I think that the problem with the game is that it is all story (or rather all writing, expect A LOT of reading). Most of the actual gameplay is just... Confusing. You control 6 characters in real time with pause where there are 4 different damage resistance types that you need to memorize and each weapon has a different think it affects and classes have tons of weird names for spells and abilities that aren't very clear as to what they do and out of nowhere a character loses 60% health and you have no idea what the hell just happened.\n\nStick to 4 dialogue personality types (they pop in dialogue like \"[Stoic] I got balls of steel\") and expect the game to screw you over in storylines. The game's tone and atmosphere and writing is very... I dunno if I should say nihilistic or realistic. You can't save the day all the time. That's not the kinda game this is. And there are a lot of times where the game outright just screws you over because you lack something. Like you don't have the right race, or religion, or sub-race, or upbringing, or class, or personality type or rep. \n\nBut I mean, yeah, it's a decent story. Play it on Normal until you get fed up with the bullshit then turn it down to story mode and just enjoy the story.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is honestly rather dull. The setting is 90% bog-standard, even if the developers put some effort into creating a new universe and lore, it feels too similar to DnD. The game was based on a good idea: In a samsaric world where souls pass from one life to another, the wheel of death, rebirth and redeath has been broken and it's our job as the Dovahkiin™ to fix the cycle. Souls retain the memories of all the persons they once were for some reason, which can create psychos if a living individual start to \"remember\" its past(s). Our main character can see and interact with the souls of the living and the dead, travel through their memories, but at the cost of his sanity. Despite this good idea, somehow the developers managed to make a generic experience out of it. A shame, really. The story does a lot of basic mistakes, lot of set ups without pay offs or with shitty pay offs, it feels like the story's ambitions exceeded their level of competence. Three quarters of the dialogue choices are \"Please tell me more about X\" in different ways and a lot of the descriptions are straight walls of exposition. Roleplaying is surprisingly satisfying though, nothing revolutionary but there are options for playing very specific types of characters that would make sense in their world. Chargen and tactics have some decent depth to them, but most fights end up boiling down to \"lock down a chokepoint with your tanks and grind down the enemies with whatever combination of abilities your party have\".\nThe White March, however, is fantastic. It leans harder into the setting's less generic elements, the plot is punchier, and everything as a whole is just much more exciting and enjoyable, including the fights. Overall I'd say the game (Definitive Edition) is worth playing, but I dunno if I'll bother getting the sequel, probably not.",

        "review": "A Masterclass in CRPG Design: Pillars of Eternity Exceeds Expectations\n\nI'm thrilled to say that Pillars of Eternity is an exceptional CRPG that has exceeded my expectations in every way. As a fan of the genre, I was blown away by the game's attention to detail, depth, and complexity. From the moment I started playing, I was hooked.\n\nOne of the standout features of Pillars of Eternity is its racial passives and stats system. The ability to customize my characters with unique abilities and traits based on their race and background is incredibly engaging. The stats system is also incredibly detailed, with a wide range of attributes and skills that can be combined in countless ways to create a truly unique party.\n\nThe game's skills system is also noteworthy, with a wide range of abilities that can be combined in creative ways to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. The ability to craft my own recruits and shape them into a powerful team that synergizes together is incredibly satisfying. The tactical gameplay is also top-notch, with a focus on positioning, timing, and strategy that requires careful planning and execution.\n\nBut what really sets Pillars of Eternity apart is its story. The game's narrative is engaging and captivating, with complex characters, moral dilemmas, and a richly detailed world that draws you in. The writing is superb, with clever dialogue and a sense of humor that adds to the game's charm.\n\nThe game's visuals and sound design are also noteworthy. The graphics are stunning, with detailed environments and characters that look like they've been ripped straight from the pages of a fantasy novel. The sound effects and music are equally impressive, with a haunting soundtrack that perfectly captures the game's dark and atmospheric tone.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Pillars of Eternity to fans of CRPGs and fantasy games in general. It's a masterclass in game design, with a focus on depth, complexity, and storytelling that sets it apart from other games in the genre. If you're looking for a game that will challenge you, engage you, and leave you wanting more, look no further than Pillars of Eternity.",

Nice combat system that is different enough to stand apart from similar games, but still familiar enough to feel intuitive. Solid art and world design. Aesthetically amazing. The downside was everything else.  Personally the companions shifted between pointless to annoying and didn't leave a good mark. They seemed like a lot of work to get to know, and then when I did I didn't care.  They definitely tried, but just...meh. Spins a good mystery in the story, with your typical sinister antagonist.  What let me down the most was that the ending. It ended up being lackluster and felt unaligned with the revelations right before it.",

It's only downfall is its complexity for newcomers to the genre, but if you can read tool-tips or do a little research outside the game, it is very maneagable.",

If i had to have any gripes with the game, it would be the sorta out dated graphics, but its park of the appeal which is fine. But my main gripe is that the start is just so depressing...not a shades of grey kind either. Honestly definitely recommend this game with the sequel as it is all one fantastic story and games series.",

        "review": "Overall, though the game is not a masterpiece, it is worth playing. It is an enjoyable tribute to the original Baldur's Gate & Icewind Dale games. The world and the characters are very well done. The combat (and there is a lot of it) is kind of hit and miss. I like the combat mechanics in theory, but the difficulty scaling turns it into a bit of a slog. There are a vast number of intriguing spells and skills and items, but unfortunately, you don't get to properly appreciate them all, because for so much of the game, your enemies are either so easy you hardly need them, or else they're so hard, you get pounded into a paste before you get a chance to use them. Skillful play and judicious use of items allows you to take on harder enemies than you could fighting on autopilot, but no amount of skill is going to let you slay dragons with level 1 players clad in loincloths and armed with pointy sticks. If the enemies are much lower level than your characters, they're so easy it's annoying to have to fight them. If they're much higher than your characters, you're going to have to reload and go to some other area to level up a bit first. My advice is to take full advantage of the difficulty settings that can be adjusted in game, but keep in mind, it only affects enemies in areas you haven't yet loaded. I thoroughly enjoyed about 75% of my play through, but by the end, I just wanted to get it over with. I finished the game in story mode, which didn't make the combat fun, but at least it kept it short.",

        "review": "A decently enjoyable DnD style rpg with ALOT of story/lore/stuff to read in it. Like the Divinity series, it has multiple difficulty settings for players of all strategic skill levels. Combat is done in \"real time\" and can be paused when ever you want to have characters be repositioned or cast certain spells. Just a heads up though, there is ALOT to read/investigate, so if you dont got much patience for doing such things, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nAlso as a heads up, there is NO health healing spells or health potions in this game (you will find many and i do mean MANY, threads talking about healing this and healing that, but they are all referring to restoring endurance, NOT restoring hp/health). There is 1 health restoring talent that you can burn one of your precious talent points you get via lvling that restores 20% of a friendly characters health over 9 seconds once per fight but thats it.\n\nThere also doesint seem to be any life leech in the traditional rpg sense aka life/health/hp/what ever you wanna call it steal (again, tryed to google it, and it turns out everyone is just talking about endurance which has so many ways to be restored in this game that its not even funny).\n\nYou mainly restore health via camping/resting at an inn. Wish alot more game reviews had stated this (by this, i mean the almost complete absence of skills/items/ways to heal health other then camping/resting at an inn) for had i known before hand, i most likely wouldint have bought this and pillars 2, but it was on sale when i got it and just assumed it would have healing spells in the traditional sense and health pots, for in truth, i didint know they made ANY kind of rpg almost fully void of such things until i played Pillars and ive played MANY rpgs/types of rpgs since the days when they started to come out on the NES console and PC.\n\nStill, after having clocked in 10 hours as of this review, my whole gripe about the lack of health healing stuff aside, it is a decent game, but i do implore anyone reading this review, READ OTHER REVIEWS AS WELL! For although i havent touched on combat encounters in this review and lack the experience to talk about it at length with my limited time clocked into pillars, other reviews, both positive and negative, have stated that they can be random in difficulty, with some being ease, others being \"Omg most of my party just got pwned nearly instantly\" and some just flat out popping cc spells on your party off the bat/often.\n\nOverall, if the game is on sale, and your ok with no health restoring spells/health potions being in the game, with your real, main source of healing being resting at an inn/camping, and enjoy a game with alot of story/stuff to read, then i def recommend buying this. \n\nHonestly though, even though i am giving this game a \"Recommend\" checkmark, its really more of a \"Neutral\" check mark from me. Because, as someone that mained a healer in WoW for many years back in the mid 2000's and other other mmo's that came after, finding out 9h into the game that there is no \"healer\" in the traditional sense of the word (after the hours of reading i did in addition to my play time in this constantly thinking id get my heal spells in another lvl or so but turns out they just did'int exist) really killed a VERY large portion of my desire to play through it. Like come on, there's healing in table top DnD and in R.A salvatore's drizzt series but not in this? BAH! MEDIOCRE! (says zols in his best mad max fat, ugly, evil main dude voice)",

        "review": "Positive: Gameplay\n\nGameplay-wise this is a very faithful modern adaptation of the classic Baldur's Gate isometric formula, although it's not exactly the same. While I do feel the nostalgia as someone who invested hundreds of hours in BG 1 and 2 for the last 20 years, I can also appreciate the tweaks made from a QoL perspective. That being said, I still prefer turn-based games such as Divinity: Original Sin when it comes to combat mechanic. Other than the nostalgia factor, the only positive side I see with realtime with pause is that it allows you to go through easier combats faster and/or to focus more on your favorite characters. But then a game would need a) a good story and b) good characters, which leads me to the next section.\n\n\nNegative: Storytelling and Worldbuilding\n\nI can't recommend this game because of how awful these points are. The world is the most generic high fantasy medieval setting you can imagine, the storytelling is focused on quantity over quality in regards to the text (both in dialogues and worldbuilding), there's a constant flux of SJW cringe/hot-takes and obvious references to real-world history, namely the Cold War era. I can't get immersed in any aspect of this game's world, story or characters. The characters... Don't get me started. They're as forgettable as it gets, token shells with a clear SJW filter looming over everything. It's awful. I really can't recommend this, as I can't tolerate it any longer myself. Maybe if you're just looking for this style of gameplay and doesn't care about a good story or memorable characters.... But still. Meh. You've been warned.",

        "review": "[b]Pillars of Eternity[/b] is like a good 900-page book that you consume and savor [i]slowly[/i]. A dense and complex block of narrative and details that, through prolonged engagement, builds an intimate and enduring relationship between the reader and the universe, offering a gratifying and immersive experience that will leave you satiated and orphaned at the end, as only a good story can.\n\nFor those who hold a special appreciation for fantasy stories that don't reduce their setting to mere juvenile escapism, but rather, employ the freedom of the fantastical in a sophisticated and elegant way to explore themes unconstrained by the mundane and concrete nature of the real world, and to play with questions that inhabit the realm of human imagination and give shape and meaning to many of our beliefs and habits, this is a feast ready to be devoured.\n\nIn a standard fantasy attire, with touches of dark humor and philosophical remarks, delivered in a finely balanced manner through beautiful ornate prose and complex characters, often brimming with humanity and laden with traumatic baggage intertwined with the original lore of the world, Pillars works with the unique idea that souls, the primordial essence of all living beings, exist as a concrete fact and not merely as a philosophical abstraction.\n\nAnd thus, all the ramifications related to this subject become part of the tangible reality of the inhabitants of Eora – Reincarnations, ghosts, supernatural traces in objects and locations, and of course, gods and rituals. Many of them.\n\nThe entire story emanates from these concepts. And in the end, it will confront you with slightly unsettling questions about the ultimate purpose of faith and religion, and how it might be to live in a world with or without gods. Imaginary or not. \n\nPillars uses it's fantasy to discuss the fantastic. This is a story that demands your attention and patience, and it rewards the player who is curious (and a bit dedicated). And it will present you with interesting questions and doubts around its themes, encouraging, perhaps, one reflection or another about your own worldview.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, like any worthy narrative RPG, you're invited to actively and decisively become part of that world, to decide the course and outcomes of its dramas and conflicts. You have the opportunity to bring a part of yourself into the story and transcend your experience of playing in something more personal and meaningful.\n\nEvoking classic CRPGs of the 90s, the masters at Obsidian Software set out to make Pillars an experience familiar to fans of the genre, while also carving out its own place, as if these games had never ceased to be made and this was simply another franchise from those times, retaining and enhancing that same mechanical and narrative complexity (and making everything a bit more refined).\n\nUndoubtedly, they succeeded in this endeavor. I've never met a fan of those games who didn't feel at home here and don't admire these extremely detailed and diverse pre-rendered backgrounds, or wasn't satisfied with the whirlwind of combat micro-management, enriched by deep customization and the possibility of making explosive combos, or by the immense replayability factor that easily covers two or three full playthroughs of the game (which is already quite sizable). The irony of it all is that in this effort to resemble something older, several issues were inherited along with all the good that came with it.\n\nThe first, and most serious of the problems, are the endless loading screens, taking 5~10 seconds (perhaps more), even on a standard SSD, to load the environments. Small or large, it doesn't matter. All require loading screens.\n\nThe decision to make each house, each floor of a building, each transition within the same city, require one of these screens, always generates that wonderfully inconvenient sensation of dead time. Imagine, as I approached the end of the second act of the story, I encountered a total of 17 loading screens in less than five minutes due to back and forth travel. \n\nYes, 17. I'm not exaggerating. And i played the PS4 port first. The loads were even longer.\n\nTo be fair, it's not always so aggravated. For the majority of the game, the back and forth is sparse enough not to be too bothersome, but consider this: If a house has two floors and you need to go to the second floor to speak with someone, you have to go through 4 loading screens just to exit the house again.\n\nSome fans of this game dubbed it \"Loads of Eternity,\" alluding to this peculiar feature of the game.\n\nThe second point concerns the absurd excess of combat in the game. For those seeking an opportunity to experiment with new builds, it might work, but it's clear that the game prioritizes quantity over quality. The only reason there's so much combat in the game is because there was the same amount of combat in games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. In the end, waves and waves of enemies force you into an exhaustive and repetitive process that makes you no longer want to experiment with your likely fifty spells available. You go into automatic mode and become frustrated because the game doesn't respect the atmosphere of the locations you're exploring.\n\nIt's a complex combat. Fast and intense in micro-management. It can be tactically delightful to devise a plan and overcome a challenge that had been troubling you, but most of the time, unless you're playing on very high difficulties, the process becomes repetitive and eventually exhausting.\n\nLastly, and perhaps less important, because Pillars was a pioneer of this CRPG renaissance, it still lacks various convenient features that you find nowadays, like multiple quicksave slots or skill anticipation for build planning (fortunately, the game allows you to redistribute your points), or clearer explanations about some of the game's systems, among many other small things. If you've played games like Pathfinder: Kingmaker or Divinity: Original Sin 2, you might feel their absence.\n\nFurthermore, I emphasize that these issues are minor and don't significantly detract from the enjoyment I had with the game.  \n\nDoing a methodical exploration of map is immensely satisfying and intuitive. \n\nThe game is drenched in excellent little narratives, exploring various conflicts with dubious morality. \n\nAnd even those lore books, which serve to supplement your understanding of the world, become a direct part of the main narrative. When was the last time you saw a game ask you to learn a bit about the world in order to advance a quest?\n\nAnd you can be genuinely evil in this one. Without that crude, weak, false dichotomy presented by so many rpgs, between the genocide-man and the fantasy Jesus.\n\nIt's a very complete package and an extremely competent and well-crafted game, with a good amount of both main and optional content that's highly replayable due to customization options and a variety of outcomes. It offers a good dose of tactical combat open to experimentation, stunning art direction, writing, and music, and a series of delightful extras, like a lore book, a tactical guide, and a short story written by Chris Avellone.\n\nSeriously, even the game's name is great.\n\nIt's that kind of story that you know that every time you revisit it, you'll extract something new.\n\nIt's worth every penny. And you'll feel like you should have paid more.",

A play of lot of different games and few have ever made me stop as early because of eye strain as this one. \nI prefer Divinity Original Sin in general, as it is a similar game but somehow better executed. DOS also has a narrator say anything that isn't said by any character and uses less text to bring the point accross. \n\nI'll probably give the game another shot at some point, but I would have to be pretty bored at that time.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is probably the best entry point for anyone who wants to play a Real Time with Pause CRPG, or an Infinity Engine inspired game. The game features fairly modern quest design and QoL concessions, but also maintains the classic feel of games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. There are plenty of options to tailor the difficulty and the UI helpers to your preference.\n\nI will say that the game has a learning curve when it comes to character development and skill usage. If you are unfamiliar with CRPG design from the late 90s and early 2000s, I would recommend you look at a guide to understand the game mechanics and class system. The tutorials and tooltips do a fairly good job of explaining what each stat or ability does, but there are some game mechanics that will need some thought or explanation to fully understand.\n\nStory wise, the game is very engaging and there are a variety of companions to recruit. The quality of the writing may be a bit inconsistent, but overall the narrative accomplishes what it sets out to do. Party members also have memorable stories and most characters are interesting to get to know.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys classic CRPGs or would like to get a taste of those style of games.",

        "review": "My opinion is that nobody asked. First two acts kinda busted. Third and fourth meh. The combat system is okay, but has a lot of problems. Usually I can't even understand who and where is located on the battlefield. \n\nMost of the companion quests are okay, but mother's and durance's are kinda bad. It's said just wait for another conversation, but these dialogs is usually scripted for acts and usually starts at the beginning of them. They should script them for some actions or something other than camping at the start of the acts.\n\nNaming of places and peoples and other things are too difficult to remember. \n\nAnd the last boss is too hard. At the end of the game, there were only two types of fight. I don't even need to control anyone, or i need to sit in pause and dictate every move and buff so anyone doesn't die. And usually I stumbled on the first type. But the last boss.... He has every defence stat 100+. All of my attacks had a 5-10% hitting chance. I know that he is last in the game, but i'm playing on normal, i am not that good at crpgs, but i really enjoy it. On the second try, I just lowered diff to story mod and beat that mother`fuc`ker. \n\nAlso, in my opinion, the third act is kinda lame. I couldn't find any tavers or other kinds of points of interest. And for me, act 3 felt kinda short and hollow inside. I understand that i could just miss all that, but i think that it is the problem with the game that i couldn't find anything interesting.\n\nAnd finally, too much text, and too many difficult names. It was unreal for me to remember all that, so i just skipped maybe half of the text.\n\nIf you like to read a lot of useless text - 6/10\nIf you don't - 5/10\nI just can't to choose that i can't recomend this game, but in here i can say it. Don't buy.\nWhen this game came it was busted, but now you should play only you wanna to become acquainted with this world and then play the second game.",

        "review": "Ok so it took me a bit to decide whether I like this game or not. The reason I bought this game is I heard from a few divinity original sin players that it is a game that offers more \"interesting\" build/battle dynamics. I noted that and forgot about it lol.\n\nI recently purchased Pathfinder WOTR , prior to getting this game. Pathfinder to me was extremely overwhelming as someone completely blind to the \"rulesets of DnD\" or whatever. \n\nI got there eventually, but I found that game to be off putting from a battle mechanic perspective (to me the most important quality in a video game). The story was good and easy to engage with...but the battles felt like they are in the way, I don't actually enjoy coming across or \"overcoming\" any battles..was rushing to just finish the story. \n\nNow, I would say this game has kind of the \"opposite\" problem to me at least in the beginning. I immediately found the battle a lot more exciting. I really feel this game put effort into making that whole \"DnD ruleset\" enjoyable/palatable on a PC game, and not just copy pasta'd with no thought what would happen. \n\nThey made the classes have iconic obvious flavors from the get go, so you immediately feel you are playing the class you picked. Even though the choices are a lot \"less\" than Pathfinder. Pathfinder has -for my taste- too much jargon that mechanically is so unsatisfying and inhibiting for an RPG, and it takes you way too long to feel anything special is going on with your run or characters. Not the case here imo.\n\nThe classes in this game genuinely feel like they are different. And you feel that a lot of the talents and level up choices are meaningful, easy to understand and you can take multiple build approaches to what would you like your party to be, or what flavor twist would you like the class to have. \n\nAre all talents/spells good or well balanced...no. There is definitely some \"useless traps\", but nothing is SUPER misleading, and you don't feel like you really really should be focusing on a specific approach to a build otherwise the game is just completely not fun and a disaster, and retraining is accessible. This is in contrast what turned me off immensely of Pathfinder WOTR personally, the massive amount of misleading do nothing spells and talents.\n\nNow if you are an RPG general fan, I will warn you that this game is real time battle, not turn based at all, in Pathfinder you can pick between the two, here it is only real time. \n\nThe best way that I can think to explain it. Think if you've ever played Age of Empires, Warcraft, Starcraft, or Red Alert. You know games where you manage armies, invade, attack etc.\n \nDid you find these games enjoyable??. I personally only enjoyed Warcraft since it had a \"magic/fantasy\" element to it (not a fan of scifi/or real life games), and you had campaigns with amazing stories and characters, not just army management. \n\nThis game feels very much like that but less \"micromanage-y\" battle wise (well you are managing 6 fully abled characters though not 100s of mindless roaches) and you have an easy way to slow down/speed up/pause battles, which originally when I would watch that on stream I would feel that looks so weird and not fun as a viewer, but playing it, I love it! The game's graphics are, you know not the best, but very smooth and doesn't feel like it's consuming too much while giving questionable visual experience (Pathfinder lol).\n\nThe playstyle/mechanics/abilities I found to be very intuitive, and easy to understand, and accessing information is easy in game, menu layout and item management is easy to utilise...(I can't say the same for pathfinder tbh). To me the battles and character building is 10/10!! Love it, big fan!\n\nNow where I have \"shit to say\", is the story. Look the story is actually very interesting and \"complex\", and the characters you play with are really cool and lovable. But...in my experience I just found my self having a hard time getting sucked in into the lore, and gauging or even wanting to know \"where is this going\". This where Pathfinder definitely wins lol. In Pathfinder I was like ok and then what's gonna happen!!...this game...I struggle with that. To me it's one of those \"Thanks, I'll just watch a youtube summary about the whole thing\".\n\nNow I admit I am one of them \"I hate books\" people, and I definitely think this game is very much \"read to understand\". The voice acting is great but for whatever reason is not consistent. You get random pieces of conversation voice acted and the others not (is that a bug no idea). \n\nBut even when it is working, it's just you get a lot of \"talking talking talking but what did you say?\" situations I don't know how else to put it, I am not really an aficionado on story telling techniques. All I know is....if it wasn't for the battles I would've been gone, so the opposite of Pathfinder lol just tell me where the are things to kill please, give me the juicy hard battles!\n\nThere is a lot of lore terms and figures that get bombarded in your face...eventually I just felt like...ok...I guess I dunno. It's hard to gauge who are the \"side pieces\" of the story, who are the \"main events\", I just felt lost tbh. \n\nI am probably very spoiled with perhaps modern games, or other types of games. And frankly I never ever contemplate reading \"novels\" for entertainment, If you gift me a book it better be mainly pictures, or has a nice cover to pretend I am sophisticated when I put it somewhere people can see. It's just not my thing...and that's where I wish the game was different. But I realise that is a taste thing...just giving you my take. Plenty of people enjoy the reading aspect of games.\n\nI do think the more I replay the game the better the whole game will drill a place in my heart, including the story. Which I definitely feel this is a game I will enjoy replaying, something I can not say at all about Pathfinder personally, because lore/stories is not why I play a video game. (I keep mentioning that game cause it's the closest to this one).\n\nAnyways glad with my purchase on, got it on sale hehe.",

I missed him the first two times I tried this game, which got me rolled in the next area.\n\nMore pressing is that the game has a single isometric view. Its sometimes impossible to figure out what's happening. Neverwinter Nights released 13 years before, was completely 3D, and had no such issues.\n\nIt just feels like a game from the 90s made in 2015.\n\nI am at a point of needing a guide to figure out what to do to kill Readric. Seems I'm missing more recruits from somewhere. But I'm just not sure if its worth the bother.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is a game I’ve always wanted to jump into, enjoy an immersive story, and have fun with a classic CRPG. I grew up playing CRPGs over 20 years ago with Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale being the two I remember the most. Those games are legendary and I saw a lot of similarities between those games and Pillars of Eternity but unfortunately, this game just didn’t come close to how great those games were.\n\nThis game isn’t terrible but it isn’t extraordinary. The soundtrack is solid, the graphics are good, and the customization options for creating your main character are great. The overall art in the game, especially with the loading screens, I also thought was good. The voice acting is decent but at its core, Pillars of Eternity is simply not a fun video game.\n\nThe story at first grabbed me and I was genuinely curious to see where it would go. The problem is, after the first 5 hours or so, it got so boring that I started to dread playing this game. I originally played this back in 2020 and stopped because it got too hard and too dull for me. Fast forward almost three full years later and I remember why I stopped playing this because it’s a slogfest to get through the story, areas, dungeons, and everything else in between.\n\nUltimately, things get beyond frustrating due to the random difficulty of enemies you encounter. One moment, you are one-shotting everything and then the next, mind you, against the exact same kinds of enemies, you get destroyed and have to play again from a loaded save. It’s not balanced at all and there are no explanations as to why it’s like that because it’s all random and super annoying.\n\nBesides the difficulty, characters in my party got stuck everywhere, either against invisible walls or doorframes all the time. The combat is not fun at all since you have to pause and micromanage every single encounter and let me tell you, the “Party AI” is useless. I can’t tell you how many times I’m fighting a group of enemies and besides my main character, the rest of the part is pretty much AFK doing absolutely nothing. Again, you have to pause, click on them all, and specifically attack the enemies you want. Either this is broken or useless but it’s so frustrating to have any genuine fun or a natural flow to the game.\n\nWhen it comes to items, spells, weapons, etc., 95% of everything you loot is mostly garbage to sell. You’ll find maybe 4-8 things that are worth using and everything else is nonstop duplicates with the exact same properties. It’s terrible and when a game like this has mostly fluff you get from looting, it’s another bad sign that even this part wasn’t well thought out. When you kill a group of enemies, why have they dropped 8 one-handed axes with the exact same properties? Common now.\n\nI couldn’t finish this game fast enough because I just wanted it to be over with already. I have zero desire to do any of the White March expansions because this game is simply not fun at all. It’s an underwhelming CRPG with a hot mess for a main story.\n\nSpeaking of which, this is one of the most mundane stories I’ve ever played in a video game and I’ve been gaming for over 35 years now. It’s so bad that it’s forgettable. As I sludged through the final parts of this game just to get my Steam Achievements for at least completing it, I’m excited to move on to something better. I own and will eventually play Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire but after this experience with the original, it’ll probably be a while before I want to jump into this game’s sequel anytime soon.\n\nI give Pillars of Eternity a 2/5 and would not recommend it to those that love playing CRPGs. You’re better off playing the classics and especially the remastered or enhanced editions of them. Pillars of Eternity is flat-out boring, has combat and audio bugs (voices cutting out, delayed sounds, and it muting entirely), and the characters you meet along the way lack any personality or sense of humor. This game felt like a chore to get through and gaming is supposed to be fun, engaging, and awesome. This game is boring, tedious, and frustrating. It’s a shame, I really wanted to enjoy this but I honestly feel it’s one of those overhyped games that once you get into it and after the first few hours, you’ll see how truly bad it is.",

Also bc of the zoomed out perspective and how close characters stand to each other, it’s very difficult to tell what’s going on. Many times, I would have no idea what was going on and could only tell by looking at the health bars of my characters.\nThe other big issue is the story, I really found it confusing and uninteresting with a lot of very wordy passages that were well-written but lack personality. By contrast, I’m playing Avernum right now which has a lot of words but the story is so much more engaging. And despite having a lot of freedom in many of the side quests it didn’t feel in the overall quest I was allowed to decide anything. \n",

Where Baldur's Gate is now very old and showing it's age, Pillars has many quality of life improvements to make it feel far more modern and accessible to players. I will warn you this game is text HEAVY and will require a lot of reading if you want to enjoy the story. There are a lot of moral gray areas and choices to make. Although I don't think this is one of the best rpg's ever made, I do think it's a really good one. It's just the right length and just the right amount of content to not overstay its welcome - though I found the story not nearly as interesting as many other RPG's out there. This game did send my pc into a BSOD one time.. that was weird.. Overall I would highly recommend this to any fan of the first 2 Baldur's Gate games or any CRPG fan. This is a love letter to rpg's of old and if you haven't played something like it before - give it a try.",

Fantastic story-writing, gameplay that's difficult but alluring enough that you actually want to progress just to be able to go back and fight these harder battles, and an actually enjoyable camp-based (i.e. \"stronghold\" in this game) management minigame. \n\nThe only downside: this game isn't the most optimized. I'm rocking a Raedon RX 7900 XTX and i7-3700K yet I get on average 110-130 FPS with settings not even completely maxed out on a game that looks like it's from the last 2000s. Take this info with a grain of salt.\n\nHighly recommend if on sale, though. Get the Definitive Edition.\n",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is a RPG is eager to show off its writing and its world, while showing little regard for the impatient and for the folks who don't have a passion for reading.\nAnd the writing of PoE is brutal, by using 20 words when 8 would suffice. At its best, it is very well to convey messages and ideas, bringing characters and their philosophies to life. But at its worst, it actually undermines its own story. Sometimes when it wants to reveal essential plot points, these can easily be drowned under its own flood of dialogues and descriptions. Saying so much at once, the supposed twist is unrecognizable. Admittedly, these moments are rather rare in the entirety of the game, but they do exist, so one has to accept to be frustrated and stay faithful. Or not(later on that).\n\nThe music of the game is also quite atmospheric in the right moments, though, I wouldn't say it is somewhat recognizable outside of the game. It does its job, and delivers a pleasant experience without to disappoint, but also without leaving any impact on you for the long run.\n\nThe biggest warning I can share on this game are its technical issues-\nI am not talking about bugs(not denying there are any, but I havent really encountered any which harmed the gaming experience), no, it is the actual loading screens in the second half of the game. At a certain point, the loading screens start reaching the 20 till 30 seconds mark, and only get longer at this point(until a whole minute). Which includes the loading screens when entering a house, or just entering a closed room or another floor. It harms the experience immensely, because games like PoE live of traveling around and visiting settlements, yet when hitting the endgame, just looking around into buildings can lead to frustration because you've wasted minutes entering a room, which only houses a single nameless NPC. When I've beat the game, I learned that I missed content which I wished I've seen it for myself, but at that point, I've lost all desire to look around in the new town and just moved on, minimizing my explorations on what was necessary. \nI recommend to look for mods which might deal with that issue. I learned about those in hindsight, and wish I've added them early on in my playthrough.\n\nFor these technical issue, I'll take a whole point from the score, because even if the writing and pacing of the story has flaws(there are sections of the game, which make it unclear what exactly the main story is supposed to be), it is nonetheless a fun adventure. The gameplay works and grants many ways to overcome encounters, both on the field and in dialogues.\nIt is a very solid RPG, and I am sure, many people had fun with it, and many more will end up having fun with it. But anyone who gave up on it, because waiting for minutes to just enter a house was just too much of a slog, is justified in their ire.\n\nA very solid RPG with an equally solid fantasy world, presenting a story which utilized the setting to its fullest, even if it is overwritten at times.\nHarmed by its own tech, sadly.\nI give it a 7/10.\n(important note: When buying the game, the White March DLC is a must. In its entirety, it is a focussed miniature of the whole game, with a tighter story and improved pacing, with many great moments of mystery and adventure. Giving the vanilla game another point to the score[ie, without the DLC PoE would have ended with just 6/10 instead].)",

        "review": "This is one of these games I WANT to like, praise and recommend. But just can't.\nOverall, this game is masterfully written, well voiced and more than competently designed. It feels like a true successor of the Classical RPG Genre, and it deserves credit for how it stays true to its roots.\n\nBut...\nThere's a few things that hamper it along the way, which take away from so much of the good things that the game does. And most of it, comes in the form of the combat system, and how it is either too fast, or too slow. Too difficult, or too easy. Too simple, or too obscure.\n\nMy main gripe would be with the difficulty, which seems erratic. One moment you are one-hitting enemies that explode in gore with basic attacks. The next moment there's this strange floating nondescript blob that zaps your entire party to an inch from death, and almost can't be scratched. I understand there are mechanics, and some enemies have resistances and weaknesses etc... but the game is tremendously bad in giving you this feedback.\n\nSome other encounters are then horribly annoying with enemies just ignoring your tanks' taunts, and taking a long route, just to swarm your casters. I get that the \"Monsters know what they're doing\"-argument is sound and fair, but if the game doesn't give you the tools to crowd-control effectively, it seems kind of unfair.\n\nOther encounters just stun-lock, charm and knock-down multiple party members, making the fight ridiculously long, difficult and drawn out. When it's basically built in as a speedbump-encounter on the way to a bossfight. Ironically, said bossfight, a blind badger with a wet herring for a main weapon, could beat.\n\nAt one point, the game seems to actively prod you into the direction of fighting a pitched battle with your underlings and allies against a pretender. I gained a few more levels between then and the actual battle, using my own character and some of the NPC's that the game offers. When I fought the battle, I won by the skin of my teeth. If I had taken the battle when the game seemed to \"want\" me to fight it, I'd have had no chance of winning.\n\nThe game also does this weird thing with a lot of weapons being fairly indistinct from each other, and frankly, I find it hard to distinguish between multiple of the unique, named weapons. Which is a shame, because the game seems set to shower you in gear drops and unique, named gear.\n\nAll in all, I can't really recommend this game over some of the more modern competitors at full price. Maybe for €10?...\nAnd even then, i'd play it on the \"story mode\" or \"scenic\" difficulty, just to enjoy the story, the well-written characters and the thought-out lore-rich world.\n\nIf what I have just described is 100% your thing, then by all means, take that as an endorsement.",

The story is mind-blowingly confusing as they throw so much at you so fast and it's all text-based so if you accidentally press spacebar on accident huge portions of the story just vanish, the stronghold seemed so interesting at first until you actually try to use it, then it's kinda like 'Why did they even add this to the game, I'm never close enough to it to actually use it' No matter your security score you can lose all of your taxes to bandits so there's barely any point to even mess with the stronghold. I was literally just playing the game without any idea what was going on and then I suddenly beat the game and credits were rolling and I sat back thinking \"what? that's it?\" I was reading all the text, but I still have no idea what a watcher is or how the gods are somehow real but not real? IDK. I was just having a blast exploring things and killing everyone that even looked at me funny.\n\nIf you can get it on sale go for it, get some mods to make the classes/weapons more balanced or go with 1 pally 5 wizards and just nuke everything that moves to ash.",

Personaly i cheesed one of the hardest optional enemies.\nStory it can get really depressing but also has its moments of hope  as the game and story were progressing it was progressivly getting less depressing and more hopeful personal i love playing a good guy, As it expect you to get really into lore and the world at places and politics of it all soo unlike pathfinder kingmaker and wrath this will a bit harder getting into since it throws allot of terms  and poltics making your character act like he knows it all, but you youirself dont unless you read books, at moments i felt forced into chosing dialogue choices i didnt like when talking with companios, without understanding what i was getting myself into.\nSpeaking of companions bit disapointed i didnt get to romance any but i get it get they were going for a more heavy depressing theme in this game but still i kinda expected more, each one is unique story to go allong with them some you can effect some dont. there are those that try to make you yourself but dont listen to them its not worthy coming from the mouths of these people that had done much worse acting like they know better, some will annoy you or anger you but it is what it is, i rather help them get over themelfs even if i dont like them i want to see a happy end for them.\nI want to talk about story again, as it progressed i started enjoying myself more and more because i finally understood what was going on as it started to get more personal. idk kinda wanted to mention it.\nThe game has allot of running back and forth across mutiple maps so there is that its a bti annoying honestly probs stole most of my time.\nI like how the world interact to your actions and companions you are using.\nSome  things are a bit scuffed like the enemy placement with bunch of mobs just thrown in a pile to jump if you step into a forest. and quests at times.\nNot gonna lie i kinda cried at the end when slides started playing because even tho i hated this scuffed game at time i loved seeing atleast some of the things i did be good and character getting a happy ending after all this time was very wholesome.\nOverall i kinda enjoyed myself nothing really outstanding that made me go crazy because personaly i loved Arushe in pathfinder wrath and she herself made that game like 10./10 but this game had non of it the only non of the suprising moments the only suprise is depression and game making you roleplay your whole story wich can be good but it does pull you out of immersion at times. So no demon waifu is a big minus.\nOverall ok expiriance",

If you've heard about this game having a bland story you've been sorely mistaken, the writing is fun (and very dark) albeit a bit verbose.\n\nI enjoyed my time with this game much better than the first two Baldur's Gate games, I wish I had played this sooner. Something to note is that this game was held back by Baldur's Gate fans who wanted it and its RTWP mess yet again. To quote the director:\n[quote]Honestly, I have to say it felt like the most compromised games I worked on were Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2[...] I (had) a bunch of new ideas for how differently I would do it if I were doing it on my own[...] But they were crowdfunded games and the audience was like, 'No, we want D&D, we want exactly the same experience as the Infinity Engine games.'[/quote]\n\nExcited to start the sequel and enable turn-based mode instead of suffering more real-time with cringe.",

For me the fights are just a little vague, in the sense that you don't feel in control sometimes. its in the movement that is the issue. setting up the party to go where you want is really frustrating. The story and the game are solid though and at this point this is a classic game. revisiting with critique could be seen as unfair. i am doing a playthrough and still thoroughly enjoying it.",

I think the overwhelming pessimism makes it melodramatic and cheap.\n\nthe grieving mother is a fantastic exception to this, and i think she's an incredible party member with a criminally small part to play in the overall game. her cryptic and detached attitude actually works for the character because of the tenderness in her story. it's a breath of fresh air because it's the game FINALLY giving you a window into the tragedy of the hollowborn. you get to see how sacred a happy and healthy childbirth is in Eora and how horrible the new reality is in comparison.\n\n2. underwhelming character writing in a setting that has such interesting potential for it\n\nyou have incredible, nearly perfect empathy but 99% of the time you're using it to be the world's most mediocre detective. \"who killed this guy? which one of you is lying?\" who gives a shit!! i want to know what makes the big bad head of the crime family feel warm inside, or what small vices the strict monk secretly allows himself, or to tell the innkeep that the troublesome customer is secretly in love with him.\n\neverything is basically just convincing someone to let you help them, you go do their stupid objective, you meet someone, and you choose to spare or kill someone, and someone thanks you and apologizes and says they were wrong about you and you're actually the second coming of jesus. it gets old.\n\n3. the ai is an eldritch horror designed to give you nightmares. it cannot be trusted\n- unless you micromanage your guys they will fail to path to an enemy and just afk because they don't understand how to take a slightly longer but more open path to a destination\n- charms are stupidly strong. why does sagani instantly shoot itumaak in the head when someone casts a charm on him? why does raedric's entire court instantly cave his skull in when i cast whispers of treason on him? why does everyone swap their active weapon set and then forget what kind of weapon they're supposed to be using when the charm ends?\n- the ai changes targets too much on Aggressive, and not enough on any other setting. focusing down a caster requires babysitting all of your damage dealers no matter what because they can't be trusted with just an A-click on the enemy\n\n4. everything costs too much until you suddenly have infinite money\nyou cant afford a decent sword at the beginning, and by the end you have way more money than you could ever know what to do with because nothing you can buy is good enough to use. the only things I bought were prybars, grappling hooks, chisels, lockpicks, and camping supplies.\n\n5. the game has a \"fast mode\", but you have to walk around in slow mode (scouting) everywhere to see traps and secrets, so they cancel each other out\n\n6. party members having desynced xp is annoying\n\n7. the ui is clunky as all hell\n\n8. the audio is bugged and random sounds are cut off or way too loud\n\n9. way too many combat encounters. on normal difficulty, my party was strong enough to brute force combat without too much micromanagement in the last 10ish hours, but it was still tedious.",

        "review": "Pillars Of Eternity is an isometric RPG developed by Obsidian that takes heavy inspiration from classic RPGs, most notably the games made on the infinity engine (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment). Despite its heavy influence, Pillars is quite a different kind of game with its own identity. It doesn't use the D&D licence and thus has its own set of rules, spells, and an entirely original yet somewhat traditional feeling fantasy world. \n\nOne of this games biggest strengths but also one of its biggest weaknesses in my opinion is this game's massive amount of lore and world building. Obsidian created such a rich and huge world with this game and it does its best to try to show and explain all the elements and facets of it throughout the experience. Characters that you talk to will be constantly referencing things about the world or discussing certain things, many of which you probably don't know about or have forgotten about because it was mentioned hours ago from another dialogue with some other npc or was written in a book that you probably didn't read or just skimmed through. Due to this game's shear amount of world building it throws at you from the very beginning it is really easy to feel lost and at a certain point in the game I just didn't care any more. \n\nThe main plot itself is very interesting and the game ties the main protagonist (the player) and the main antagonist together very well. Without spoiling anything I will just say the plot is good but like the rest of this game's world building, it can get confusing and if your not paying very close attention you can lose the plot pretty easily. One main criticism of the plot I have is that the main antagonist does not appear or is even mentioned that much through the whole story. As a result, the game just feels like I am going from one location to the next with no real purpose or goal other than for the sake of exploring and meeting new people for quests. Games like Baldur's Gate and its sequel (this game's main influences) had very strong yet simple plots with clear antagonists that you either saw regularly through the story or had a main impact on the world so they were never forgotten. \n\nFor example, Sarevok in BG1 approaches the PC at the very beginning and commits a brutal act. Then what follows is the PC tracking him down by killing his personal guards one by one as they get closer to reaching the main city of Baldur's Gate. In BG2, the PC is once again faced against the antagonist at the very beginning where they must escape his dungeon. Afterwards Irenicus kidnaps one of your closest friends and tortures them while also assaulting the PC in there sleep with visions throughout the story. These are both good examples of how to have a compelling villain that the character has motivation to take down while also giving the villain a constant reminding presence in the world. \nPillars on the other hand doesn't introduce the villain in the beginning. It tries to keep the main plot and purpose of your PC vague for as long as it can get away with, which makes it really hard to care or get invested in the story at the start of the game. It's honestly hard to even recall what happens during the story or when exactly the main antagonist is introduced because the main plot is not only not very memorable but just really convoluted and hard to follow when there is so much other stuff going on in Pillars and the important story bits are only fed to you little by little throughout the game.\n\nPillars can also be overly descriptive during dialogues with npcs by having to describe everything they are doing and what they look like down to each wrinkle on their forehead. Okay maybe its not that descriptive but it does feel like a bit much and can get really graining on you after a while. This is a long game especially with the DLC and having to read through paragraph after paragraph of lore dumps or descriptions of what the npcs are doing during dialogue can get a bit boring. Sorry I hate to say it but it is true. The thing is in Planescape Torment, for example, it also had very descriptive dialogue and also a huge world and lore that it had to explain to the player, but I feel like it was done much better in that game then in Pillars. It helped that the world it was set in was so unique and otherworldly that I was just craving to read everything I could about it. Also Planescape didn't out stay its welcome. It was well paced and not an overly long experience. Planescape took me about 45-50 hours to complete while Pillars plus its 2 DLCs took me about 92 hours. So not only was I just not engrossed enough in Pillar's world like I was with Planescape, the game was way longer and felt overall very slow paced. \n\nTo wrap up this review I want to say that They did a phenomenal job with the artwork in this game and the 2D backgrounds look absolutely beautiful. The combat is also very smooth and fun but definitely doesn't have that over the top insanity that BG2 provides with its overpowered spells and awesome demonic enemies. Pillars is definitely a lot more balanced and toned down compared to Baldur's Gate and classic D&D. In conclusion I still recommend Pillars Of Eternity because I feel like the foundations of this game are really solid and the world design is amazing. The classic Obsidian and Black Isle writing is there but it is intertwined with a lot of overly descriptive flavor text that you may love or hate. This is also a true and pure Role Playing Game which is saying a lot in an era where less real RPGs are made anymore. \nI look forward to playing its sequel which I hear is even better than the first one, and also the upcoming Avowed which will take place in Eora.",

        "review": "Unmatched world-building, choice making, and story telling. Seeing Phil Spencer say the world of Eora is the future of Xbox makes me both excited and happy to see this beautiful world get the attention it deserves. Companion's are a treat but some classes are neglected which might lead you to struggle between wanting a companion who's viable VS a companion's perspective & personality. The DLC is a must and is intriguing all the way through while simultaneously offering a lot of content. \n\nIf you are more interested in a game that's lighter on story telling and more engaged with combat, I would recommend Divinity over Pillars. If you are more interested in story telling, meaningful companions, world building, and decision making, I would recommend Pillars. Both are great games with something different to offer.",

        "review": "This game has a number of story threads that could be interesting and engaging, but the writers seem to have a very limited set of quest implementation \"recipes\" and \"Surprise! Meatgrinder!\" is on the menu far too often.  This might not have been as much of a problem if the game allowed effective retreats from combat, or gave some feedback prior to the meatgrinder that there was a meatgrinder coming, or gave some indication afterward of \"Remember that meatgrinder you had to give up on four whole character levels ago?  It's now within your capability.\", but it does none of these things.  You have to blunder into the deathtrap and either die or realize you've got no chance, then load a save you made from before blundering into it and turn around with no in-character reason or explanation.  And then come back every so often to find out if you can handle it yet.\n\nI honestly don't know if the story ends in a satisfying way.  I don't know how things get resolved.  And I'm never going to, because the story isn't engaging enough, early enough, to justify continuing to get murdered repeatedly because there's no difficulty feedback and no retreat.  That's something you expect on elevated difficulty settings, on subsequent playthroughs.  It's not appropriate, it's not fun, on below-default difficulty before someone's ever seen the story.",

        "review": "A good and extremely well written game marred by schizophrenic and at times outright unfair difficulty which turns the late game and the expansions into a joyless, miserable slog. Enemies will come in vast swarms that envelop your party and hit you with endless status effects to constantly paralyse, petrify, knock down or terrify your party members, making combat confusing and incredibly annoying. I found myself playing the same obnoxious encounters over and over again, and I got through them only to have my max level party repeatedly one shot by certain bosses.  I'm not saying that the difficulty is insurmountable, I'm saying it's frustrating and tedious and that I stopped enjoying the game a good ten hours before I stopped playing. I kept hoping it would get better, but I just got more miserable, and I honestly cannot work up the motivation to actually finish. I don't think it's a bad game, the world is rich, the art is nice and the mechanics are good, but the latter half of it is such a joyless experience I couldn't finish it and I can't in good faith recommend it.",

It's entertaining, the progress seems enjoyable not just a drag, there are interesting systems in the game to keep things interesting, interesting characters and yeah, overall fun and if you can snag it on sale it's definitely worth the money. Maybe even worth the money not on sale, which is certainly not something I say a lot. Just know what you're getting into.. action point based pause and go combat, single player, traveling adventuring rpg fun.",

The stronghold mechanic felt lacklustre and unimportant. There is fun to be had, but it has many flaws holding these back.",

Every chapter was a slog, every event was underwhelming, and every fight felt sluggish and boring. \n\nI didn't care for the main story or the world-building. They were all presented in the most boring way possible. Companions felt like sheep following a shepherd; I never felt they oppose me or bring an argument worth debating. \n\nI didn't care for the gods or factions; they all seemed shoved into the world. Interacting with them was either fetch me this or kill me that. Or Find me this or solve me that. Without connecting a personal motive. \nI swear, every time I entered a city or a big place with multiple NPC's I made a gigantic sigh. This is not surprising seeing how low the percentage of completing this game is. The game isn't designed in an engaging way to incentivise the player to do quests.   \n\nBut what bugs me is the fact Obsidian created Tyranny, FNV, and SWKotOP which had an amazing story and world-building. I felt 100x more immersed and amused by them instead of POE.  \n\nFor context, I have finished both POE 1&2. Both of them have very weak narratives and sluggish pacing. And I don't understand why. POE has very interesting concepts and Ideas, yet they fail to bring any of them in an interesting way that would keep me engaged. I could have sworn that each time I was engaging in dialogue it would always be an endless amount of exposition. \n\n2/5\n\n",

        "review": "Pretty similar in game play to the Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale games and has a decent story too :)  In that one area it's not bad.  However I must warn you that this game really isn't noob friendly.  If you really want a challenge I'd would recommend it though.  This game differs from other rpgs in that character health pools are divided into health and endurance. Character's can only regain the health portion through rest and their health is 5 times a large as endurance.  When a character's endurance reaches zero they are knocked out and can't do anything until that battle is over.  This happens constantly in battles so you are forced to pause the game every 5 seconds or so in them if you want to win the tougher ones.  Also you don't always get xp from killing enemies :P.  The permanent death in this game if your health reaches zero along with being unable to heal health outside of resting or a few very limited abilities makes it a bit annoying as it forces you to rest a lot.  Iv'e noticed as Iv'e played a bit more that thankfully, enemies do seem to ignore your knocked out party members \"at least so far\".  Also try to get DR bypass weapons of 5 or better as soon as you can \"makes killing mobs so much easier :)\".  So really the difficulty with the low endurance seems to be the biggest issue Iv'e encountered.  I'm still undecided on the stronghold although I have read you can skip it if you want :)  I had a lower opinion of the game earlier but now I'm on the fence if the game is worth it.",

At its base difficulty, it can be extremely unforgiving and take a long time to learn and progress at a steady pace. Which can be its downfall as its also very story and detail rich. So while youre taking hours to grind through an area to progress a plot, you may forget key details about why youre there or the people youre helping. Playing at a lower difficulty can help keep the storys momentum alive and the details more vivid in your mind. But if you like getting your butt kicked then by all means, chose a higher difficulty",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is a weird case. It certainly gets a lot of praise, and if you enjoy old-school isometric crpgs, then it will certainly catch your eye at some point, some might even credit it with starting the current 'golden era of RPG's' we are currently living it. If this 'golden era' is happening right now it's up to debate, what is not up for the debate is that PoE is regarded by many as a new classic in the genre.\nI know a lot of people who have never seen 'The Godfather', but if I were to ask them to name me 5 'masterpieces of cinema' regardless of their personal preferences, then certainly Copolla's movie would figure in tha list. It's only natural that we are drawn to share the general consensus, after all, if everyone agrees about something, it must be true, right?\nWell, I got duped by the general consensus into thinking PoE was a great game. It's not a great game but it's certainly the corpse of one. It looks like a great game, it talks like one, it waves its hands, it might even do a little dance for you, but upon further examination all you see is the rotten flesh of a zombie.\nThe character development and scenario construction fail to captivate, as does the central conflict. Instead of immersing yourself in a vivid and engaging world, you find yourself merely observing a robotic narrative of fabricated plot. \nPoE is always trying to connect what made the good RPG's of the past great with what modern audiences would want whilist still faling for the traps of it's own making. PoE main problem is not it's combat or it's core mechanics, they are all prety serviceable and that's the problem. Nothing about it is exceptional or even note-worthy.  A game made with no passion, it seems. Everything from the mechanics, uninspired world and stats is simply forgettable.  \nThe way it just spits blatant exposition at you in EVERY single line of dialog is extremely annoying. It makes the whole game feel like like reading a wikipedia article.\n\nThis game is a complete waste of time and I regret buying it.",

        "review": "[i]Pillars of Eternity[/i] is an isometric RPG title developed by Obsidian Entertainment. You begin your journey as an ordinary member of a caravan travelling to the town of Gilded Vale, for the reasons of your choice, but this quickly changes as the unfolding events connect you to the world of spirits. Troubled with visions of a dark future and mysterious past, you set off to find the answers to a terrifying curse, only to find more questions.\n\n[b]THE GOOD[/b][list]\n[*] I’m a sucker for a good story and [i]Pillars of Eternity[/i] delivers exactly that, with the plot revolving around sinister happenings in the region of Dyrwood that cause tragic consequences for all of its denizens. While intrigues between the gods and mortals may be a common trope in RPG genre, here it’s expanded on by the lore that’s exceptionally rich and original. The story may not be the easiest to get a full grasp on, but the superb focus on lore and plot presentation makes it absolutely special. There’s also tons of extra information about the world, its history and mystical forces that drive it, for those interested in fuller immersion.\n[*] At first I was sceptical of a story DLC split into two parts, but then it turned out it was completely unfounded. Don’t be fooled by the shared title ([i]The White March[/i]) – both DLCs bring plenty of different gameplay extras. Part 1 adds a new region to explore, a storyline of an abandoned forge able to shape the world and a couple of mechanical improvements. Part 2 expands on that, as well as grants access to a couple of high-level challenges. Overall, a very strong (and long) addition, definitely worth its price. The only caveat I have is that the storyline isn’t well matched with the main game and can provide too much distraction from, you know, actually saving the world. Maybe it’s not that important after all?\n[*] There’s so much stuff to do in the game you’ll have spent dozens of hours before you’re finished. An incredible asset of Pillars of Eternity is that no quest seems unsubstantial, not even the most trivial task feels forcefully shoved into the game to artificially bloat it, and your hero always feels to exist in the middle of affairs of great importance. And some of these really are important, as your choices craft your further experience with people you meet, organisations of dubious intents and events that progress your way to an inevitable clash with the ultimate evil.\n[*] And speaking of choices, the game emphasises their significance through the system of reputation and personality traits, a multivariate approach to shaping the world’s responses to your actions. Each region and major organisation has its own view on your hero through separate reputation stats, allowing you to be the saviour and the villain at the same time, depending on your roleplaying needs. And consequences of treading your path reach beyond just that with the personality trait scores that increase purely based on your decisions. Gaining some traits open new options for resolving quests or dialoguing and may as well make some things harder if your interlocutor doesn’t fancy you being too honest or cruel.\n[*] The classes are the shining beacon of mechanical diversity of the game. Even the RPG usuals such as the warrior or the wizard aren’t just a copy-paste of what you see in an average representative of the genre, gaining multiplicity of advancement perks and options that may lean their progress towards a satisfactorily different playstyle if that’s what you want. And then you have the bard with their chants you get to craft depending on what passive boons you need at the moment, only to strike with powerful magic once you’ve sung enough, the cipher that uses psychic abilities to easily break through the enemy’s defences, or the monk whose powers rely on getting their cheeks clapped during a fight. If you’re in for somewhat expansive mechanics that at the same time aren’t overwhelming, your playthrough may get a couple of more hours spent on checking out the available options.\n[*] The stronghold is such a cool base of operations it actually needs its own point on this list. Not only you get to bring back its greatness with various upgrades, but you also get a couple of different “filler” types of content, like deciding the fates of people in the area, extra side quests for your inactive companions or getting ingredients for your alchemical shenanigans. It’s a very interesting way of expanding the game’s lore and strengthening the immersion.\n[*] A lot of thought was put into the sonic presentation of the game. The music hauntingly fills the atmosphere of events and places together with thoroughly mastered sound effects, and voice actors clearly committed to their jobs as well.\n[*] It’s a game tailored for a wide range of RPG fans out there. Whether you’re a casual player, a tactical mastermind or anyone in between, there’s enough gameplay settings for you to craft your ideal experience. Need an extra safeguard when your companion is about to die? No problem. Want to disable tooltips to seep more realism into your game? Sure thing. Feel like getting ultimately challenged? Try the Path of the Damned mode (and regret later!). Or go the other way around and explore the world (almost) freely with the Story Time difficulty.[/list]\n\n[b]THE SO-SO[/b][list]\n[*] There’s a good deal of dialogue option to choose from and some of them bear great importance and equally great consequences, but too many are hidden behind ridiculous stat requirements that feel almost unreachable at the current level of progress. Sometimes you can’t get back to the core of a discussion after picking an option that may have sounded completely neutral, like an innocent question before digging deeper into the topic. In a way it’s a method of preventing your hero from becoming an all-knowing Mary Sue – which is a good thing – but then you may be left with a feeling that they’re actually quite dumb for not having come up with an idea that seemed pretty obvious, but it’s locked behind a stat requirement. Also screw you, Resolve, for almost being a must pick in this department.\n[*] There’s many equipment options to fit into your desired playstyle and those more gifted in figuring out mechanical details may feel at home with the ability to switch weapon sets depending on the enemy’s armour type and whatnot, but to me it all lacks the oomph. There’s a couple of powerful items you need to upgrade by meeting certain conditions (which is an interesting concept), but everything else feels rather samey. It’s not entirely bad, because you don’t need to push for the greatest rewards in order to enjoy the game, but at the same time you don’t even have to look at your inventory screen after a certain point.[/list]\n\n[b]THE BAD[/b][list]\n[*] Pathfinding is just dire. The characters seem to take up more space than what’s shown on the screen, or maybe they’re just all stupid, who knows. What I definitely know, though, is that multiple encounters ended up much worse than they could have purely because my companions struggled to move their pixel bodies to designated points, even though they really shouldn’t. If there’s two tips I can give you, one is “avoid fighting in corridors, even if they seem wide enough”…\n[*] …and the other one is “practice your patience”, because that’s what’s going to be strained during loading screens. The game just loads forever. Maybe that’s the “eternity” part of the title, since I actually never figured that one out.[/list]\n\n[b]OVERALL[/b]\n[i]Pillars of Eternity[/i] takes what’s best in RPG genre and incorporates it into a unique universe. It’s packed with a really great plot, interesting events and memorable characters, as well as fun mechanics that are void of major holes. For me it was definitely more of a story-driven game than one that shines bright with its gameplay, but nonetheless it is without a doubt a worthy successor to the classics like [i]Baldur’s Gate[/i].",

The descriptions in the quests are just not good enough. I find myself constantly googling to find out where, what and how to progress or find my target.\nLoot is a bit confusing. A lot of it is the same main stats with some slightly different substats (that also change on equip?), so you don't really know what's good and what's not.\nThe writing isn't as good as the games that inspired it. You simply need to give a proper background story instead of throwing 100s of names of places, people and gods in your face and expect you to keep track of it all from the get go. I often find that i literally have no clue what people are talking about. And they do talk, a lot. Which i don't mind if i can keep up with what it is about.\nMaybe a second playthrough will help XD\n\nDespite it all it is still a solid game if you like this type of old school isometric rpg.",

        "review": "Typical indepth story, companions, lots of exploration, etc, that you would expect from Obsidian games. The only real problem with it is that it crashes. Constantly. Moving to a new map? The later into the game you get the more likely it'll crash. Trying to level up a character? Good chance it'll crash the later into the game you get. Game tries to start one of the many cutscene? The farther in you get the more likely it is to crash.\n\nIf the game was stable I'd have nothing really bad to say about it. That you can't really play for longer than a half hour without usually running into at least two crashes really makes it hard to recommend this game to other people. Only get this if you're willing to put up with that. I only stuck through it as long as I did because I wanted to actually finish it and see the ending.",

The whole game has a very somber atmosphere that you don't really see often. All of the companions tie into the main conflicts of the setting in a really interesting way, with each one showing off one aspect of why the country the game takes place in is in dissaray. \n\nIn addition, the combat in this game is pretty good. Out of all the games to use the real time with pause system (Baldur's Gate, KOTOR, Pathfinder etc.) I found that this one was the easiest to understand, something that some other games in this genre don't really do too well. If I did have one complaint it would be that by the end of the game the dungeons and areas get a little TOO heavy on enemies.\n\nOverall pretty great game, pick it up",

The world-building and story are the best part for me.\nThe characters are nice and have this adult, slight melancholic vibe to them. Eder is probably my favorite! The gameplay has this difficulty curve if you are not used to this type of game. Like for example at the start, my wizard companion character could only use his abilities TWICE before resting in a camp or going back to the town.\nHe could still attack just with a weapon, not a spell, which is kinda a wizard's whole thing... So the early game was a little tough to get through. Also, the exp system in this game is a little strange... you don't level up from battles but instead from completing quests. But it is still a magnificent experience in my opinion.",

Once I started the game and had a solid intro with the voice dialogue I was really excited to start playing.  Even the vast options for character creation were decent.  \n\nThe big downfall was the combat.  I figured it would be somewhat turn based....how i was wrong.  As soon as it did the auto pause I clicked the attack button and started the combat phase  and it just went down hill from there.  The clicking  on party members and who to attack did not work the way I thought it was going to.  With it being the starting area and already not liking the combat I knew I wasnt going to enjoy the game.",

The very limited VO, compaion interactions, and side stories feel like they're lifted right out of BG2 too.\n\nThe graphics and lack of customization in character builds was a big disappointing for me given it came out it 2015. It has way more in common with 2003's KotOR than 2018's Pathfinder game here; Even KotOR 2 had more in depth character builds.\n\nFrom the base building to the gameplay to the flaws above, they're all done much better by Pathfinder:Kingmaker, which is only 3 years more recent.",

        "review": "I'll just go ahead and say this: the game's great. So why is this a negative review?\n\nBecause I hate, HATE real time with pause option with a burning passion. I cannot stress how much I hate this mechanic. \n\nThe very nature of combat in tabletop RPGs start with an initiative roll that determines the action TURN order and you do things when it's your TURN. Every TURN has a set amount of action + movement allowance that forms your strategy. So, if I'm making an isometric RPG that has the feel of a tabletop adventure game, which combat scheme should I follow?\n\nThe answer really isn't real-time baby boo. \n\n\"Baldur's Gate did it\" isn't a valid argument either. There was a time in gaming where we didn't have f-ing mouse look, and look where we are now. Try playing Might and Magic 6 without all the modern additions and then try playing it with fan-made unofficial patches and you tell me that the classic schemes rock and we should never change anything.\n\nMaybe this is because I'm salty but look at my played time. I tried to play this game literally 5 times but every single time I have to quit because either a surprise combat or some shit starts with my characters being placed randomly (instead of following the party order that I define) or pathfinding of my companions stuck somewhere cause they cannot comprehend the apparent 200 IQ complexity way of thinking that is moving AROUND the thing standing in front of you.\n\nWhich wouldn't be a problem if I was taking turns playing the game.\n\nLook, as I said the game's good. The game's setting is really unique, the art style is phenomenal and a new setting in RPG is always appreciated. If you'd play a game with these no matter how the gameplay feels, go for it. I'll try to give it one more shot on, I don't know maybe in story mode with preferably no combat whatsoever and just play it like a walking sim or something.\n\nI don't usually have general statements for anything in gaming but I think I finally found the hill I'd die on: real time RPGs fucking sucks donkey dick. I really liked Neverwinter Nights and Icewind Dale so I don't know maybe I'm getting older for this shit or maybe it's the change in the ruleset. Whatever it is, I'm so glad games like Pathfinder and Divinity: Original Sin exist.",

It is graphically minimal, but somehow runs more poorly than the aesthetically beautiful Divinity 2, which is the superior choice if you're looking for a classic CRPG (it also has optional multiplayer). The companions are all poorly optimized and better replaced by adventurers you can create for yourself, and the story itself is bloated with boring lore that limits instead of inspires. I struggled to create characters that felt like they made sense in this world. Not to mention the constraints of classes; if you want to make any interesting builds, forget it. This game is so heavily based around a meta it leaves little room to experiment. If you're looking to have a good time, try Divinity. If you're a fun-hating masochist, this game is for you.",

This is second playthrough, and I anticipate a 3rd as a cypher.  I know sales on the second weren't outstanding, but I hope they pursue a 3rd.  Many games have faltered and come back strong.  Amazing world to build a story around!",

It's a fun game that I can easily recommend, despite never making it past the first 4 or 5 hours.",

You can really play with all kinds of different builds, classes, and comps fairly easily which was nice. \n\nI would recommend picking up on sale, maybe even at full price.  \n\nI would say, and this is kinda spoiler heavy for the end of the game, be sure to complete [b] every [/b] quest before you jump in the pit. That's the final quest for the game and you can't go back. The DLC (White March) is NOT after the game, its additional concurrent story threads you have to wrap up before you [spoiler] deal with Thaos. I didn't, and like half the game was just left unresolved. It has a final ending cinematic voice over like the beginning of every chapter and it basically just tells you \"and you forgot about all that stuff, so nothing came of it \\ they all died.\" which was kind of disappointing. There is no new game plus so you literally just lose all your progress and have to start over. [/spoiler]\n\n\nStill, its a pretty fun game, worth it for the price on sale. The rating remains the same. \n\n8\\10",

There are no banters between companions, and they seldom say anything or react to anything (either in plots or decisions i made), they are there just for the sake of 'because the main character needs companions' (except Grieving Mother perhaps, she has a complete story-arc compared to others). This irks me a lot and greatly diminishes my enjoyment .\n\nAs for the story-telling, I can see what the writer was trying to do, and it all came to a climax when I entered that cavern altar and appeased to the Gods. But this climax came too late and took too much to build (you need to read all the books concerning the Gods to fully grasp the setting and the power struggle between them). Other than that scenario, I find most of the plots just okay. Moreover, it's quite lazy to let companions 'tell their background stories' to the main character rather than 'letting the story plays itself out'  (\"Tell me about yourself\", no, this is not the kind of dialogue I want to see in games like this). But I do understand Obsidian has time concern and companion presentation may not be their priority here.\n\nCombat system is okay, UI interface is great in explaining special terms and rules, but other than that I find no particular excitement in battling.\n\nOverall, PoE has done its job decently, but it doesn't meet my expectations.",

Not only was it backed through Kickstarter, but the game is full of memorable and amazing actors that many will recognise from anime, video games, shows or movies. It's well written, and it emulates the high fantasy feel of games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale perfectly while not ripping them off. Story and lore is super interesting, you feel like you are making a direct impact on the world and people around you.",

The combat is not great.\n3.  The strongest story is about one or two of your companions, Eder and Aeloth. One struggles with the death of his god, the other is losing their mind. This is great having struggling ideas of a worshiper of a dead god is new and interesting. Having a mentally unstable companion is a good contrast of utility vs. risk of unpredictability. However, the companion stories stop there at the idea phase and don't push any boundaries of game play with these characters. Eder is never burdened by this like Boon in Fallout:NV. Aeloth never has any drawbacks to his mental issues which is now just this muted dialogue tree that presents not gameplay advantage or disadvantage. I think Neira is a good example from BG1&2EE as to a fun gamplay element to unorthodox companions with her wild magic.\n4. The main story is so muted and toothless. It has no meat as to what it's about which is talking to spirits. This ability is treated like walking on water in a world of fireballs and bear pets. It's a bit absurd to think talking to the dead is somehow beyond imagination. It doesn't push boundaries because players have talked with ghosts and ghoulies for forever. Unlike BG where your the son of the murder god and that's why you get XP from killing, or in Skyrim where you are the dragonborn and you eat dragon souls for power. This ability is kinda boring and uninteresting and the whole plot revolves around the boring thing about the after life? idk It's a stretch for me to care.",

Watch the making-of documentary and Sawyer's explanations for why the systems of the game were designed in this specific way. \n\nIt takes a while to understand Obsidian's new mechanics and buy in to the world, but once you do this undoubtedly becomes one of the greatest CRPGs ever made. The atmosphere, world-building and characters are top tier. Of course, they are tinged with a pretty noticeable American cultural hue, but this is to be expected from an american dev studio. \n\nOverall, this will be remembered as one of the greatest CRPGs ever made, not to mention single-handedly reviving the genre thereby giving us the Pathfinder series and many more.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is a tough one. There is plenty to like here - an engaging story, deep and interesting lore, fun companions... but it ends up just feeling bloated. \n\nI'll try to break down why that is. Combat is okay, nothing special, and ends up being mostly automatic when your party is high leveled. This is a problem due to the fact that there are so, so many combat encounters. By just exploring a single area, you'll end up fighting at least ten separate times. It reminds me of the pain of trying to walk through bushes in the early Pokemon games, screaming as you face your fifth hidden enemy in as many steps. Because the combat isn't terribly interesting, it just feels like bloat.\n\nThe dialogue is similar. There are certainly great pieces of writing in here, but it just feels like there's too much fluff. A lot of text is devoted to describing facial expressions, nuances in speech, and environmental descriptions that should be essentially unnecessary considering the media. While the main story beats are fun, so much of the side content and conversations just feel like padding and end up feeling like a SLOG to get through.\n\nFinally, the graphics and interface are really not great. This game is from 2015, but I don't think that's an excuse - look at the Homeworld Remastered Collection, which is also from 2015. Pillars of Eternity uses the same few character models for every NPC, has janky animations, lacks decent anti-analyzing, and is generally just not pretty. Additionally, there is a lack of character portraits and expressions, especially in side characters. All of this makes it difficult to really plant yourself in the world and connect with the characters.\n\nOverall, I would say that Pillars of Eternity is only worth playing for the hardcore CRPG fans, or those that are willing to avoid side content. I generally love Obsidian's work, and the main story and lore is up to that standard in this one, but there's a LOT of boring bloat here that's hard to ignore.",

The companions are fun and the battles can be intense, even on lower difficulties sometimes.

        "review": "A good, if a little underwhelming, successor to the old IE games like Baldur's Gate 1 + 2.  It's an upgrade in a lot of areas - graphics, rule sets, etc.  Attributes actually mean things as you can influence dialog and scripted events based on your stats, spells, skills, class, race, and disposition - if you keep choosing Benevolent options, people may recognize that etc.  I felt the scripted interactions were, if nothing else, a nice diversion.\n\nThat said, I did have issues.  There's a lot of lore dumped on you that doesn't really have an impact.  I've played the Baldur's Gate series a lot, but don't really know much about the world.  Baldur's Gate 1 basically has you start out in a town, you are attacked, told to speak to someone in an Inn, who then tell you about checking out a town down South because of some troubles and you basically pick up on things as you go on.  Pillars starts you off and immediately throws a bunch of terms and history at you - there were battles, a god was walking around, killed, etc. it was too much to take in and honestly I didn't think much had any relevance.\n\nI also see people talk about how complex 2E was and how Pillars system is more newbie friendly and as someone who's only real experience with D & D is playing the games, I can't say I agree.  In Baldur's Gate, you only really need to know that some things aren't obvious - like your defense/AC is better the lower the number (-2 is better than -1 is better than 0 is better than 1 is better than 2, etc.) which is all I ever really bothered to learn. That and knowing what spells you needed to learn to buff your team and remove buffs from the enemy. A class like the Fighter was simple - just send them to an enemy and that attack. That was pretty much it.  Classes like the Paladin had things like turn undead and some spells or unique abilities.  The most complex was the mages and knowing what spells to learn (again the buffs/debuffs).  Once you figure that out (they are old games so there's a lot of info online to help).  However, in Pillars, a fighter has all sorts of abilities and when you level, you aren't just getting proficiency points, but also talents and such which adds a complexity. Plus, abilities might only be available in combat, can be used a certain number of times per encounter or rest, or a certain number of casts.\n\nOne of the big debates is turn-based (like Divinity Original Sin games) or real time with pause (RtWP, like Pillars).  I personally just want a good game, but one of the arguments against turn based is all the trash fights and how long it takes, yet that was exactly an issue I had with Pillars - too many trash fights that take too long.  Baldur's Gate 1 has complaints of open areas with nothing in them, but I can't say that was worse than Pillars where it just seemed like enemies were placed there just to add something.  At least, in Baldur's Gate most fights were pretty quick whether it was a trash fight or a boss fight (at least if you were unprepared to fight a lich or dragon and they kill you pretty quickly).\n\nYou can control the speed of combat and it defaulted to slow which combined with an okay AI system (I used it for most fights on hard without much issue) and the ability to pause.  However, fights still got hard to follow due to the effects going around and the size of some enemies.  I also wasn't a fan of the engagement system where each character can only occupy a certain number of enemies before additional ones can move away without suffering disengagement attacks which enemies mostly seemed to ignore that and it ended up only really impacting your party.\n\nI also didn't think the companions were particularly exceptional (even fan favorite Eder) Though I was impressed by Durance given how divisive he seems to be (he is rather unpleasant and crude), but doing his quest and getting respect felt even better. I got all companions, did all their quests, and I am happy for their endings.  They just didn't grab me like those in Baldur's Gate).  I did find it annoying how Durance's quest was basically rest, exhaust his dialog until he refuses to talk anymore, rest, and repeat until you rest and get a vision.  There's one vision in Act 1 and one in Act 2 that you must see before really progressing the plot if you want to get his good ending. However, you can only do this if you rest outside (or at Caed Nua) as resting at an Inn doesn't count.\n\nSpeaking of Caed Nua, that's the stronghold you can get and while I like things like this, it felt underwhelming even compared to those in Baldur's Gate II which weren't that special.  I think I had purchased every upgrade by 20 hours and I had gotten the adventures and hirelings I wanted long before the end of the game. You have prestige and security to manage and need 30 in both for a good Caed Nua ending and 50+ Security to stop attacks.  I think I had like 3 attacks before I got 50+ Security (I do wonder if it bugged because I kept seeing complaints about the attacks?).\n\nI played on Hard which was the hardest difficulty you could get and still change it which wasn't really needed because outside maybe the first 5 levels and some of the bosses and harder content (endless paths, bounties), the game was relatively easy coming from Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 (Core difficulty).  Again, the bigger issue was the fights were numerous and just tedious to get through.\n\nI also thought the story was pretty weak until you get to Twin Elms/White March (which was like 50 hours for me doing everything) and items were pretty lackluster.  There wasn't a weapon that made me feel like I really wanted it like the Flail of Ages in Baldur's Gate II.  You didn't need any special weapons (like a +3 or better weapon to hit tougher foes) and so my gear basically remained unchanged after some time. I even stopped bothering to worrying about equipping the new stuff or enchant them (gain I found the game relatively easier overall on Hard so I felt no need though this could be different for others).\n\nIn the end, I still recommend it, but unlike Baldur's Gate where I started with I and played through the end of throne of Bhaal - clockng about 250 hours and thought of a next play through, I'm not really feeling like playing Pillars 1 again and I'm not really in a rush to play Pillars 2. I've heard it's improved, but also had worse sails (and honestly, I can see why).",

        "review": "2016 - what can I say. Newly married, newly jobless. But a host of great games that I played came out in that period - Pillars of Eternity, Total Warhammer, Darkest Dungeon, Paladins.  And I suddenly had the newfound time to play them.\n\nPillars of Eternity is a legendary game that is generally felt as being the catalyst for the revival of the cRPG genre.  Being a cRPG, the significance of hardware, frames-per-second, and so on is vastly reduced compared with other genres.  When I play a cRPG, I am expecting an experience that is akin to reading a fantasy/sci-fi novel (\"Choose Your Own Adventure\" for my fellow Gen-Xers), or akin to a tabletop gaming experience.  The latter (tabletop experience) was not a criterion for Pillars of Eternity (PoE) because to my knowledge, it is an entirely new gameplay system (that is similar to D&D, Pathfinder, but different as well).  \n\nTherefore, my main criterion for PoE was the story.  How intrigued am I by the unfolding of the storyline?  Do I want to keep playing in order to find out \"what happens next\"?  Am I touched deeply by the storyline (as I was for Dragon Age: Origins)?  Do I remember iconic NPCs in the game?  Are the choices significant?  Do they matter?  Are there multiple endings?\n\nMy secondary criterion is the game system.  As many (most) people who enjoy RPGs, I enjoy trying to develop innovative builds or novel playstyles using the game system.  I am definitely not a min/maxer - for me personally that detracts from my primary criterion (storyline);  the ability to build my party, skills, and equipment is kind of my own personal creative input into the story.  \n\nThe final criterion is the \"technical/engineering\" group - graphics, sound, ability to switch into turn-based mode, user interface, and so on.  As I had stated initially, unlike an FPS or some other genres, I don't expect to continually receive  \"dopamine hits\" as I play the game, and I don't expect some sort of immersive visual experience.  There are other genres for that.  \n\nRegarding the storyline, I liked how it developed from the start, from very humble beginnings.  But one issue that kept irking me throughout the PoE series (both PoE1 and PoE2) was the emphasis on religion and gods.  I have my own religious views in real-life, so having some sort of deity is not what I take issue with.  The part that I take issue with is the introduction of an entire pantheon of gods along with their own personality and lore.  I felt as I played the game that the entire purpose of the game was to serve a didactic goal:  to educate the player in this seminal new lore.  As a stark contrast, in Dragon Age: Origins there was no major emphasis on deities - only the notion of a \"Maker\" and interactions (sometimes very substantial) with NPCs who would discuss the \"Maker\".  The actual story for Dragon Age: Origins was based on an impending threat to the entire world, and that you as the player are tasked with saving humanity.  The \"education\" in the game was learning about the other races that occupied the world, their histories, and dealing with iconic NPCs - many of whom I'll remember the rest of my life.\n\nI didn't get that kind of feel at all from PoE.  I felt I was immersing myself in philosophical dialogues about entities and events that I had no awareness of.  It was too much most of the time to go through the dialogues where they would keep referring to events/objects/deities that I was not familiar with;  very taxing mentally.   \n\nSo the storyline - no, I did not really enjoy it.  In fact, as I played, it began to detract from my playing experience.\n\nMy second criterion is the aspect of PoE that really shined.  The gameplay mechanics were really interesting, varied, and kept me occupied in terms of how to continually improve my character and my party.   I enjoyed many of the fights, and in my recollection, I never experienced a fight that was too easy or too difficult.  I have to be honest - I never played Baldur's gate - though I started my gaming career back in 1981.  By the time Baldur's Gate had arrived, I was already starting my first jobs and simply was not engaged in computer games between 1991 - 2004.   The mechanics were really nice though of an incremental reveal of an area as the party explores it.  Additionally, highlighting important items that can be searched, interacted with, or picked up was important;  without it I would have to have internet searches continually to ensure I didn't miss out on an important aspect of the exploration.   \n\nI did have a problem with Druids because they're spells injured both friend and foe;  therefore I had to primarily use the Druid as a summoner and healer.  I felt that many of the more destructive spells were off-limits or difficult to use.  But maybe that was just my lack of knowledge of the game - but then again - maybe not.\n\nPillars of Eternity was excellent in the gameplay aspect.\n\nIn the technical aspect, it was good, I had no issues with it, and I felt like I was playing an authentic cRPG.\n\nThank you.",

But once I started to play the way the game wanted me to rather than how I wanted to, it got much more enjoyable. My most major complaint is combat is either far too easy or far too hard depending on how you go about things, there never really feels like a point where it feels what I'd call balanced. Story was very good, however my main complaint is it really wants you to know the lore of the game without allowing you a slow immersion into it. If you're not willing to read the in-game lore deeply to understand the forces at play, it's best to make your decisions moment by moment. Overall, while this game doesn't measure up to the S tier kings of the genre type games, it is a solid, well made A tier game that I'm sure I'll play again at some point.",

I don't think I've ever made it passed the halfway point of PoE because something about the writing, story, and random difficulty spikes would always make me bounce off, even when playing on the normal difficulty setting.  Maybe because my friends and I generally play homebrew campaigns for DnD and Pathfinder this game felt very, very published WotC in a bad way.  Overly self-indulgent with how it prattles on while saying very little.  So I will just chalk this up to me not being a fan of the core flavor of the game.",

        "review": "I started this game to find a substitute to Divinity Original Sins.\nEverything you want is there. But it is all poorely executed:\n\n- the combat system would be better turn-based, as in the end you just spam click the pause button to simulate a turn base game\n- characters gets stuck in invisible walls or doorframes all the time\n- the camera needs to be manually adjusted in permanance because it does not center on your team. You end up playing league of legend with your camera\n- craft exist, but is useless\n- the lore is rich. But very badly exposed\n- 50% of the already overwehlming textboxes are description of what is displayed on your screen. Here is the thing: YOU HAVE A SCREEN, YOU ALREADY SEE THAT. During the adaptation process devs forgot that the visual interface replaces the books and books of descriptions.\n- I'm 20h in, I win all my battles. But I still don't know if I play correctly\n- the storyline is uninterresting. I have no empathy toward my main characters and have no clue about his motivations. It is also hard to figure out why those randoms want to join my party\n- the environment is \"rich\" of description but nothing to interact with. Most NPCs don't talk to you, but through a spiritual power you can read 40 lines of their backstory. And then ... nothing. It serves no purpose. It feels like a museum of RPG characters created by the devellopers during their weekend playthroughs",

        "review": "If you liked Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series then this is very similar. It's played in real time with space bar pause just like they are. It has AI that you can disable like they are. The graphics are better though, it's newer that's why.\nThe spells are different than BG and IWD and take some to get use to. You can also upgrade and enchant your weapons and armor in this game.\nThe one thing I didnt like much was no real healing spells except one self heal that a few of my characters could learn so far but that spell can only be used out of combat and once per rest. There could be healing spells at higher levels, idk. It's not too bad but I do miss healing xp in battle. You can regen stamina in battle though.\nThis game focuses on camping to heal your character and you find or purchase camping gear that is used up when you use it. You can carry 6 camp icons. You can also rest at your castle for free and at inns for a fee.\nJust like BG and IWD this game is hard if you set the difficultly too high. But it has a easy level and even a story mode level for difficulty if you wish.\nSeems like a pretty long game and you won't finish it fast.",

In questo c'è anche l'unica pecca del gioco: l'atmosfera, lo spessore anche delle sidequest è mediocre per via dell'ambientazion banale (confrontata ovviamente con D&D che vanta un'elaborazione della propria ambientazione che copre decadi di lavoro e della partecipazione di scrittori professionisti).",

For some reason, a game that came out 17 years prior to this one, that INSPIRED this one, is still more user friendly than this one.Is Pillars of Eternity good? Probably.Would playing it be a hassle for anyone who can't speak fluent English? Yes.",

This game has its own system, independent from, but very much inspired by, TTRPGs, such as Dungeons & Dragons. Specifically, however, it's inspired deeply by Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.\n\nProbably the only complaint worth voicing is that there should've been some kind of class progression table, so you can actually see what's in store for your class in future levels.",

        "review": "Playing this offline on my new PC at the moment.\n\nEntertaining.\n\nTook a few hours to get used to. \n\nHad some questionable decisions regarding stat effect choices.\n\nnoting that Wizard primary stat is perception, max that out and then increase strength or intelligence based on your goals. Strength for blaster/buffs, intelligence for heavier crowd control. It's not quite that simple, but it boils down to: if you don't have the accuracy to hit the enemy, you're stuck using your wizard as a buffer in general imo. Wizards seem to remain slightly bugged in that their spells will add weapon accuracy to the attempt to hit with them (according to the tooltip).\n\nI think that First level should have been a choice between your first class ability and a talent. Mostly because a lot of those can help set the direction of a character if you have advance awareness of what abilities are available.\n\nFor a nonlinear game, the story has felt a little stifling in terms of choices having consequences so far. \n\nEx: Calisca, and the other dude, why couldn't I send them into the cave to give them a chance to survive?\n\nArmed to the teeth, the extra weapon slot talent, and deep pockets should all be a gear upgrade and not racial talents nor level talents.",

I got used to it after a few hours and replaying some parts of the game.\n\nI restarted the game twice because creating a character in this game is so complete and complex.\n\nThe art of the game is impeccable. The world, characters and especially the map.\n\nDialogues and interactions with other characters is also surreal. I imagine that the result I had in my game is totally different from someone else's. Many variables about sub races, classes and origin that I confess I felt a little lost sometimes.\n\nCombat is incredible, My main character was a paladin who caught everyone's attention while the other members of my party used different skills that could be combined and performed in infinite ways.\n\nReally the technique and strategy is very unique to each player.\n\nThe party can be composed of charismatic characters with quests about their past and personal life. Or simply composed of mercenaries that can be hired from the first city of the game.\n\nImpressive soundtrack, recording work and audio quality is excellent. Many times I paused the game to work (draw) and left the game open to listen to the full soundtrack of some scenarios.\n\nFinally, I can say that this game really had all the attention and dedication since the beginning of production. I recommend anyone who likes documentaries to watch Road To Eternity. About the dedicated people who worked on it!\n\nLooking forward to playing the second one and recommend it to anyone who has ever had any sort of interest in classic rpgs.",

The amount of in-game lore for the setting is massive, rivaling other RPG's such as Skyrim with the amount of books you can read as you explore. \n\nOne criticism you will often hear is that this game is LONG. While true, the game is very long it is also very addicting if you are a fan of the fantasy genre. The biggest negative for me is that there is no way to figure out ahead of time what build you want for your character and party members. While this was added in the sequel the lack of it in this game was a little disappointing.\n\n10/10 would recommend",

        "review": "Lovingly crafted updated 90's classic CRPG. All new IP with fantastic world building and art. Strong characters, and the original combat and magic is well done. Long load times make getting settled into a session a bit clunky, and while the combat is well designed and fun, because it is mechanically deep, positioning becomes extremely powerful. This means that a lot of combat actually hinges on the position of your characters at the beginning of the fight, as well as the utilization of doorway bottlenecks and corners; things that the AI is (understandably) unable to meaningfully approach in an immersive manner. A few combat sequences can be significantly frustrating as the scripted event repositions your team as part of a pre-combat cut-scene dialog, or spawns massive threats from nowhere on top of your backline with your tanks a million miles away. \n\nThe story and writing was strong and deep. I had no issues reading the lengthy dialog and narration carefully, and I believe this title gives the IP a fantastic foundation for future games to retun to and build upon. This is a far more sophisticated world than Tamriel or even Faerûn.\n\nI was, however, left with significant bad feels with how the endgame plot resolutions are handled. Killing the final boss terminates the playthrough permanently and feeds you a series of narrations that explain the resolution of all the interactable plot points. This ends up being highly frustrating because failing to complete side quests results in real negative narrative consequences. One cannot simply reload from before the boss encounter and go back into the world to continue your side quests because the entrance to the endgame is a one-way drop multiple maps back from the final boss fight. By the time you realize the full consequences of your decision to enter the end-game area, it has already become a massive headache to roll back your decision, and some of the narrative resolutions you get locked into are downright infuriating. The absolute worst one for me was caused directly by the natural combat difficulty of the zones. I completed White March I but planned on finishing White March II after I resolved the main quest. This turned out to be actually not possible and instead actively punished with the ultimate narrative sequence informing me that \"Despite all of the good that was achieved, your happiness did not last long as massive creatures [from White March II] came and found your keep and destroyed it and pulled it down around you. THE END.\" Nice one, Obsidian.\n\nStill, a good game, particularly for fans of Baldurs Gate 2 that want a way to revisit some of the highs of that classic experience.

However, the setting of Eora is very much its own thing - separate in many ways from the traditional fantasy worlds.  The environments feel more lived-in because of the rich lore sprinkled throughout.  It is a well thought-out setting.  \n\nStats are well-balanced in such a way that, on a reasonable difficulty level, you can distribute the stats however you want without too much of a handicap.  \n\nThe story is engaging and I found myself attached to the characters and invested in their individual outcomes.\n\nI only wish it were longer!",

I have played through PoE 4 times at the point of this review and every single time it was fun and enjoyable.\n\nThe story is great, the characters are great, the side quests are great, the mechanics are great, the DLCs (you really need both to enjoy the DLC story to its end) are great, and there's a ton of fun and challenging encounters. Not only all of that, but the character you make in PoE 1 can be imported into PoE 2, which is ALSO a fantastic CRPG that you should play.\n\nHighly recommend both PoE1 and PoE2. You don't need to play PoE1 to play PoE2, but you should. You would do yourself a disservice if you didnt and it's definitely worth it.\n\nThis is a Real Time With Pause (RTWP) game like the old Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games. It may be challenging to work with at first, but the party AI is good enough and you'll get in the rhythm of pausing when needed for the big fights and letting the characters auto-attack it out for the small ones.\n\nPlay this game if you like CRPGs. You won't regret it.",

Most characters and companions are very interesting and have very solid voice acting. \n\nThe single playthrough i did was near perfect, lots of things to like. The only negative would be the AI-management as it could get clunky at times when fighting a lot of enemies or in tiny coridors. Other then that no notable shortcomings to speak off.\n\nConclusion: A must play for anyone interested in CRPGS.",

But it's bearable honestly.\nExpansions are a mixed bag. The base game is much better in my opinion.\n\nChoices do matter and that feels great.",

In 2sec of combat the battlefield will be completely changed and I spent a lot if time  paused just to unpause and everything instantly change. At this point, I would rather just have the combat completely automated and I would just do dialog and out-of-combat movement.",

Like a intelligent barbarian or a might-based wizard. Like in so many crpg´s there are some long lore-dumps which I rarely enjoy reading and the loading screens are too long IMO. That´s about my only complaints, if I was going to list it´s strength´s it would be far longer then I care to ever do.",

But I'd have still given this game a negative review, however I don't want to affect the review scores of a an actual good studio who still wants to make good games. So I won't.\n\nIf you're an old time D&D dude and want to scratch that itch, stay away. Because their stat system is stupid. Gone are the days when Strength affected melee and intelligence, wisdom or even Charisma affected your ability damage. Now Might simply means damage, dexterity means how often you can hit, Perception how accurate those hits are. Intellect for ability range and duration. And Resolve? A useless stat in combat but very very important in dialogue. So much so that you aren't given any other options to to (heh) resolve quests.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a barbarian, wizard or a ranger. If you want to do damage, you have to go might. And then the skills? Attributes don't affect them anymore. You can make a barbarian with high lore or mechanics/stealth skills. Or you can make a wizard with high survival and athleticism. Doesn't matter. They all get equal skill points. Upto you on how you want to spend it.\n\nThis makes no sense in a CRPG. Stats wise, a wizard looks exactly the same as a barbarian. High might, high perception and medium/high level intellect. What's the point of playing other  classes? I'm still going to have use the same damn checks for conversation anyway. Instead of..oh I dunno, using Strength as a Barbarian and using Intelligence as a wizard for conversations.",

Too much word salad in the beginning as others have said. Two hours in and I still dont have a grasp on the world. Literally paragraphs where every other word is a nonsense worldbuilding term.

It's a beautifully crafted homage to those prior games - instantly playable by anyone who enjoyed them, but with nice updated visuals. It features RTWP combat, which is my ideal (I find turn-based combat to be unbearably slow, though I know many love it). Companions are genuinely interesting - with some decent banter and good voice acting - and many of them are unusual builds:  a rouge in (permanent) heavy armor,  a ranger with unremarkable dexterity, and so on, which makes utilizing them effectively an interesting challenge.  Story line is complex.  \n\nHighly recommended for anyone who likes the aforementioned games.",

I'm actually giving the story, side quests and lore the time it deserves and it is blowing me away. I am eating up the writing. Combat when difficulty is moderately high is so challenging and rewards preparation and well thought out strategy. This title treats its players like adults. Make a mistake and face the consequences. I have yet to play the second entry or the DLC, you don't have to to get more than your money's worth. You really have to be into the genre though I admit. The game takes patience. One of those games that feels like a book you'll keep in your library forever.",

        "review": "  I am gutted that I can't give a positive review for this game and regrettably, devs, the wounds were self-inflictd.\n\n  I've played Baldur's Gate trilogy from start to finish and still rate as amongst the best ever CRPG on PC, perhaps even the best.\n\n  And to be honest at the outset PoE is more of the same - to the extent that Gary Gygax (creator of Dungeons and Dragons) could have taken a litigious view of PoE's systems (although thanks to Wikipedia I note that he'd (1) left TSR and (2) died before PoE came out)   - character classes, stats, armour slots are all so close to the D&D licensed Baldur's Gate as to be indistinguishable.\n\n  However there are differences and this is where the problems arise.\n\n  Baldur's Gate had the clear cut system that spellcasters had a certain number of spells per day and had to rest to regain their spells.  This did mean that beginning magic users were fragile and weak to a ridiculous extent.  Dynaheir's role for half of the first part of Baldur's Gate was to stand at the back of the party throwing sling shots which rarely hit and didn't do much damage when they did hit whilst the rest of the party got down to the heavy business of actually killing monsters.  To compensate there was a glorious moment at the end game where she wiped out an entire army of undead with a single fireball spell but that was a long time later.\n\n  PoE instead has a rule that spells can be cast only \"once per encounter\".  What's an encounter ?  Eleven hours in I couldn't provide you with a sound definition which makes economising on spell use tricky.\n\n  The worst change however was adding Endurance and then having basic heal spells cure only Endurance not health.  The only way to restore health is to restore at an inn (If you've done the right thing there's an accessible and free inn - for basic care from the start of the game) or use limited camping supplies which can be purchased at a modest price from the inn. \n\n  The problem is after the introductory prologue enemy get tougher and deal significant amounts of damage.  Certain encounters are lethal.  You're left therefore to \"cheese\" your way through the game - encounter one set of monsters where you literally use every spell in your books, run back to the inn, heal up, start again.  And this isn't fun...\n\n   I'm guessing later in the game both spells and abilities start to restore health as well as endurance because otherwise the reviews should be far worse.  But this was an unnecessary modification and one that generally shouldn't have been introduced.\n\nS.x.",

Just an all around classic experience brought up to date feel to the game. \n\nTips for new players:\nFamiliarize yourself with the priest spells that remove Crowd Control effects (Generally starts with \"Prayer Against\"). Some of the most crippling combats are when the bad guys snag your allies and turn them against you. \n\nUse them tooltips! Nearly everything can be hovered over and have a tool tip pop up explaining why or what something is. Helps you get used to the rules behind the screen.",

There are so many complicated mechanics in place, all the time, that make this a technical marvel, but you really have to know what you're doing in order to be successful. If you're starting out with CRPG's, are a casual player, or haven't yet stomped Sarevok, I would probably recommend starting a character, running through the first couple scenarios until you unlock Caed Nua, and then restarting from the beginning with a build that's maximized for your play-style. I didn't cover all the bases, and as a result I missed out on a lot of options in the early gameplay hours. Plus, I have to play a LOT of catch-up just to be able to handle the challenges as they arise.\n\nGreat game, VERY engaging, and will likely keep you busy for 100+ hours (if you're going trial-and-error all the way through like I am).  Can't wait to play the sequel too.",

It's trying so hard to be original and unique, it spams you with long pages of lore and made-up words, that it doesn't even stop to wonder if it should be doing it. There's so much flavor that is meaningless, and none of it is interesting or gripping. \nAll the dialogs feel dry, and all the drama feels strangely detached, manufactured. Game has so many concepts that it pours out on you all at once, that you are quickly lost in the word salad, bland characters and bland lore. \n\nThe plot hook, also just doesn't feel all that interesting. It's just detached, cold, it tries to be like the intro of the Baldurs Gate, but instead of your step-father, it tries to grip you with death of some randos you just met. And instead of menace that was Sarevok (admittedly conanthebarbarian-esque) you just see some guy that doesn't even try to kill you directly, he's just there, doing something unrelated. And this weak, soggy beginning just carries through the game as it goes. You just end up places, doing things, and none of it seems to matter.\n\nI sort of like the combat, and I like the graphic style. It feels nice, but all in all, I hope coming forward people who make crpgs realize, that more text isn't necessarily better, if you have no strong idea behind it.",

Its fun, engagening for a casuall player. And when I later replayed it on Path of the Damed difficulty as solo it was a challenging experience that forced me to abuse the game rules at every turn. Its a really really fun game that I wholeheartedly recomend for all classic RPG enthusiasts.",

As I eventually learned what the game is and how it tells me its story it became quite tedious for me. A mixture of too many facts, too many regions, names, wars, gods with no feeling of relevance. \nHard to explain, but it felt pretty shallow and then I got some bad game play mechanics on top of it (castle management for example). \n\nWhy do games that have almost no story at all, feel more fun to play, than this? I can only make theories about that.. maybe a badly written/told story is worse than letting people make their own story in their mind (in the sense of less is more)? \n\nThe castle system personally triggered me. I do not often say something like this, but this was so painful to me. What a wasted potential this is. Kingdom Come Deliverance, for example, does this better. You feel a connection to the place, you personally recruit the people for it, care about its development, not only for yourself or your personal gain, but also for the people that live there. Here it is just letters in a logbook. This cannot be the product, that the developers thought of.\n\nOf course \"bad\" is not a good statement about someones work, more appealing would be: it is just not for me. \nThere are worse games out there, but definitely better ones too.",

The RPG rules system is basically the store brand version of Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition, with almost every ability refreshing after a rest...which are doled out by a resource you can only carry 8 of.  The end result is that the game motivates you to play it in the most, boring repetitive way possible, only using your cool abilities when you have no choice.\n\nThey fixed this for the sequel.  It is leagues better than this game.  Skip this one and go straight to Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire.",

So if you die, you have to go thru the entire ordeal again. It's like the devs never really bother doing any play testing\n- The writing is so long-winded that it feels like the writers were trying too hard. Half the crap doesn't even make sense. \n- This game tried to horn in on the Baldur's Gate fame but it's a poor imitation. Baldur's Gate was the gold standard; this is, at best, a Yugo.",

        "review": "Gra książka.\nIlości tekstu są astronomiczne z ogromną ilością dobrze zaprojektowanego lore. Mam tylko parę problemów.\n\nA więc jedna sprawa tyczy się ilości, a raczej temu co jej towarzyszy. Otóż ja potrzebuje coś więcej niż sam tekst. Znamienita większość czytania to prawie że zupełna cisza bądź dźwięk bijących dzwonów. Dajcie mi muzykę, dźwięki lasu i miasta która się wyróżnia bo inaczej to czytanie prędzej czy później według mnie zacznie męczyć każdego.\nDrugi problem jest po stronie graficznej a dokładnie mówiąc podczas walki. Prawie nic nie widać. Ze względu na styl graficzny na tych przykładowo 5x5 cm na ekranie może znajdować się równocześnie 3 a może i nawet 6 postaci. Po prostu nie wiesz która postać jest twoja bo ich nie da się rozróżnić. \nKolejny (według mnie) problem to balans. Robiłem wszystkie questy jak tylko mogłem. I spotkałem się z sytuacjami gdzie biłem głową w mur. Nie raz czułem się zmuszony zmniejszyć poziom trudności by móc grać dalej (ale to też może być po prostu moja nieogarnięta natura), po za tym zmęczeniem gdy na koniec gry już nawet zostawiłem questy nieskończone iż chciałem już ją skończyć.\n\nZa to mamy całą grupę towarzyszy od (nie aż tak typowego) weterana wojny po...jakąś kobietę której nie mam pojęcia jak ją opisać bez spoilerów by wskazać jak szeroki wachlarz towarzyszy się tu znajduje.\nPostęp postaci jest dość prosty i nie daje wielkiej swobody, ta swoboda znajduje się natomiast w wyborach podczas gry. Aczkolwiek nie jestem pewien czy konsekwencje i wybory z zadań pobocznych mają jakiś wpływ na główną fabułę. \nDubbing prawie nie istnieje. Nawet w dialogach głównej fabuły często 1/30 jest mówiona (język angielski, nie sprawdzałem czy jest polski dubbing) a reszta jak wcześniej wspomniałem to czytelniana głusza. \nDochodząc do muzyki jestem lekko zawiedziony. Były momenty gdzie jest przyjemna ale w większości o niej zapominam, i nawet nie zauważam. \n\nZe strony technicznej nie dawała mi problemów.\nDla tych którzy uważają to za ważne, gra odbywa się w pełni w trybie czasu rzeczywistego z pauzą.\n\nPolecam bo pomimo paru niedociągnięć jest solidnym RPG-iem. A jak do tej pory POE2 poprawiła większość problemów jakie POE1 posiada.  \n \nJako że już święta i niedługo nowy rok:\nWesołych świąt i nowego roku.\nMerry Christmas and happy new year\nFröhliches Weinachten und einen guten neuen Jahr",

If you are patient and want to get into it, its all there. \n\nStory is a little all over the place, lots of made up names with little exposition etc, and really just \"I dont like this I want to stop it\" as your main motivation, but lots of others seem to think its insane and driven, I am just not that super super blown away by it, but nevertheless, having a great time building a party and getting things done. \n",

Skill abilities feel sapped of fun because they're so damn hard to read and don't really feel impactful in gameplay. I think I was mostly okay with these shortcomings because Obsidian tried uber hard to make the most RPG RPG.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back for me were the loading screens. The maps are so small and even small buildings are usually made up of at least 2 or more maps. To simply get a rested bonus for your party, you have to sit through 6 loading screens... Why...? How was this not a major complaint even in 2015? It took me 62 hours to beat the game because I'm a partial completionist and masochist.\n\nThe plot also wasn't that interesting. I'm not going to say anything about it because it's a huge part of the game and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who is totally okay with sitting through lots of long loading screens. This is not normally a major issue, but this is an RPG and that's kind of a big deal.",

I have to read ALL FUCKING DAY at work, don't make me read your shit-tastic trope-stuffed story line.\n\nStop going ALL IN on GFX, for a scene that I'm going to look at once, maybe twice!  It's a smegging 40 GIGs of \"Load-Once\" Scenery.  ( and it's not JUST OBSIDIAN who does this bullshit! )\n\nYes, it's pretty, but the combat is so HORRENDOUS, with gawd-awful balancing, and encounter-spam every 2 and a half METERS!  You simply will not notice the scenery. \n\nKinda takes the adventure of the unknown and kicks it straight in the nut-sack.   Generic Non-Infringing-Monster X on grid-cell Y.  Oh no, how ever will I figure that out?!?  Much Adventure! Such WoW. \n\nLiterally all you do is: walk a few feet, get attacked, cast all spells, rest, and re-peat...until you want to hold a pillow over Peat's head until the kicking stops!  FML. \n\nObsidian, your devs are fucking lazy, and milking the company by producing lazy-trope-ridden-meme-stock.  Is your creative director a literal rock?  Because a troll (fictional) would be an actual better choice. \n\nHonestly, I cannot wait until AI takes over game-creation, because at least it will be more creative and original than this over paid lot of desk-muppets. \n\nApparently, Obsidian (and other devs of CRPGs lately) have about as much creativity, as an anti-helmet biker, post road-coitus.  So, only slightly more imaginative than a Larian dev.\n\nIt's not ALL crap, tho; got a couple things right. \n\n1. FF button: Now I can speed run through that pretty load-once scene.\n2. Group Stash: They give you a lot of loot in-game and don't punish you for grabbing it.\n3. Linux Native Build:  Thanks for that. \n4. Very few forced scenes: Nearly everything is skippable, even the rest scene. \n5. Wide variety of choices for party: Not forced to have the same 6 lame tropey dnd Larians in your party every fucking time. \n6. Not in perpetual Early-Access: An actual complete product, for what it's worth. \n\n",

        "review": "An astoundingly mediocre game. Pillars of Eternity is almost never bad, but just as rarely is it good. From a foundation of generic fantasy, the game presents some interesting ideas here and there and has decent writing throughout, but it ultimately drowns in its sheer repetitiveness and breadth.\n\nEvery quest follows the same template: receive a task. Learn that the situation is more complicated than initially presented. Make a choice on how to resolve the matter -- often a genuinely difficult choice with no clear right answer. This is great! Then you do it so many times that it turns hollow. I was utterly sick of side quests by the end of Pillars of Eternity, which I recognize is partially my fault for refusing to turn away from them, but I wanted to give the game a fair shake by experiencing as much of its writing as possible. It's not bad, it's just... okay, and overabundant.\n\nCombat is where the real problems begin. It's not uncommon for CRPGs to go down as all-time classics despite abhorrent battle systems, and Pillars fares better than many of its predecessors in this regard. It has solid, intricate real-time-with-pause combat that gives you plenty of tactical options. Unfortunately, the game commits the other cardinal CRPG combat sin: having waaaay to much of it. There are an insane number of battles in Pillars of Eternity, and it's a shame that only a tiny handful of them are especially interesting. This game loves to throw trash mobs at you, over and over again, seemingly for the simple reason that this is a dungeon crawler and it wouldn't be right if it didn't toss an army of slimes at you every 10 feet. What's most bizarre is that Pillars sharply limits combat EXP per enemy type and has non-respawning enemies. It baffles me that the developers manually placed all combat encounters, created systems that disincentivize solving every problem with violence, then saturated the world with meaningless encounters. A significant portion of my fatigue with Pillars of Eternity can be attributed to its combat.\n\nThe White March dlcs are the final nail in the coffin. They're horrifically overstuffed, bloated trudges that act as microcosms of all Pillar's worst instinct. Side quests are packed together in tiny zones. It's a bad sign when the vampire clan I was sent to destroy and the completely unrelated local ogre encampment are so close together they probably share a street address. I was utterly bored of the White March by the halfway point of part 1. When part 2 unveiled its main enemy type as easy-to-disable damage sponges that took an eternity to kill while posing very little threat, my disappointment gave way to disgust. The White March may have damaged my appreciation for Pillars of Eternity more than any other part of the game.\n\nLastly, I want to give a special call-out to the walking. Exploring new areas was always fun, but when I had to trek across them again? Dear god, no other game is more deserving of a 5x speed toggle. A minor problem to be sure, but after ~85 hours of gameplay I would have killed for faster walking. I never want to trek from Caed Nua's gate to its keep again. And yes, I'm aware of the fast forward option. I used it constantly when revisiting explored areas, and it is not enough.\n\nVisually, the game is fine. It looks great for an 8 year-old CRPG, although it sometimes does a poor job of conveying the interesting parts of its environment. Am I spoiled by Elden Ring, or is it bad when something as striking as a gigantic elm tree wrapped around an ancient ruined tower is barely visible? Perhaps we've simply come a long way in tree-based video game visuals since. The aesthetic in general does nothing for me, however. It's incredibly generic even when it looks good.\n\nSo that's Pillars of Eternity, a game that could have been great if it was 30 or 40 hours shorter. I guess it's not surprising that a game which is credited with resurrecting a dead genre played things safe. I'm not shocked that plenty of people enjoy it, and I hear that the sequel was a drastic improvement, but I have no energy for it after completing an exhaustive and exhausting playthrough. If anything, Pillars of Eternity works best as a measuring stick. Is a CRPG worse than PoE? It's a bad game. Is a CRPG better than PoE? It's a good game. But as it stands, I would not recommend it to anyone but hardcore genre enthusiasts.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is a worthy heir to the classic CRPG genre. It offers an adventure that feels epic yet personal, a host of well-written, multifaceted party members, and a broad, immersive world to explore. This game is one of the best available for role-playing in the conventional sense, as its many conversations and questlines offer a wide variety of compelling options for developing your character's personality and establishing their place in the world.\n\nThe two most common complaints levelled at Pillars is the lore density and the real-time-with-pause combat system, but I feel these criticisms are unfair. The lore is rather dense, but if you pay attention and ask questions you'll pick up the history and culture of the world fairly quickly without any particular need for consulting any external resources, as some claim. And ultimately, the well-developed lore of Pillars's world plays in its favour, as the unique flavour of its metaphysics and geopolitics more than compensates for the initial blandness of its generic fantasy presentation. The combat, another sticking point, is another place your mileage may vary. Players who enjoy finding build synergies and approaching combat with a slower, more strategy-oriented approach will probably enjoy the depth of its systems, but players who wish to ignore these systems will probably find it a bit clumsy and unengaging. \n\nOne criticism that's pretty objective, unfortunately, is that the game is poorly optimised and will likely struggle with stuttering and framerate drops even on powerful systems, especially towards the endgame for some reason.\n\nDespite its roughness around the edges, Pillars of Eternity is a real gem that will suck in any fan of the CRPG genre and stick with them for a long time after the credits roll. If you're looking to embark on a grand adventure, to get to know a party of dependable friends, to immerse yourself fully in an expansive fantasy world and uncover its ancient secrets, then look no further.",

        "review": "Even though this is a recommended review, this game is not for everyone. It's a very slow game and definitely kept more of the table top RPG elements than modifying them to make a better PC game like DOS2. And some design choices didn't help either, I guess some game mechanics strengthened the roll play element, but at the same time lengthened the game time unnecessarily. Especially in the form of increased loading screens, you better have an SSD for this game, otherwise the time you have to wait for loading screens will really test your patience.\n\nNow up to the good stuff for RPG fans. The environment of the game and the background lore setup is quite good, probably further enhanced by the exceptionally well done writting. The voice acting when present is very good, it makes each character unique and lively. Sadly probably only half of the conversation has voice acting. The character building and combat is beyond most PC RPG games. The system is rather complicated and will take you hours to do research on them online to fully understand, or if you'd prefer to play around yourself, it will just take even longer. However, building a right character can be very rewarding, the power curve till the end of the game is very satisfying. On top of all that, the classes are quite unique as well, there are more interesting ones of course, but the number of unique interesting classes are enough for multiple playthroughs. Personally I found the story interesting, it's not the best story in game history and have loopholes here and there, but I never felt bored to want to stop playing. On the other hand, the side stories are really well done, or in some way there are no side stories in this game. Even though some quests are marked as side quests, it just means it's not tightly related to the main event. Since you only gain exp from quest, you probably will end up doing a lot of the side quests just to get enough exp to level up to proceed in the main story. That's why I say there are no side quest like a normal game as you are kind of required to do a decent amount of them. The good news is they are really well done, so it's a fair trade off. Just don't expect to ignore everything and only focus on the main quest, it's almost not viable and you are probably missing a lot of the better stories in the game. It's a old game but I feel the graphics has held up well. It's not anything special in today's standard but it doesn't look too bad. \n\nAll in all, for RPG fans it's definitely a game worth checking out. Even though the options you make can't really affect the events too much, it does still has enough effect to make you feel immersive. It's probably not as well optimized for PC games as DOS2, but it's probably more roll play and D&D like than it for more hardcore fans. \n\nP.S. Through my almost 50 hrs game time, hasn't encountered a single bug, so in that perspective, it's really well optimized for PC. So don't worry about that part.",

        "review": "To sum up what will probably be a longer review, this is a very good CRPG to sink your teeth into if you're craving that sort of thing, with good writing and unique (but still firmly comfortable in it's fantasy genre) world building.\n\nFirstly, this game very much wears its inspirations on its sleeve, while not being overly tied to them. In some of its advertising it specifically mentions games it's emulating/drawing inspiration from. I haven't played all of those games (yet), but it takes those classic isometric CRPGs and builds a solid modern game out of them.\n\nTo me, the main story, especially the final act of the game, is very reminiscent of Planescape: Torment. It handles that mixture of grand metaphysical concepts, with deep personal stakes quite well. Not nearly as well as Planescape does, but better than one might expect. \n\nTo expand on the quality of writing for a few paragraphs, it's solid all around. No quest is a faceless fetch-quest, there's at least a small story with everything (which i hugely appreciate). The main quest is quite interesting and makes your character feel rounded, despite having to be the changing amorphous blob all \"make-your-own\" characters in these games have to be. The DLC was surprisingly chunky, so much so it took me out of the main game for a while and i had to re-adjust.\n\nThe lore and setting in this game is...well, it's not anything special honestly. However, I *really* enjoyed it. It's very standard fantasy but it's been crafted and tweaked to give an honest attempt at standing out from the crowd. It's history, religions, world, technology level I find compelling. I particularly like the godlike and orlans. The godlike being your genasi/tiefling equivalent. And the orlans being a more unique take on halflings/gnomes. It all feels lovingly crafted. The most unique element by far is the concept of souls and animancy (the study and use of souls). This is central to the world and story and is really what makes this game stand out. You play as a \"Watcher\" someone who's developed the ability to interact/see souls, which provides some opportunity for some really unique stories and gameplay. Funnily, I feel as though it's a bit underdeveloped for such a central concept to the game. I found myself asking a lot of questions about it and not really always finding consistent answers. It's not a huge issue (hardly even necessarily an issue), but is something you might find wondering about, as i did. To be fair, I wouldn't ask these questions about how the magic in this game works, as it's an expected trope - perhaps I should be treating animancy in the same way.\n\nThe companions are all (at the least) mildly interesting and have definite personalities. You'll have ones you like and don't like, but they're all well-handled and contribute to conversations in interesting/funny/meaningful ways. It seems some of them got more love than others, but all are unique. There's that banter and intrigue from the companions you always want from this sort of game. It's the main appeal of party-based games, I'd argue. You get 6 in a party, including yourself, which feels a good number (although you'll have to swap out if you want to do all their associated companion quests). There's definitely reason to replay, make different choices, party up with different characters and see their reactions and those consequences. \n\nDialogue in this game is something i was extremely happy with, mostly. I think having an option to see how much meta-game information you see is such an excellent idea, and one i wish more games implemented. There is a bit of fussing you can do with buffs and stats to get dialogue options to work. There's a lot of variation on how you can go about talking to people. On top of of stat-based options, there's also reputation-based options, which they did an excellent job with. What i felt they did a lesser job with was background/class/race dialogue options - they are there, don't get me wrong, but i expected more. Places where i expected to have something to say as either a druid/godlike just didn't have an option often (this might be better with other options, but for me it was sometimes lacking). Resolve is a bit of a funny stat, and is the most used dialogue-stat as your sort of charisma equivalent. So having low resolve makes it harder to generally convince people of things. By the end of the game i could buff myself to 20 resolve (the max of any stat you'll need in dialogue) from 10, with a bit of effort. But at that point, a little late for most of the quests. I don't think that all is an issue, necessarily, but it is something I had mixed feelings on.\n\nThat gets into the next thing I find need to comment on in this game, stats. It handles them differently to most RPGs. Some feel much more important than others, but there's still uses for everything. There's a bit of an nontraditional approach to how they all work. They all affect some sort of combat stat and give you the option to use them in dialogue. I found them a bit awkward in the start, but grew to actually quite enjoy how they were implemented. Might is used for both physical *and* magical damage (as well as healing capability), which i still find straaaange. I mean, it works, but yeah, a choice was made there.\n\nI really like the classes in this game. They're all designed impressively well. I played the druid, which is usually snubbed in most games, but got some real love here. It's the proper jack-of-all trades with melee (Shapeshift) combat, elemental magic, and heal/buff magic. The other classes are all fairly unique and have their different systems implemented. Combat is pretty good, even if it is RTWP - it's designed around that and you get used to it. There are a lot of spells in this game, and if you have multiple spell casters in your party it gets a bit overwhelming remembering everything you have. I was constantly forgetting where/what buffs/debuffs/cures my cleric had. The customising element is pretty solid as well, with talents/stats/skills all giving a good depth to levelling. \n\nI don't have any major strifes with this game. I suppose the backer content and stories and characters are annoying, but easily ignored. I was confused by their addition, as it's not explained what they are, and I assumed a lot of characters just had backstories I could see as a \"Watcher\". \nEdit: I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT. The fucking load times in this game are not great, and get very annoying. I Have no idea why they are as bad as they are.\n\nOverall, give it a go, as per my above recommendation. I'm looking forward to when I get around to the second game and seeing where the Watcher's story goes next AND AVOWED, whenever that's released.",

The game does involve a lot of reading which may not be for everyone, but for those looking for the old-school RPG experience in a more modern interface with high replayability I say look no further. The fact that this game was created through kickstarter just makes it an even more incredible achievement and a testament to a game style that has clearly stood the test of time.",

Very often there are situations, that my main tank (in formation in front of everyone) is lagging behind and then I encounter enemy appearing from fog of war and moving past characters disables and my tank is stuck in backline. Overall locations are very narrow and very often there are some obstacles that are invisible but cannot be passed, so my rogue is going all around to get to the enemy or because of the narrowes of the location, he is standing behind whole fight because he cannot pass that doorway (blocked by other characters and enemies).\nAlso: when your backline is targeted and instead of moving everyone back one-by-one you try to move few charactes at once, they go all over the place, often straight towards enemy that you try to run away (because of that stupid formation moving mentioned before).\n\nDomination effect is TERRIBLE, nothing better when your tank is being dominated and all enemies go straight to all other characters.\n\nProgression of characters is slow and honestly very dull. After like level 4 all classes gets basically the same skills/talents/spells so there is not much to choose.\n\nI am also not enjoying uses per rest talents/spells. Because it was my 1st playthrough I never knew what is waiting next, so I was saving those skills.",

Combat has a grant pace that can make you critically think and challenge you the player.\n\nHowever it is very text heavy while having only a few lines voiced, this was especially apparent after a certain court room scene where the pace slows down. White March helps this but i eventually got burnt out of the main game and even skipped White March part 2 (which i hear was great) just to finish the game. Before that courtroom moment the game really hooked me.\n\nMy other gripe is that you wont know what abilities you can get in later levels until you reach said levels, making inconvenient on planning you builds ahead of time.\n\nThere is a massive amount of choices for character, class, and builds that will give you tons of customization for you and your companions. But this might overwhelm the more casual gamer.\n\nI recommend this to gamers that like to read, love great world building, and don't mind the occasional info dump.",

        "review": "Just like many others before me, I absolutely recommend this game! It captures the spirit of Baldur's Gate like no other game I've played.\n\nI do think its a bit overhyped. Don't get me wrong, this game is a great experience for all who love party-based classical rpgs in the style of Baldur's Gate. At the same time though, it does have its shortcomings that you may not expect given the fantastic receptions from press and players alike.\n\nSo first things first: \nthe good stuff:\n[list]\n[*]the classes: they feel distinct from one another, some more unique arche types, like Cipher (a resource-building-resource spending class with lots of damage and utility potential) as well as plenty of the familiar classes we all know from D&D (like Fighter, Mage, Priest, etc.)\npersonal bonus: they have a Druid and (s)he is a lot of fun!\n[*] the story: the main story of the base game and its 2 DLCs is really well made, has a lot of depths and care.\n[*] the world: they acomplished to create their own lore, not a ripoff on somebody else's IP and as a player you're drawn into it and its many inhabitants, its races and views of the people in it\n[*] freedom of choice: you're not locked into creating a rogue to get all the doors unlocked or traps disarmed. you can choose to play without a character that has access to these tools (you're often given keys from carefully exploring), or simply create a Ranger, Cipher or even a Wizard with access to trap disarmament and lock picking\n[*] there are also many helpful tips in the beginning to get you started on the base mechanics of the game\n[*] the improvement felt in the DLC content. For me, the areas outside of cities felt pretty barren in the base game. There was only one major encounter per map, mostly for a single quest and other than that there was nothing worth noting happening in a single region. This was quite a disappointment. But they improved immensly in the DLC areas. The areas a larger, and more events and encounter are present on a given map. It didn't felt barren but exciting to explore.\n[*] an extra positive point, as this is where many RPGs fail: the story of the DLCs is really good. Not as good as the main story of the base game but really well made.\n[/list]\n\nand now the bad or less good stuff:\n[list]\n[*]crafting: its a bit lack luster. you can craft potions, food and scrolls. I never did any of those, you simply get enough from looting and exploring, unless you play on hardest difficulty I guess\n[*]graphics: this is one area where you feel that its an indie title the most. Its a game from 2015, but if you compare it to other titles of its time, it is apparent that this game is a not a high budget production. The Witcher 3 has phenomenal graphics, and even Larian Games' party-rpg Divinity Original Sin 1 from 2013 (and polished in 2015) looks better.\n[*] the way DLC content is being handled: you absolutely have to play it before you complete the main story of the base game. There is no way around it. At least the devs gave you a pre-end save, so you can go back and play DLC content, if you didn't before finishing the main story of the base game. But if you can't play anymore after viewing the end credits. The game doesn't throw you into the world again after this point. This is poorly handled in my opinion.\n[*] the side quests: they feel forgettable, and just not really interesting. A bit similar to general questing in MMOs.\n[*] the health/endurance system. It felt awkward in the beginning, and it still felt awkward in the end. When you're in combat and you loose life, your endurance gets lowered. But once out of combat, your life is measured in health. You can't restore health with healing spells, only endurance. So you can only restore endurance. And the lost endurance is striped from your health at the end of combat. I see that this system has its advantages, but to me it was an inconvienence during the game.\n[/list]\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, even though there are some downsides. Overall, it was a really good experience I recommend others to share! \nAnd given all of its improvements over the course of its development, I am looking forward to play Pillars of Eternity 2!",

        "review": "Very traditional, this game does capture that old school CRPG vibe, but does make it it's own thing with the way classes and lore is done. The lore when you finally understand it is very rich. Story quests can be very fun and lead to interesting moral quandaries of what your character would do. Combat can be a bit chaotic, but above all once you learn weakness and ways to buff, things become way easier. \n\nOne complaint I have is how terms are thrown at you and you are expected to know them. When I first played this was very off putting and I didn't realise that one of the Gods was actually a God until like very late into the game. Some companion stories are also very dialogue heavy and so it can be hard to follow or remember what was going on and what it all meant. \n\nStill, an enjoyable game with lots of ways to play and interact with the world.",

The world crafting is exceptional, with unique races and character builds that allow for real choices that change the world around you. So they say. Some of this is right: the world building and character creation is exceptional. I didn't get far enough to know what kind of effect my choices had on the world. All the stuff I hated derailed my play-through. I absolutely hated the game play. \n\nBeing an isometric game, it would have taken a lot for me to love the game. Sure, I have played lots of these games. But most of them don't have such poor pathing. Getting anywhere involves weaving your way through confusing pathways. At least in forest areas. \n\nBattles involve a lot of tedious micromanaging if you want to have a chance at victory. Worst, not all battles will earn you xp. This alone breaks the game for me. If you stumble into a group of lower-level enemies, you will waste resources  but get no xp. It seems like I was always running into these groups. \n\nObsidian is known for their writing. Could this save the game? Not for me. All the endless scrolls of writing belonged in a bad fantasy book, not a bad fantasy game. By far the worst writing came from all the random individuals who inhabited the world. Evidently the developers rewarded early supporters by having their fantasy stories shared through random npcs. If you love fan fiction, or fantasy fiction written by high school students, these stories will thrill you. For the rest of us, they are offensively bad. Prostituting quality for cash is shameful.\n\nBut who cares what I think. Obsidian good, Obsidian no wrong do. Obsidian good game make. Wrong. Game no fun. Game tedious. Game no buy.",

If you liked those games, you will love this. While not a Dungeons and Dragons game/ruleset, PoE uses a familiar isometric top down look like those classics and adds its own lore, lands, ruleset, magic, and mechanics to weave one of the best role playing games around. Tons of content and great interaction with different endings truly allowing you to play how you want while keeping it grounded with that old school feel. Josh and company created an amazing game that you would cheat yourself if you didn't allow yourself to try it, especially if you loved the Black Isle and Black Isle inspired games. Grab yourself an ale, light a pipe of good pipe weed, and sit down and enjoy the interesting and unique story, lore, and characters this fantastic RPG offers.",

        "review": "I strongly recommend this game. The pros and cons are best to express why I recommend it:\n\nPROS\n - In the grand tradition of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc. A grand CRPG adventure with roleplay and monsters and loot. Go from Lvl1 to Lvl16 with the expansion.\n - The game is beautiful: Very beautiful with a toned-down colour palette that pleases the eyes.\n - The music is excellent. When the battle starts, OMG! the music is epic. It is orchestral and makes your adventures memorable. The main theme is sad and I thus associate sadness with this game (as was intended, I think)\n - You can customise your entire party or hire companions or both. I recruited my own Barbarian and Rogue because I wanted to but still did all the companion quests. The system works very well.\n - Your stash has infinite capacity and is accessible at all times. Compare that with Dragon Age Origins or Baldur's Gate where you had to run back and forth between the dungeon and the town vendor. This is a very nice quality of life improvement.\n - The world is open so you can go where you want, when you want.\n - There are many quests, enough to suit your desires.\n - The world is credible with its inhabitants, its lore, the companions, the gods, the towns, etc.\n - It is well written.\n - The voice acting is great.\n - There is a ton of loot for every party member.\n - You have a keep that you use as HQ, which you can improve, defend and spend time there for bonuses.\n - The game-engine is fabulous: crisp, precise, things are explained on tool-tips.\n - Hover on top of statistics to see the detail of their calculations.\n\nCONS\n - You must enjoy reading. You don't have to read 100% of the stuff (like I didn't read the in-game books) but most of the plot is delivered to you via text.\n - I would've taken a few more dungeons (Durlag's Tower (from BG1) is still the best dungeon IMO)\n - The Loading screens are long and they happen every time you change locations, which can happen often.\n\nThat's it! There's very little bad to say about this game. If you enjoyed Baldur's Gate I or II, Icewind Dale I or II, Ruins of Myth Drannor or the Temple of Elemental Evil (all similar titles), this one won't disappoint. It is better than many similar titles that preceded it.\n\nAlso, it is similar to Tyranny, which I also recommend and to Pathfinder: Kingmaker, once again recommended by me!",

        "review": "I have played more than 100 hours of the game and I can say I do recommend this game to others IF you like CRPGS, reading, and dense, story-driven gameplay.\n\nFirst off, let me get through the bad - it's a slow burn, a slow startup, and you don't start feeling the rewards until after you're well into the first act. After acquiring your stronghold, moving onto ACT II the game picks up steam. By then you should be fully invested in the lore, the sidequests, the NPC quests, and looting.\n\nThe battle system is a bit tricky to get into and will turn you off if you're just used to defense being defense, attack being attack. See, there's about 4 defenses in this game with 3 attack modules. Enemies have different attacks and defenses and learning about which does which can be a chore most times. You can bully your team on a singular enemy, but when there's a mob you;ll need to have knowledge of the system so you won't spam reload.\n\nThe good: The story. I am enjoying this tale of cat and mouse as much as I can and never imagined playing this game to completion. The lore is rich and full of wander, but it's nothing compared to the choice driven narrative where you feel your actions have consequences. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand nor does it suggest which decisions you make affects the overall state of the world, finding out only after you've made your choices - much like real life.  The game offers multiple difficulties you can try out depending on what kind of game you're expecting. For me, I play on normal since the game is already a slowburn as is and I didn't need threats being amped up for an already hard game. \n\nThe music feels very John Williams and ushers you into the action, I'll say it feels like you're on the battlefield issuing commands and trying to survive attacks. Traveling is also not as labourious since you have fast mode which speeds up the gameplay to help you cover distances.\n\nThe characters are welcoming - though I didn't feel much for them in the beginning because of how generic they were at first, it wasn't until the meat of the storytelling kicked in that I crew to care about these misfits. Aloth will always be a charm and so is Hiravias. \n\nI recommend this game at 8/10.",

You wont be spoon fed the story, and it requires some digging, reading, and patience. But the end result is a legitimately iconic fantasy setting and RPG. The game creators of Pillars of Eternity spoke about the aim of creating a \"traditional\" and somewhat familiar fantasy world to scratch a nostalgia itch for Balder's Gate fans. In my view, beyond the classic, elves, dwarves, magic tropes, this game is in its own unique class. Big fan. Kudos to all who made this possible.",

        "review": "I've tried to get into this one multiple times. On paper a classic CRPG, it sounds like it would be right up my alley. However, I found the RPG system rather strange to get to grips with, and the initial forays into the world felt rather rudderless and filled with spiky pitfalls. In time I might have worked past those things, those are very much issues of familarity, but before I could reach that point of familiarity I kept finding myself unable to find the desire to stay engaged. It's a small thing really, objectively speaking.. the backer NPCs. \n\nThey are just so frequently and jarringly implemented, starting quite near the beginning of the game. It may have only taken a straw to break the back of my desire to play but they are anvils. Just littering many locations that you must travel through, sometimes sprinkled among actually proper NPCs that actually exist in the world, there are these special gold-plated NPCs with fancy names. Click on one and you may be treated to a surreal 'Original Character Do Not Steal' backstory, generally filled with fanfiction-grade tropes and stereotypes. Even once I learned to just never click on them, I just could just feel them there, archives of other fictions written generally quite poorly (it only takes one hack writer among a dozen to leave a bad impression), as I tried to search about towns and taverns for quests.\n\nHonestly they're just on my mind because I booted up the game again recently due to some lying Redditor saying there was an option in the settings to just turn them off. There isn't. There are some mods, actually a series of mods that would be required to be installed from outside steam, that slightly reduce the jarring nature of these kickstarter NPCs, but I can't find the enthusiasm to track them down, install them, make sure they're working, etc, just to make a game I didn't really enjoy a little more tolerable. \n\nIn the end this is just another critical darling game that simply didn't capture me, but for my two cents I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I don't think the gaming world is any longer so starved for classic CRPGs that we have to keep something like this on a pedestal. It's good that they helped bring back the genre, but that doesn't mean I'd recommend playing it.",

Об этом 16 сентября сообщает РИА Новости.\n\nПо информации издания «Юга.ру», конфликт между 26-летним и 28-летним мужчинами произошел примерно в полночь 14 сентября. Они встретились в ларьке после празднования Дня города и разговорились о Канте. Спор перерос в драку, а затем младший мужчина достал травматический пистолет «Оса» и выстрелил оппоненту в голову.\n\nПосле инцидента стрелок скрылся, однако вскоре полицейские его разыскали. Пистолет изъят.\n\nПотерпевший находится в больнице. Его жизни ничто не угрожает, однако вред, нанесенный его здоровью, расценивается как тяжкий. Уголовное дело возбуждено по соответствующей статье УК РФ.",

The companions are all enjoyable, some more than others, but all have unique quests and should be acquired at least once to experience them. Only a portion of the game is voice acted, so there is a lot of reading but I don't find it detracts from the game. The beginning of the game will bomb you with lore and words that don't make much sense. It took me a while before I really started to understand what was going on, this is after all a totally unique world that Obsidian have created. Good selection of classes and races with a few new twists thrown in, decent character customisation. The story is good, I found myself interested from the start and wanting to progress to know more. It's structured in a way that you can progress at your own pace, there is no ticking clock or countdown that you have to follow. You can do side quests/bounties etc without having to worry about the main story. \nOverall it's become one of my favourite games to play.",

Admittedly, none of them were deal breakers on their own.\n\nI'll start with the most immediate: the visual style is rather tiring on the eyes. It's beautiful but it has very sharp color gradients. If you often get eye strain from games this is probably going to be an issue.\n\nThe game is poorly optimized, though not critically so. If you are running it on a lower end or older laptop it will continuously drain over 30% of the CPU, even in the start menu, and for me it would cause a massive racket from my laptop's ventilation, severely hindering immersion. In my opinion for an isometric game with no physics, this shouldn't be acceptable. I am guessing it's so demanding because it's actually running as a full 3D Unity game with an isometric camera, who knows. Besides that it has other weird optimization issues: it takes 20 to 30 seconds to go from area to area, presumably because it has no ahead-of-time loading. It also has a tendency to lag in the level-up menu.\n\nI personally didn't find the combat *that* enjoyable. A weird quirk is that for most spells the game limits how many times a character may cast them per rest. You can rest anywhere with camping supplies, but the amount of those you can carry is limited and tied to difficulty. This made me anxious to use those spells much at all, in case I might need them later, especially since you can't really estimate when you'll get to restock on those camping supplies. Some may point out that the camping supplies are pretty common and worse case you can buy them at an inn, but if that's true what is the point of this mechanic anyway? If this was meant to be a punishment by having to backtrack to an inn, why is the number of camping supplies tied to difficulty, implying they constitute a test of skill? Besides this specific quirk, the combat was ok. I especially appreciate that every stat is clearly explained when you hover over it.\n\nThe lore of the game was interesting and the dialog was well written and voice-acted. It also has a bestiary which explained the nature of specific enemies, like the various types of ghouls, which I found interesting.\n\nI hate that the game auto-saves at every new area and there's no way to turn that off. If you want to only keep meaningful saves you have to constantly delete auto-saves, cumbersome.\n\nWeirdly I constantly dreaded having to level up because the game showers you with spells and abilities to choose from, causing, at least for me, massive choice overload.\n\nOverall I don't massively dislike this game, but it didn't really meet my expectations.

The art style is amazing; the gameplay is fun and the combat is satisfying. Only real issue I have with the game is that it is not multiplayer, so I cannot play with friends (which does kinda suck. Especially considering other games of the same genre, for example D:OS2, have a multiplayer feature).\n\nI'd never really played CRPGs as a kid, but this game makes me want to play them all! Such a great time!",

        "review": "Finally got around to playing PoE several years after buying it on Steam. The point-and-click gameplay is very good. The graphics are still good, and the GUI is clear and easy to navigate. Sound and music in PoE is better than I expected. The game runs smoothly however as I progressed, I occasionally experienced choppiness in the audio during the second half of the game.\n\nThe story is good in the sense that it is mature, however I would say it is forgettable because the way it's told is not entirely interesting. While I liked 3 of the companions, I took a strong dislike to 3 others. I found the script-writing to be incredibly dull and their backstories were in general, good but not always with a sense of completion. By the time I had reached halfway through the game I was keen to see the game finished and didn't feel compelled to know how it ended - I just wanted it to end. Without a romance option for these characters either, there is again, little onus to continue wanting to know about their verbose history. The heavy intake of text based story too, drove me to NOT want to know more, but simply have it be done with.\n\nThe world your party exists in is generally believable but limits to very basic NPC conversation alongside heavy and reiterative discussions about the world's gods. You will find yourself a bit lost and at the mercy of the religiosity and without being able to interface with these gods, they are characters without features that you only read about. In terms of other selectable NPC's, the world is loaded with kickstarter funded NPC's that ultimately have no point to conversing with unless you again desire to download each characters history/memories/backstory that serve no real purpose. \n\nMy biggest gripe, apart from the story, is with the spells in game. I just didn't find many of them useful for the scenarios presented. Some spellcasters had spells that I thought were for the most part, not terribly effective. I found myself reading descriptions of spells frequently and pondering what the point of casting those spells was - many went untested and untried with no compulsion to use them - the cleric is guilty of this, whereas he druid was an exception to this, finding he and the mage are useful for crowd control and support. \n\nNow, my primary was a moon Godlike cypher. However with insufficient 'focus' (ie.magical stamina), this build comes off neutered in battle - but it seems the choice most new players may opt for because it's different. It felt however, a mistake to use the cypher and it would perhaps be a case of trial and error to find the best build to capitalise on this type. \n\nI liked in-game mechanics such as camping,and the mechanics of the inventory. However, how stats would stack (ie the higher of two stats would be the only relevant stat rather than both stats adding together) really sucked and I found i couldn't always get a satisfactory assortment of items to equip on companions or myself. \n\nIn terms of having little helpers follow you around, that is cute, but ultimately useless as they don't really do anything. Enemies are varied and keep you on your toes. You will constantly find that positioning and targetting however, rather than spell-use, can be the difference between a won or lost battle. \n\nI did not proceed with buying White March expansion DLC because I felt I had enough of the core game, didn't like its over-verbose and dull storyline and was happy it was finished with. \n\nOverall, where this 'wins' in comparison against the ever popular Baldur's Gate 2 would be its visuals, GUI and inventory management. These aspects of it are well done. Where it ultimately cannot match it is its story delivery, interesting interactions with companions, and the tactics or strategies needed in a battle. Sometimes brevity of dialogue and mystery works better than loads of text revealing an encyclopaedia of information about a character's history.\n\nHowever, while I enjoyed this game better than the first Divinity Original Sin, overall I give it an 'it's OK' rating and therefore have to say I don't recommend it above better competition. I have found myself far more invested and enjoying Tyranny. If you want a fun isometric RPG and do not plan on getting PoE 2, then I would recommend you buy Tyranny instead. Or get PoE and PoE 2 if they're on sale only and you're in the mood to get invested in a great deal of text consumption with less interesting characters.",

        "review": "The game has a bug that has been ongoing since the beta.2022 as of this post and it still exists. Going all the way back to perhaps 2013. This bug makes some aspects of the game not work properly such as taking over 5 minutes to load character portraits on character creation. There are ways to mitigate it but for most part, none of which I have tried has had any favorable outcome. However, I have managed to get the base game to play without the audio going all over the place or have the stutter/freeze when opening inventory.\n\nDespite that bug, the game is actually good in my opinion. I had it on gog a long time ago and never played it on steam. Decided recently to do so. Probably have 100+ hours in it from days of old. For it's time, it was actually good. On par with others such as Tyranny. If you like games such as Icewind Dale or Baldur's gate series, this is a good choice. Story isn't say as good as perhaps with Planescape Torment, but is decent enough to keep a person enthralled.\n\nWanted to give this a solid thumbs down but changed my mind after playing it again a bit. All I can say is,the game was enjoyable to me and still can be. For you, if you want that little bit of nostalgia from games of old but can't get them to work on modern hardware, this is a decent substitution despite the bug.",

        "review": "Although I have grown old and cynical over the years, therefor generally disliking most of the high fantasy worlds I have previously loved as a child and adolescent, I did enjoy the world of Pillars of Eternity enough to see it through. I am much more of a sci-fi person nowadays, so Torment: Tides of Numenera impressed me way way more than Pillars did. It was worse in every other aspect, but in terms of its world and atmosphere it was just light years ahead. A complete matter of taste though.\n\nAs with any Obsidian game, you know you will get top tier quality top to bottom. Mechanics, gameplay, story, world building. No stone remains unturned and everything has a rhyme and rhythm to it, something you only get from veteran studios with experience and passion. Characters are likable and have reasonable motives and expectations, they’re interesting, the stories of side quests and main quests are great, combat mechanics are great, the world is great. Everything these people touch will turn into gold, absolutely no question about it. \n\nSo if you don’t mind the very conservative high fantasy setting, this is obviously a must play.\n",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity, to me, feels like a very thoughtful refinement of the classic Infinity Engine games it takes inspiration from. Whenever anyone tries to fix something old, however, they usually create new problems in the process.\n\nAlthough it is a truly fantastic game, Pillars feels almost like an amalgamation of different eras and ideas. Baldur’s Gate is clearly the core inspiration and it serves as the foundation for what Obsidian would build, and what they would build atop it offers many technical improvements and generational updates - this is probably the best Real-Time with Pause combat has ever been in a CRPG (bar PoE2), but some aspects like the player base and fall a little flat.\n\nThe only true issue I truly have with Pillars is that I only truly understood what was going on in the story starting at Act 3. The first two acts were spent chasing vague clues because of an event that occurs at the start of the game, which itself I thought almost too convenient.\n\nIt still manages to redeem itself, though, because when it finally clicked with me then it retroactively made the first two acts better. Everything up to that point made complete sense - what at first seemed convenient then seemed logical.\n\nAt first I felt like the worldbuilding and lore was laid on a little thick, but then I began to appreciate it, and the direction that the game goes really requires it to have its own world. Eora is fantastic, and it's worth learning about.\n\nAnd if you see people leaving negative reviews because of the so called ‘Backer NPCs’, just know that they really don’t matter. It’s flavour text written by Kickstarter backers and presumably edited by the game’s writers, and I have no idea how someone could consider it immersion-breaking since it helps make the world feel more alive. and many of the stories are really great.\n\nThere are many great companions, the soundtrack feels very Icewind Dale-esque, the story behind the plot is phenomenal, the world is vast but not overwhelming, and for the first time I actually played a CRPG on Hard on my first attempt and didn’t regret it  - the challenge just made it more fun.\n\nThat is to say, I love it. Please check out the second game as well as this one.",

My son recently started playing and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.",

This comes with very little warning from the Dozens, a good warning from the Knights, and idk how well you're warned by the Domeneneneels (or however you spell it). Just by accepting this quest you're permanently enemied to all other factions for the rest of the game. There is no way to back out of the quest once accepted. Naturally like a fool I accepted a second faction quest from the Dozens with the vague warning that it might annoy the Crucible Knights, but I accepted and was then unable to back out after they told me what the quest would have me doing. I did not anticipate the game to lock me out of the other factions by the second quest. \n\nOtherwise the games been a damn delight. I'm just really mad about this one bad design choice.",

        "review": "Its hard to put into words just how board I was with this game. The major issue being that I just have no idea what my overall goal is. Like I know because I started playing the sequel first and then came back since the two games seemed very interconnected. But if I hadn't done that I would have no idea what my overall goal is here.\nThe game starts and you're on your way to this new land that's offering cheap land and you're allowed to role play why you want a fresh start, right before your group is attacked and you're forced to flee with two other group members. One being a barbarian girl and the other being a warrior, which complimented my chosen class of wizard very well. You go through a tutorial dungeon that was so small I actively thought I had missed something inside it because I breezed through it. During this I learned about the barbarian girls sister and the reason she came to this land and agreed to be our guide and how it's all important and how I could relate to my own- Oh she's dead. They both are. Yeah it kills both of your party right after the tutorial dungeon and then sends you out into the world. Which being a wizard, a very squishy class, seemed like a terrible idea. Clearly they weren't expecting you to play wizard because as I stumbled my way to the first town what was the first actual companion they gave me? A wizard. Fucking hell.\nAfter that the game takes a massive nose dive. It became clear that I wasn't here to settle down and build a new life but the game didn't really provide a new goal for me to work towards. It just kind of went \"Bam! You're a watcher now!\" which the game fucking bombards you with an NPC telling you all about watchers in very explicit and yet veg ways. And then just kind of went \"Only you can figure out whats going on with the hollow born children\" which I already know! You showed me the evil guy doing the evil thing right out of the tutorial dungeon to the big egg. But the game just kind of sends you out into the world at that point. So I went in the only direction that really seemed available to me, which was east, and then met a dude who told me that the castle was super defended and that I shouldn't go that way. So I went that way assuming that this was setting up an end game location that I'd need to visit later. No, actually that was the way you were suppose to go. So as my second actual quest in this game I did a raid on the lord of this place's keep, talked to his generals who told me a lot of stuff I had no context for, then killed him and replaced him with his cousin. This was all in hour 4 of the game. So castle cleared, local lord killed, chaos left in my wake, I ventured forth to... I honestly had no idea. Next on my bumbling destructive journey I met a priest who was a dick, joined my party, and then immediately died. I could have save scumed to keep him alive, but I had zero attachment to him so I continued on where I thought the plot would start: Caed Nua\nTurns out no, not really. Instead I meet the former watcher of this place and he's insane and of no use. And this is when the game introduces the vaguest reason for my character to not leave and never come back (which is kind of an important quality for role playing): You might. Might. Go crazy. Which doesn't seem like that big of an issue since my wizard companion also knows about his previous life and isn't going immediately crazy. Honestly the way I read it it seems more like the series of lives this guy lived weren't compatible and that's what drove him crazy and it didn't seem like that was an imminent threat for my character. So I killed him, took over the keep and got no new direction. So I went to the only city on the map and found a new companion who was a ranger, so combined with the guy I got at Caed Nua I now had a party consisting of 4 ranged characters and 1 melee character, so my combat turned into throwing my one melee guy into combat well the rest sat in the back doing volley fire at the enemy which was pretty boring. After acquiring this new companion I step into the city and that completed act 1. How was that an act? I stumbled around for about 6 hours, stabbing up the first person who was slightly important with little idea what I was doing or where I was going.\nIt was at that point I just decided to open up a walkthrough and used that for the next few hours of gameplay. At about the 14 hour point I realised I was just doing what the walkthrough said and had no real investment in what I was doing. I just wasn't having fun, I was barely following what was happening and at that point why am I still playing?",

Story-Mode it is. You want the maximum challange, having to retry certain hard fights over and over again for finally defeating the enemy with the last breath? Harder modes deliver.\n\nAwesome game!",

I recommend going on normal or easy mode and you will flow so much more easier through this game then me. I started on hard trying to get the achievement but I couldn't. Hard mode made me lose interest in the game itself and I couldn't progress at all for years. That is until I started playing a month from now in August where I changed the difficulty to normal and I could finally play again. I then had to go to easy cause even normal was hard at times. But overall the story was actually rich and the world was rich with history and things going on. I love how many choices you make affect so many things. They even reach into Pillars of Eternity 2 Deadfire. \n\nOverall I really liked this game after changing to normal and easy modes. Was way less frustrating and enjoyable.",

But more than that, its a whole universe of very well written characters and lore, backed by beautiful landscapes. Countless hours on a single play-through this game is nothing but impressive. Fair warning though, it gets pretty dark at times.\n\nCombat is real-time with pause and slo-mo, there's also fast-mode as well if you want to die faster, sometimes fast-mode can kill you when you're out of combat too. Class, ability, equipment, item and enemy variety is HUGE! You could spend days coming up with new builds and strategies, and there's a ton of cheese built in as well. People solo this game idk how tf you do that. Easy they say, fuck you I say. There's a LOT of combat in this game and it begs to be replayed, you could come up with a dozen different challenge runs in a few minutes!\n\nOutside of combat the game offers you a lot of meaningful variety, Stealth mechanics are exceptionally polished, and you can talk your way out of almost any situation if you got the reputation and/or skills for it. There's often multiple paths to both a peaceful and murderous resolution, and the game does a fantastic job of making you feel the consequences of your actions, both in the long and short-term, and always surprisingly fairly. It really gets you invested in the world and role-playing, helped out by the fantastic soundtrack.\n\nIf you have the patience for it, this is one of the greatest RPGs of all time! You should definitely play it. The sequel is also very very good.\n\n\n11/10\n\n\n*You must be able to read.",

        "review": "cRPG fans beware and think twice.\n\nI like cRPGs and after finishing a trilogy run of Baldurs Gate I felt it was time to finally come back and give PoE another shot. This review is as much for future me as it is for a few buyer, so that I can look back at this and go \"Ah ha\" at why I ever didn't finish what otherwise seems like a good game. I'm just going to list out cons, as the pros are readily apparent, but what might kill the game for a lot of people is hidden deeper than what a trailer might suggest.\n\nCons\n\nCharacters\n1. Immersion breaking kickstarter backer content shoved directly in your face at every step, which then leads io a revelation that if it were not for the kickstarter goal NPC inserts the game would be almost dead and devoid of actual people to talk to. After walking into a tavern upon arrival to the first big city area of the game reminisce of Baldurs Gate or other similar hubs, I'm greeted with about 12 characters scattered around with interesting names and gold plates.  You can't actually talk to them. Click them and you get to read a short story which is unrelated to the plot and not written by the games creators. They got rid of this in PoE2, but the fact that they still exist here and you can't turn them off is horrible choice and not helping the brand of this series since people will likely want to play the series from the beginning. They totally take you out of immersion and therefore are even worse than generic commoner/thief/warrior npcs. At least when you talk to those, they might actually say something relevant to the game they are in, or speak of something ACTUALLY happening in town. Absolutely inexcusable. The knife in the heart of this game. I shouldn't find more kickstarter NPCs than do real people in any given area. This happens in many of the \"populated\" areas!\n\nStory\n2. I'm sure the story ends up getting good towards the end, but I can not sit through the flood of lore dumping that this game considers a \"conversation.\" More is not always better, and this game's writing is a great example of that. When it's not lore dumping at you, you're having conversations with a lot of words referring to (boring) places, people and concepts that the game somehow expects you to be familiar with already. NPCs in this game do not talk like regular people. Your companions are fine, though from what I got from them, they were still lacking, and suffered from the problem of talking about things that I have no idea or context for despite the lore dumping, and asking me to help them do things I don't understand the relevance of and doing very little to make you actually care about them until much later in. The fact that you can make your own party of generic, storyless NPCs at any Inn is a good measure of how important those characters are to the plot/game. I applaud anyone who does their own world building and create an original setting, but that's not the problem. The problem is the absolutely poorly written characters and dialogue, and the heavy focus on dreamlike sequences and esoteric concepts. I LOVE esoteric concepts, but I also like playing a cRPG with good characters and storyline. This game, despite being very well written, is very poorly written. It's like having a hi-tech superweapon in your hands and being tasked with shooting a single target, and instead they just spray wildly and hit everything but the one thing they needed to. They spend 500 words in a section that would have been much better with 100 that got to the point. \n\nGameplay\n3. The gameplay is decent enough but nothing to write home about at a surface level. My issue with it can be summed up in a couple examples. There are lots of abilities and spells in the game. At first you might think wow, that's a lot of diversity, and they are all original and different. Nope. There are a lot of fancy names for things, but they all come down to doing the same thing with different names. Very little is unique in this game, very little will actually illicate dopamine with their use. The fighting is just a means to an end, and if you're expecting magic to blow your socks off, you are in for a real dissapointment. There was little I found to be interesting, besides a few Cipher abilities that make sure of a beam gimmick. Otherwise it's just DnD spells with their power and lore nerfed for balance.\n\nThe game wants you to play it a certain way, from the gameplay, to the story. This is the illusion of a crpg. It pains me to say this, because the game does a lot right, but not nearly enough to overcome the many many many many bad ideas that I can only blame on the project manager and writer.\n\nSome may like this game, but it is by no means for everyone and it is NOT a successor to Baldurs Gate. \n\nIt's not the best, it's not the worst. It's just dissapointing.",

I felt myself struggling to appreciate the story and characters. There were interesting aspects to the classes, and plenty of unique ways to play them, but the gameplay just didn't do it justice (the skills just feel so bad, im sorry).\n\nThe best thing about this game, by far, is the non-story lore. Unfortunately, I didn't like how it was presented, and found myself often trying to dig for it. \n\nLots of things to like, but the attention this one got baffles me. There are many better crpgs to play, especially if you crave a meaningful story.\n\nThough, the ending was great, completing this game felt like a chore to me.",

You can definitely get a sense of the roots of this title in the Baldur's Gate titles from years gone by. Overall the story is not an \"in-your-face\" adventure, but rather a drawn out adventure that takes its time to unravel. Something truly akin to the realm of tabletop RPG's, and many cRPG's of North America. Controls  are simple, and can almost be entirely played with one hand on the mouse when using the optional \"pause action\" feature giving the title a strategic appeal. Personally, this is a fantastic title. Don't let the 2015 release date.",

Story is great (albeit not very well told) \n\nMy only real gripe with this game is the way the boss fights are implemented. \nFirst of all having to go back through the entire text box/cutscene ever time you fail is super annoying. \nSecondly there is no real scaling when it comes to boss fights. I feel like the general mobs were paced pretty well, but when it comes to a boss fight you could be literally cruising through the mobs then BAM! Heres a boss that 1 shots your entire party with an AOE and has defences so high that you can barely scratch them. \n\nI have no issue with learning how to beat a difficult enemy, or with spending time trying to beat tough boss. However, I dont like the jarring swap between feeling like your party is well balanced, and with a good composition when fighting the mobs, and then getting absolutely crushed by a random boss fight as if you've got the worst group of individuals you could have rounded up. I feel like the bosses needed to be a bit more creative in terms of arena/mechanics rather than just straight up being OP and forcing you to bash your head against the brick wall until you work out what spells you need to spam for 20 minutes to get the job done. \n\n7/10\n",

I didn't much care for the combat - it was very janky and hard to grasp for me, but despite that, this is one of the best RPG's I've played in recent years. I've done just about everything there is to do in the game in one playthrough (a lot of my playtime was offline via Steam Deck, so hours weren't counted), and it was a joy from start to finish. Be warned, there is A LOT of reading, and if you are planning on skipping dialogue and rushing through the game, you will not have fun.",

The interesting part is how to build your characters, but in the beginning practical options are severely limited and later on you walk through anything anyway.\n\nSadly the conversations feel a bit like the combat, they are predictable and flat. If anything interesting can be done non-trivially, it is behind a binary skill check. Consequences in general seem to be very short lived, contained, and often emotionally irrelevant.\n\nThe story tries to make you care about the protagonist progressively losing their mind, but at no point does it actually feel like that is the case, robbing the story of its main drive. Maybe its a personal philosophy thing, but I found the big story twist everyone in-game is so shocked about to be utterly irrelevant.\n\nThe only thing this game really has going for it are the characters. Their stories are just well written. They are interesting, believable, and will make you feel some way. Voicework is great. Wish there was more interaction with the protagonist personally, gameplay and fixed story wise. Companions will comment your decisions but it will not have any consequences whatsoever.",

Balancing your acts goes a long way toward succeeding in this game. It demands much from the player while also rewarding you with much satisfaction for overcoming difficulties. The graphics are fine for its age and appropriate for the style of 2D environments with 3D textured player characters and NPC's. But the graphical optimizations are poor. Running this game with a 5800X and a 6950 XT graphic card yielded as low as 40 FPS in areas with a lot of NPC. The immersion is deep and Pillars of Eternity is very rich in detailing how mechanics and Magical items function and should be used. The battles demand a good level of concentration and proactiveness but allow you to pause it at any time which is a nice convenience. I strongly expect to play this to the end as the story is very engaging so far.\n\nCons: In some of the DLC areas the game is poorly optimized and isn't making make proper use of the GPU. Also, the game sometimes crashes when Alt-Tabbing.\n\nGraphics:6\nSound: 8\nInterface: 10\nStory: 10\nGame balance: 6\nImmersion: 8\n \nFinal score: 8/10",

        "review": "Before I get into the Review, I would like to clear some ideas and tropes. This isn't a \"retro\" game. This is a modern rendition on a particular style of RPG play. First person dungeon crawlers were some of the first games ever made in graphical format...Is Fallout 3+, Mass Effect and Skyrim \"Retro\"? This belief about isometric RPG's actually came about from certain game developers feeling the need to trash this style of play, perhaps in response to customer feedback. \n\nPOE is a faithful and modern interpretation of a tabletop style RPG on a computer, with a complex set of rules and environments to create a consistent world to play a set story in. I won't mince words, this style of play is not for everyone, and much of the criticism of this type of game comes not from the game itself, but an expectation from the player of a generic \"fun\" or engagement based on vague assumptions. Games like this have random numbers, dice rolls, large amounts of reading and an requirement for the player to be part of the enjoyment process. If you can do that, you will enjoy this game, If you can't, I recommend something that requires a little less thought and patience. \n\nI'll only review 2 aspects of the game, the most important ones: Combat and Story\n\nCombat: The skill system is vast, the classes very customizable and options almost unlimited...which is both good and bad. For the good, you can do anything you want, and for a roleplayer invested in playing to type, the building of the character is great (other problems with the story however, I will discuss in STORY). The action is a bit frantic. If you are used to Baldur's Gate or (amazing if you remember and played this) Ultima 7, you will feel right at home with your hand on the pause button. I prefer the control of turn based, but it's not bad at all. The game does reward you for knowing what you want and pushing for it early, and the sad truth is there is a \"right way\" to build your character amid options that will cause you nothing but trouble. \n\nStory: This  is pretty subjective, and I can't help but appreciate the tremendous work and time that went into the world building, story and characters. It's truly vast and epic. So I'm a little sad to say over the years of owning this game, I've never really enjoyed the story that much, or got invested in it's world. Much of the worldbuilding is too vague. It's hard to tell a real cultural difference between the races and factions of the game. The Characters do a little better with the myriad twists and connections. The Dyrwood is a diverse collection of races who fought for independence from the Aedyr empire...another diverse collection of races, and there's another country...which is also a diverse collection of races. All with very similar attitudes, social mores and prejudices. \n\nI'm not a fan of animancy either, which I feel turns a gritty world into play-do and makes literally \"anything\" possible which just means there's no foundation for anything. The world loses it's heft as everything just becomes a plaything of an overarching ability. Dragon age suffered from this sort of plot design too, where the darkspawn were just a mindless evil thing that has no ecology of it's own. Evil is just an attitude, rather than calculated decision making...except from the mastermind of it all...playing with play-do. \n\nThat said, the confrontations and story beats are exciting, and I enjoyed it from an adventure standpoint, even as I kind of wished the world they worked so hard to build had better foundations.\n\nI highly recommend this game for those that like isometric play and a solid party rpg experience",

        "review": "Having finished the game, I'm going to update my review. I went into this game with pretty positive expectations, and came away uncertain with how I feel about the title as a whole. Though, I think I can chalk it up to a mostly positive experience. Albeit, with a lot of very notable shortcomings, pitfalls, and issues along the way.\n\nTo keep this edit short, I'll try to focus on the main points.\n\nGameplay:\nThere is a lot of fun in the gameplay early on. while the litany of terms that change and get bandied about take hours to get used to, its not so bad. I wish they were more straight forward in some instances, but otherwise it's to be expected with an RPG like this. Especially one that does do its best to bring out interesting tactical choices and options. However, I feel the gameplay gets very stale, very fast, and the difficulty curves on Normal and above really don't do you any favors. Pathing failures are constant. Conversations denying you party formations can raise the difficulty on fights severely. Even further along, there are cardinal sins where standard enemies you're used to 1-tapping suddenly have unmarked, unrelated, unidentified, and unnoticeable upgraded variants that jump you in almost the same numbers you'd expect trashier versions. The only way to tell is to mouse over them, wait, and see the tooltip pop up with their stats - or lackthereof. Especially since the niche tactics never really advance beyond early game levels; if anything, they devolve as you can afford to use fewer elaborations and take fewer hits.\n\nRPG Mechanics & Framework / Meta-gameplay / Genre Accuracy:\nWe already discussed gameplay, yes. Though, this is the framing of that gameplay as a title, and how it interacts with the story, text elements, and the rewards of the system. And this is where the game REALLY fails for me. This game commits EVERY cardinal RPG Game sin in the book, despite having come out with knowledge of the genre from devs with industry experience. Crafting is abundant, but doesn't seem to be wholly worthwhile until the absolute endgame with an extreme resource crunch. Even then, you run into the problem of only getting the best gear after you've toppled all your foes in an area. Side content offers barely any XP except for a few \"mainstory-adjacent\" storylines, and so your seriously gatekept by mainstory progression. The voiced, storied companions have some of the WORST pre-existing build configurations I've seen - so you either need to rebuild them (if you can), or skip them for empty husks you create yourself at taverns. This game's framing really hurts it as an RPG, and it required many long breaks and bouts of frustration for me to finish the story. But it's not the story or base gameplay that fails.\n\nStory:\nPretty darn good. The beginning is really slow, even for someone like me that really likes slow-start stories. Though, I think the main issues in meta-gameplay and genre-accuracy are what make that worse. Act 2 really shines. Act 3 slows down again, and I have to admit, due to my frustrations, I rushed down the mainquest in a day. The epilogue spikes back up with a great twist that brings us full circle. Its not terribly original. It strikes as a very Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind type story, but original enough to still be fun. I think there are some issues with the conclusion that match the issues of pacing in the beginning, and maybe some buyer-beware over potential plot-threads that are never really resolved.\n\nIn the end, we get a game that is probably worth playing through on its easiest difficulties. I wouldn't really recommend anything else. There are RPGs that are way older, and way newer, and contemporary with this one, with stories that are just as good, if not better. Not to mention, they're more rewarding to play as a game itself.\n\nStill, I'd say give this one a shot!",

        "review": "Epic in length. I'm over 200 hrs in and still in chapter II. Doing white Marsh I&2 before the final Chapter 3. The plus's are many. It does play and feel like the old infinity engine games but with some things better (endless inventory) and some things less (no romances which helped make Baldurs Gate II tops on most lists of best RPG). \n\n The writing is very good. Better than Divinity 1 or II and the world is far better than most modern competition out there not only for the Divinity series but also Solasta---neither has the writing nor lore or adult aimed design. In fact the only thing they have is turned based combat, which I highly favor over RTWP which I never liked...ever. However Pillars II Deadfire has fixed that. Saying that turned base combat alone doesn't make a good RPG...especially when New ideas are gimicky and overdone. Solasta carries level design to rediculous design for thier gimmick to the point they look like arcade game donkey kong levels rather than a RPG world and Divinty has every area loaded with minefield like gimmicks that also kill the area design. A cave needs to look like a cave...not a side scrolling arcade game from the 90s on the Atari. \n Pillars does level design right. It does story and quests right. It has an interesting world and that beats the competition in my book.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is a game that asks a lot of questions. Questions such as: \"Does religion undermine the concept of free will?\", \"Is it ethical for positivist science to ignore the mental well-being of the majority in exchange for progress in the abstract?\", and most importantly: \"How the heck do you make a game like Baldur's Gate enjoyable for a modern audience?\"\nPillars is a major improvement on retro RPG's that, unlike other latecomers, takes into account all the innovations that have come since, adding a lot of convenience while still maintaining the retro feel.\nThe story and setting were a pleasant surprise, with the standard chosen one plot gradually expanding as the game progresses, while the world shifts from standard fantasy to late medieval/early renaissance to tribal. Main quests also escalate in complexity, but always involve moral choice, as do quite a lot of side stories. Unfortunately, these outcomes aren't well telegraphed, and often seem illogical, especially when it comes to side and companion quests. The writing itself is standard Chris Avelone: decent ideas and easily readable, but lacking character and literary craftsmanship. As a result, player companions have interesting gimmicks and personal quests, but lack individuality. \nCombat is also enjoyable, with well-designed encounters and solid soundscape, especially for spells and buffs. The ability to upgrade equipment, including uniques, ensures the Skyrim-like loot system where you can strip every character down to their pants remains useful.\nFinally, the music is quite decent as well, with most major locations having a unique theme. Though it is not as memorable as, say Baldur's Gate, it serves its purpose of adding a quality atmosphere to exploration and combat. Where sound truly shines, though, is voice acting: it took me until the credits to figure out that the first two companions you meet are voiced by the same actor. The game is far from fully voiced, as even a lot of cutscenes rely on speech bubbles, but your companions are all enjoyable (Except for Durance, who is the worst companion in the game: annoying voice, unpleasant personality, useless role, and nonexistent quest).\n\nEven as someone who could never get into retro RPG's (I only got on board after 2004, when we got Neverwinter Nights and VTM Bloodlines) I found Pillars to be highly enjoyable. While its sequel has higher production value, it is not nearly as interesting as the first game. This is an easy recommend for fans of the genre, as well as people who are trying to get into old-fashioned RPG's.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8/10",

        "review": "This one is barely recommended, slightly above average.\nPillars is a heavily D&D/Baldur's Gate inspired CRPG made with clear love for the genre by the guys from obsidian, although few of the original devs remain in the company.\nFirst thing that got my attention is that there is a lot of loading. Plenty of transitioning between areas, many tiny areas like houses would be best if they were pre-loaded for faster access, or load in the background while you roam the map. It gets significantly worse as time goes on since every transition of the game autosaves, and more data keeps adding to the game, making the save time longer. The game keeps 3 autosaves that you can not disable in the options. After years later and plenty of people asking for a simple box to disable autosaves that prolong the already numerous loading screens, the developers decided to not add this simple option.\nThe fights are pretty straight forward real time with pause with two health bars system that's not great. Plenty of per encounter abilities and daily spells are at your disposal. At higher levels, the fights become quite a mess of many abilities and spells being used constantly, especially because of the real time with pause style. This game would gain much from a turn based system similar to old games like Fallout, Arcanum, or the new Pathfinders. Micromanaging 6 characters in real time with pause can be a nightmare at higher levels, especially dealing with area spells. An option to make the combat straight turn based would be great, but it was never implemented. One of my favorite crpgs, Arcanum, did it in 2000.\nThe story is just some noise in the background. Something about The Watcher and the evil guy dynamic, or the ending twist simply did not got me interested. It is not objectively bad but simply not charming enough, fun or spectacular to engage, especially with the many, many exposition dump ghosts you find along the way.\nIf you just focus on the main quests the game is surprisingly short, making it easier to get certain achievements. A short main story is not necessarily a bad thing since it does not constrain you with dumb timed events or pressure you into progressing (like Pathfinder's), letting you free to explore the pretty maps and find plenty of treasure and side quests, althought few of them are interesting, chiefly the souldbound ones.\nIt's not a bad game, but it is kinda bland and forgetful. You will not see people talking about Eder, Aloth, Pallegina, other companions or any of the npcs. I never saw on forums anyone mention the main villain, ever. It simply does not hit the spot of greatness. The game will give you a fun time, but I think it is difficult to make a remark because of its blandness.\nIf it wasn't for the beautiful maps, care for new combat mechanics, many spells and abilities and obvious love put by the devs I would not recommend Pillars.\nAlso, locking an achievement for kickstarter backers only is evil, don't do this kind of thing.",

Well invested money right here.",

I know some people are put off by the lack of voiced dialogue but the writing in this game is superb in my opinion and I enjoy reading it. I had played Wasteland 2 and the original Divinity before this game, but this was the game that made me appreciate the CRPG genre the most.",

        "review": "I had typed up a review... clicked the \"No\" button and it wiped it out. \n\nGood: Baulders Gate nostoliga\nBad: more saves == slower and slower games... get lists of file names, don't re-generate screenshots or whatever nonsense you are doing every save/load yikes. Also good luck keeping your non-beefy-bois alive... defensive spells, tanks with multiple target taunts can't save you from the AI's determination to ignore everything and one shot your wizard.\n\nI played it for 95 hours so obviously it holds some water. The QoL stuff like slow games on the saves really killed the otherwise execellent and relatively bug-free game. \n\nOverall, I think the Obsidan team did a great job of really providing a rock solid and smooth experience. Sadly these types of games are going to be going the way of the dodo and become extinct. \n\nThey don't make enough money as they aren't filled with gotha micro-transations like Diablo Imortal or most mobile games so they are becoming harder and harder to justify the cost in production. \n\nKeep it up folks, I know it's tough out there to put up great quality stuff in this day and age <3",

        "review": "This is a love letter to classic CRPGs, and it does a really good job of it. The gameplay had that classic feel while avoiding some of the overcomplicated pitfalls, it has fantastic lore, a well-written story, and some incredibly likeable characters. The graphics are fine, but clearly not the main focus, and the gameplay is just full of cool little bits, like selecting where in the world your character is from, that make it feel more like classic tabletop RPGs. It does have a few pitfalls though - occasionally it is frustratingly difficult (I had to turn off level scaling for the White March DLC) and I think the end, avoiding spoilers, really robbed the player of a lot of agency compared to the rest of the game. Still an extremely good RPG overall.",

        "review": "Not recommended, simply as it is no fun to play. There are many people on the internet who says you need 100hrs to fully \"grasp\" a game to be able to realy say if it is good or not, to which I say... nonsense. It is more like 1-2hrs, if the game does not have you by than, it is game over. I have \"just\" 4hrs on pillars of eternity and I hated every minute of those, had to force me to play through each minute.\n\nBasicaly on the outside everything seems fine. You check gameplay videos, ingame screenshots and it is ok, thats why you decide to buy, and then you start playing. The character creation is normal, just what you would expect, nothing special, but not bad, you read through races, then clases, then the stats, then the abilities, you can select your own custom made picture, seems fine. At some point you start and are thrown into the game. And thats where the problems seem to start.\n\nMy starting character was killed twice in the first two fights of the game. Fun thing, I start every game on easy to learn the ropes first. So it should not have happened, thats why tutorials, prologues etc are in a game. Start slow, draw the player in. Not here. Something like that did not happen in any other I played (not to such degree). Whatever, I figured it out, but also, the whole fight mechanic is no fun to me. There is no taunt, no engaging, nothing, all enemies go for the most weak character on the field, so your \"tank\" fihts them and the other just runs around. \n\nThe GUI seems functional and ok in videos and screenshots, but ingame it is weird, I could not get used to it. Weird positioning, weird functions. Keybindings also seem not to work properly, like ALT is used by default for something, I chaged it, want to use ALT for something else, but that does not work. Nothing happens. So there are functions you can change the keybind and some where you can change but it does not work, also some keys do not work for a specific function you want.\n\nSFX is solid, BGM reminds me of baldurs gate ... Gfx is .... well everything is too small.\n\nThe text, world, story seems to me dry and clumsy, uninspired, uninteresting. I had no fun reading it all. And there is a lot of reading, much more then actualy action to do something.\n\nBut what realy killed the game for me are the loading times... the maps to play on are small, maybe they get bigger later on, but in the beginning, they are realy small... and there is a lot of loading. Like in the first \"town\", that is not even a village. 4 buildings... like 2s walking time from each other... click door... 10s loading time...talk to the NPC for 4s... and get realy bored as the text is meh... and leave the house for another 10s loading, then walk to next house for 2s, enter... load... read... load...",

        "review": "Obsidian nailed it with this one. A classic CRPG that attempts to revive an almost forgotten genre. I know I've barely scratched the surface of this game so far, but I am impressed. If you take the time to follow all of the lore, the team built an amazingly detailed world for us to play through. This game is definitely not for you if you are looking for non-stop action, or you just hate reading. But if you're okay with wandering around towns, talking to random NPC's and doing random odd jobs for them you will get submersed into a wildly detailed world. The visuals never disappoint. The combat can be rather difficult at times, and takes way more thought than most modern games. I didn't grow up around CRPG's, but have been slowly picking through the \"classics\". I am so glad that Obsidian took the time to bring live to this genre once again. I've already purchased PoE 2 and can't wait to play through both stories. \n\nExtra bonus, you can run this game on practically any modern computer. And with one hand for that matter. I've been playing on a 2017 macbook that has a terrible built in intel GPU and it runs and looks flawless.\n\n10/10 you must buy.",

IMO if the dialogs were more concise and objetive it would make everything more enjoyable to read and pay attetion to. \n\nBUT, this still is a very good game, I'm looking forward to play the next game to see if these things change",

Though New Vegas is better than this due to a more original setting and wacky characters, this is easily one of the greatest fantasy stories in video games with mature themes and fantastically interesting and deep companions (Eder, Aloth, Durance, Pallegina). \n\nCombat is similar to classic cRPG's (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale) but the screen gets too busy to understand what goes on at times and the leveling system feels unrewarding but is still very, very fun. \n\nIf cRPG's don't seem interesting enough or you don't feel willing to try it for a steep price, then just pick the game up on sale.

        "review": "This game has a beautiful story. An absolute masterpiece compared to other RPGs. \nThe graphics and textures are what they are, and the art is great in my opinion. Be willing to let your mind fill in the graphical blanks, and you'll find a beautiful game reminiscent of ye olde Baldur's Gate. \nThe combat and class progression are fun after a time investment, but they probably won't be at first. Real-time combat in a DnD based combat system was never something I enjoyed much, but it manages to be passable in Pillars. Just be willing to use party AI lest you spend 75% of every combat encounter with a beetle paused to delegate actions. Chain commands are a thing, but I find that the flow of combat will often make my chain of commands redundant after two actions. Class progression is not as complex as other DnD style RPGs, but it's still enjoyable. Max level is 16 with the expansions so be prepared for a slow progression. \nOverall, I highly recommend the game. Importing your character to Deadfire is very satisfying, and I don't recommend playing it without completing Pillars 1 first.",

Sure there are improvement from Pillars of Eternity 2 that I wish was in this game, but for me Pillars of Eternity 1 hits a lot things in the sweet spot. I don't know about most players, but for me there are only limited amount of things that I can focus on in a single playthrough. That makes re-run interesting.\n\nBy the way, Paladin is my comfort class. There is just this pull into certain roleplaying archetype that makes them interesting to play, even when you already know the gist of the story.\n\nCheers.",

There is a learning curve if you're not used to this type of combat (which was my case), but just mess with the auto-pause settings until you get it. Also, don't fret too much over what class to play; you'll meet companions of pretty much every class and can even make your own. Just do whatever feels like the most fun to play for the story's sake. I really love building my character while getting to play other classes via companions, upgrading my keep, and the great voice acting.",

Playing a second run through with picked up characters from the story itself, I'm noticing that I missed a lot of early quest which I think caused all the bugs the first play through. Following along with these characters and doing these quest, I'm further along in levels and have done more character side quest which has allowed me to move along at a much better rate then before. \n\nAs of now, I'd highly recommend anyone else that hasn't played this yet to give it a shot for sure! \n\nThanks,",

There's a lot of good in it, the combat was fun and I enjoyed the classes, but it's the little niggling things, like the pathing getting stuck on someone despite the fact that there's a clear path to the side if they just take two steps to the left.\n\nThe story was phenomenal. I loved every step of the way. It had a lot of fantastic story-telling tips, that let it tailor itself well to you, and a lot of things that DM's could learn for their D&D campaigns. Making the companions truly feel like they matter, instead of just being followers.\n\nBut the part that gets this a No instead of a Yes despite the jank, is what I offer as a warning.\n\nDespite the fact that The White March Part 2 does nothing to draw you in, and make it feel worth continuing (due to how perfectly they end Part 1, and the intro to Part 2 feeling so disconnected and unrelated to it), if you do not complete it, it will impact the ending in a way that is incredibly unsatisfying. Absolutely do not skip it.",

        "review": "You are a fresh arrival in the fictional country of Dyrwood, just in time to discover it's been wracked by an ongoing, fifteen-year long epidemic that has resulted in more than half the country's children being born with missing souls. You also encounter a mysterious cult leader, after which you gain the ability to see ghosts, and are haunted by memories of your past life that will drive you insane unless you and your (optional) ragtag band of adventuring companions can find him again before you succumb to madness. Oh, and maybe you'll save the country in the process.\n\nExplore the countryside, fight monsters, get involved in politics, and bathe yourself in Deep Lore (TM) as you adventure with your own curated band of DnD OCs, or team up with other adventurers with their own goals and ambitions, all the while making memorable allies and enemies over the course of your quest, featuring voice talents such as:\n\nMatthew Mercer,\nCoffee Dad from Persona 5,\nMatthew Mercer,\nMitsuru Kirijo from Persona 3,\nMatthew Mercer,\nJoseph Jostar from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders,\nAnd Matthew Mercer!\n\nFor the best experience, also install the White March: Parts 1 and 2 DLCs, where you start your adventure by saving a remote fishing village from a raiding ogre clan, and ends with you doing couples' therapy for a pair of estranged gods.\n\nAs you depart on your quest, remember: do not dump might on your casters, spam overwhelming amounts of CC, and Charisma (Resolve) is an amazing stat.",

The downside to this game is the amount of Flavor text this game has, so following the story itself is a bit tough because sometimes you are forced to read boring text that are easily forgetful. That aside, game is still a gem and the DLCs themselves are definitely a must grab to extend not only content, but additional story that takes place in a snow area; this gives Icewind Dale vibes for me. 10/10 definitely a grab here.",

The voice acting in particular is a huge standout here, and the world and history is engrossing and thought-provoking and often haunting.\n\nThe setting and artwork is absolutely beautiful, and honestly raised my expectations for how aesthetically pretty and grand and memorable an isometric game like this can be. There were several moments midway through the game that left me a bit stunned at the visual spectacle of it all, just there unassuming in the background.\n\nI did find the combat systems to eventually become somewhat of a grind, with similar optimal strategies applied the every fight in more or less the same way, but I was so invested in the world that I kept playing. I won't spoil the ending, but I did find it somewhat abrupt. However, that just means I've got to keep playing into Pillars of Eternity II now.",

Eventually you learn which icons are kickstarter icons and you learn to ignore it, but it can hurt immersion. \n--At times is very dialogue heavy. In a similar vein to BG1&2. Voice acting does help. \n\nOverall: 9.5/10 \n\nNote; PoE is wayyyy better than PoE 2 (Sequel has much weaker story imo, and also tended to be buggy).",

READ EVERYTHING, do not ASSume that anything is logical or like other games. \n\nBe completely thorough (including all info pages), don't miss anything (in game or in its rules), or the game punishes you.  It has a specific order it wants things done in, otherwise enemies are ridiculously difficult or easy (and that's one of those trial-and-error things).  While bonus increases commonly seem low, at one level, a certain type of enemy slaughters the party casually, then, two levels later, you can let AI drive with everyone set not to use limited abilities and barely suffer scratches. \n\nThe info pop-ups (hovering over highlighted words) are essential, particularly with things like figuring out that NO bonuses stack (it only uses the highest, \"suppressing\" all others).  But, sometimes that they're most needed, like, \"what does it mean that Might helps healing, is that giving, receiving, only recuperating, or some combination?\" you get nothing.  (Answer: Might is essential for fighters as usual, plus mages, priests, paladins, chanters, druids & whatnots for all types of spells'/prayers' potency.) \n\nAlso, they confuse a surprising amount of words, especially (as a not-really-as-linguistic example), \"clever,\" for, \"rude.\" \n\nReally, it was at least as much my fault, just went in playing like other games of its ilk, was 167 hours in (having restarted realizing earlier mistakes) before SEEING that the bonuses on much of the party's equipment were, \"suppressed,\" on the character page, then hovering on that to read why.  But, that was the last straw, there was a lot of just feeling messed with rather than challenged. \n\nI largely liked the text-heavy aspect, but, it seems like, they took into account that a lot of D&D players seem to love just scouring rule books for hours at a time, and made it more for those. \n\nMight go back to it, and if opinion improves, I'll update this.  Otherwise, if it says I've played a hundred hours since, that just means I kept being hopeful. If a thousand since, and not updated, I've been being an overly optimistic moron, and the opining above still stands. \n\n[Edit: at 233 hours, mods help a little, but, the above still stands, and no game should NEED them.]",

Sure it feels a little dated but like honestly do it for the story and for the game tying directly into the sequel. The scene: Revenge, with guns AND ghosts? How droll...\n\nJust kidding it's great, feels a little shallow at first because it follows the ol' \"God is bad?\" but it also dips into \"science is weird and therefore also bad\"! jk jk it's really good. If you're not vibing with it because it feels too old and clunky, feel free to skip to the sequel. Everyone tells you the game ties directly into it, but the sequel lets you set most of the story flags from the first, like Bioware lets you do for Dragon Age: Inquisition, and Mass Effect 3.",

The game uses a new system with mechanics developed by the Obsidian team and it is executed in an extraordinarily creative and enjoyable way. The story writing is well done and every character is memorable. I highly recommend this game.",

I was enjoying the game so far but now it just turned into hours of frustration as I try to make my way back out in order not to lose all the progress I have made.\n\nBecause a game should be about having fun, and this is clearly designed to trap players and waste their time, I cannot recommend this game. If there is a solution to this I couldn't find, please let me know, otherwise I'm off to play something else.",

Obsidian did very good job with this one. \n\nHowever, this game is not for all, and you have to do A LOT of reading and there's not any ''quest markers'' ect. You have to figure things out by yourself and follow your journal. It has very old-school -like gameplay mechanics, and it clearly tries to take a lot of elements and inspiration from older CRPG games, like Baldur's Gate, and improve them. I think Obsidian has succeeded in this, and old-school CRPG fans will surely enjoy playing this more than enough.",

        "review": "Pillars of Eternity is one of those games that we can thank for the new golden age of cRPGs. It is clear that the developers at Obsidian weren't the only ones craving for new adventures in worlds full of dungeons and dragons since they actually managed to fund this game using Kickstarter.\n\nObsidian has really tried to create a new fantasy world to stand out in the crowd. The events happen in a world of Eora, in a country called Dyrwood. Different fantasy races inhabit the world, but again, the humans are the most common. Dyrwood is a place, where the locals still remember a war against a neighboring country that happened some ten years ago. A god named Eothas was leading an army via earthly vessel called Waidwen. The Dyrwoodians stood against the assault and eventually blew up the god. Soon after the war people start being born without a soul, rendering them Hollowborn. People believe this is Eothas' doing for getting blown up, so people start calling the phenomenon Waidwen's Legacy.\n\nSeveral years later the player arrives in Dyrwood, but not without problems. The travel caravan gets assaulted and the player must seek shelter from a rare soulstorm in a sacred old ruins. In its backyard the player encounters a shady cult doing some kind of a ritual with a machine that seems to devour souls. At the same time the player's soul experiences an Awakening, which allows the player to see some events of their soul's former life times. The player want's to know what's going on and learns that they are a Watcher, someone who can inspect other creatures' souls. What caused the Waidwen's Legacy? Can the shady cult give you answers about soul's Awakening? To these questions the player and the adventurers you'll meet along the way try to find answers.\n\nThe world of Pillars of Eternity is crafted with love and care, and the same can be said about the graphical design. The graphics weren't cutting edge even during this game's launch, but the style is distinctive and they seem to stand the test of time. Played from isometric viewpoint, the player can experience these nice, painting like landscapes in their best form. The game has an okay soundtrack and the sound effects are good. Especially the spells during combat sound cool. The voice acting is very good, at least when there is voice acting. Probably like half of the dialogue unfortunately lacks voice overs.\n\nPillars of Eternity uses a character creation system that is familiar to fans of tabletop RPGs, yet this is Obsidian's unique system. For example, points in Might increase character's damage dealt and healing, while Intellect increases the area of AOE abilities. You can't increase your ability points by leveling up, but some items or consumables may increase them for a while. After that you give your character some talents and abilities, which you also unlock more by leveling up.\n\nThe player travels the world doing all sorts of quests. For example, you'll come across a merchant, who'll warn you of a mighty bear who killed his friend. After investigating further, with your Watcher abilities you'll discover it was in fact the merchant, who wounded his friend in a way he wouldn't be able to escape the bear. You can avenge the friend's spirit by attacking the merchant or you can demand money from him. Or you might talk to the merchant, and he may reveal that his friend abused his wife, and now the merchant and said wife are starting new life together. This theme of grey choices is with you the whole game, you can't ever really say which is the right choice. You'll just make decisions and live with them.\n\nApparently a relic from some older cRPGs is the fortress you can acquire pretty early on in the game. The fortress serves as a home for the player and their companions. You can spend resources to upgrade the fortress, but a mighty hall attracts all kinds of outlaws, so you'll also have to spend money in your defenses so you don't lose all your taxes to bandits. You get a prison in your fort, where you can place some characters you'll end up capturing during the game. Tough the fortress has a major pest problem. In the 15 levels of dungeons below the castle lies all sorts of dangerous foes from beetles to forest trolls. Maybe the most hardest fight of the base game is located in the lowest level. At least I couldn't beat that fight.\n\nThe fights happen like in the classic cRPGs: Real time strategy with pause. When a battle begins, you'll want to pause the combat immediately, issue orders for your characters and the un-pause the combat to see what happens. After a few seconds the battle goes to some direction and you may want to pause again to issue new commands. It may get tiresome after a while to issue the same commands every time, especially if your party consist of six people. Luckily you can give your characters AI scripts that determine how they'll act during the combat. Basically you'll set how aggressive or defensive they are and what kind of skill sets they'll use, for example whether your wizard is more focused on casting damaging or crowd controlling spells. You can also determine if they are allowed to use per rest skills. Resting is an important feature. When your characters get wounded or they have used all of their spells, resting in tavern, fort or in wilderness with camping supplies, will restore all health and spells.\n\nEven though I'm a big fan of real time strategy games such as StarCraft and WarCraft, I found the combat in Pillars of Eternity to be quite difficult at times, especially at the beginning. One of the reasons was that it takes some time in the game to gain a well balanced party, since you'll encounter some of the companions well past the mid game. For example, on my first two tries of trying to play this game I was struggling in the beginning. I just couldn't do enough damage, since the first two companions you'll encounter are a crowd controller and a tank. At my third attempt at the game I chose monk class for dealing damage and then I started to slowly make some progress. You could solve this problem by recruiting some adventurers in taverns, but why would you do that when the developers have created such cool companion characters in the game? A better fix would be that if you could find all the companions in the beginning of the game, but unfortunately not.\n\nThe game runs reasonably well. My system has a Ryzen 5 5600X, RTX 3060 Ti and 16 GB of RAM, and I played the game at 1440p resolution. The game definitely doesn't have a lot of graphical options to choose from, but I had the graphics quality slider set to high. The game ran most of the time at around 90 frames per second. Except in late game areas and in The White March expansions the game would often drop to around 40 fps. This indicates a lack of optimization. But other than that the game ran well without crashing even once.\n\nPillars of Eternity brings this old genre back to newer generation, but maybe it has too much outdated mechanics from the older games. For example the inventory is horrible. You'll end up picking up things and putting them in the endless stash, except when you are going to sell stuff from the stash and you have 10 pages worth of stuff there, the game seems to start running quite slowly. Also the character creation is kind of annoying since you don't know what kind of skills and stuff you'll unlock down the road, you'll just have to experience them by yourself.\n\nAnyhow, great story, interesting world and companions make this game a nice experience. Once you get the hang of the combat mechanics and manage to gather a competent party, the game is nice to play. There are still a few boss fights and encounters that'll make you throw your keyboard across the room. After my around 60 hour long journey I still don't know everything about how the combat works, but at least I managed to get by. I'll give Pillars of Eternity my recommendation and a score of 3/5.\nMan I hate character limits when writing",

        "review": "Have owned the game and played it on and off for years.  Enjoyed it, loved the polish, scratched my itch for the genre, but always lost interest.  Just completed it for the first time.  Previously I'd always struggled to get involved in the story - seemed convoluted and disjointed.  But now after really taking the time to delve into it and see how each individual story (of companions or regions) interconnects naturally and masterfully, I can say this is one of the real strengths of the game.  The writing is phenomenal - like a well written novel.  \n\nI also wish I'd understood more about the combat and class mechanics when dabbling previously.  I never bothered following specific min-max builds offered by others, always just played around with builds on the fly until I got past certain difficulty spikes (one of the few real frustrations I felt in playing - some of the spikes are HUGE, but once accepted the battles were unwinnable, I'd sometimes come back well later with more levels under my belt and be fine - if it's too tough, walk away for a while).  \n\nBut the main advice I would give myself if starting for the first time is make sure I really prepare 2 tanks and 4 DPS (or 3 and 3 maybe?  But 2 worked well).  Not enough to just have a fighter and a paladin or berserker and spec them whichever way I liked.    I found it far preferable to make sure any choice for those frontline characters was always defensive.  This is different to how I'd approach Baldur's Gate for instance.  I also frequently mixed up my NPCs - changing the party balance over and over, and loved the experimentation.  It's nice to be able to have an NPC auto level to match the party so you don't feel like you have to stick with the same ones through the whole game.  There's no real downside to switching party members and that made the game feel more expansive and opened up my options for fun enormously.\n\nAs mentioned before, I was initially baffled by the combat and class mechanics - thought of it all as inconsequential - many options didn't really seem to offer much \"oomph\" on the face of it.  Many spells seemed a bit bland.  But I was wrong.  The little things count in this game.   \n\nFinal comment is about the story again.  Best ending to any RPG I've played over the years - purely because of the impact my actions and choices made in the end (and during play too), and the consequences, many unimagined but very believable.  I won't be more specific than that, but for someone who often fears ending a game and prefers starting new characters when I'm only part way through \"to keep the magic alive,\" just so the game will never lose its appeal to me (I think I've \"finished\" maybe 2% of all the RPGs I've ever started 100s of times over but enjoyed them anyway) I can honestly say I'm very glad I finished this one and that I left some side quests unfinished - as I now know I want to play through again to see what might have been (and there are some battles I still needed to win).  Very satisfying.  Before I start a new playthrough though, I'm going to finally start a game I've wanted to play for years but had to do something else first: Pillars of Eternity II here I come.",

        "review": "One of the most important games to an entire genre of RPGs. It revitalized people's interest in CRPGs like Baldur's Gate thankfully to the credit of Kickstarter. \n\nIt's an incredibly narrative-dense game. The more you put in to learning about the world and the story, the more you are going to get back. The classes all feel very unique, and have very specific functions within a party. No class is necessarily \"bad,\" and you can make any combination of them work. The best part of character creation is how the skill point allocation system works. You create characters more based on personality traits that have effects on how they behave in combat. For example, if you create a Warrior (Fighter) character and keep them at 10 Might (the default skill level) +0, but increase their Intelligence to 16 (+6), you will have created a Fighter character that is an intelligent individual but the Intelligence statistic will affect the duration of effects in combat, instead of a generic increase to \"magic strength\" or something of the like. This particular Fighter character may not hit very hard with only 10 Might, but when they knock someone down with a Shield Bash, the duration of the knockdown will be longer. Inside of conversations, they will have wit and charisma because they are \"smart\" from the +6 Intelligence.  Therefore, you can create any type of personality you want while not sacrificing a characters ability to perform inside of combat scenarios. \n\n+ I found the story to be incredibly engaging even though its an incredibly slow-burn.\n+ Once you begin to understand how the combat works, the game becomes very addictive.\n+ The artwork is gorgeous.\n+ The music is gorgeous. \n+ The skill allocation system is extremely unique and unlike any other RPG I've played.\n+ Character customization is deep and very engaging. I love building out various characters. Imagination can run wild. \n- The tutorials in this game leave much to be desired. Using the internet as a resource is almost a must to understand exactly how some combat scenarios play out. \n- You will have to read the in-game Journal to really understand things and nothing really points you in that direction.\n- The story takes a while to get going, but I was engaged right from the beginning. I like slow paced narratives however. \n- The concepts of the narrative may have a niche audience. I however resonated with the main message of the game. It fucks.\n\n",

        "review": "I recommend this game to people who enjoy the CRPG experience. I do not recommend it to anyone else. If you're coming from Divinity or Dragon Age -- trust me; this ain't it, chief. I'll still (halfheartedly) recommend it because it wasn't bad for a fundraiser game, and I support the developers in general.\n\nWhat annoyed me: \n\n1. It's not optimized. I have no idea why I'm getting bad frames in certain fights on a game from 2016 that looks as bad as this. \n\n2. I have an SSD and this game is still a loading screen simulator. Literally hundreds and hundreds of loading screens. Beware. It felt like I was minimized and looking at memes for half the game.\n\n3. AI pathfinding and behavior. I hate it. My people don't go where I want them to, and sometimes don't do what I want them to.\n\n4. Missing voice lines. Some of the voice work was pretty good, but it felt weirdly disjointed when someone is talking to me and they suddenly stop talking to me and it's just silent text....then they maybe start talking again. I understand the budget constraints and the desire to add more dialogue slides to give more information to the player, but it still bugs me.\n\n5. I'm a hoarder and this game is bad for my addiction. I barely upgraded anything until near the end-game because so many great \"best in slot\" items come very late. I had tons of crafting materials and barely crafted anything. I'm not sure how to change the design around this personally, but I know better systems do exist because I haven't had this much of a challenge managing resources in a long time.\n\n6. For those of us who aren't obsessive about each combat encounter to the point where we are familiar with all 100+ spells across all six characters in your party and what each mechanic does to help or hinder you, it can get rather repetitive. There were some things I just never used. I understand this is the nature of classic RPGs sometimes, so this will not bother most people familiar with the genre and I won't say this is a detriment to the experience. Better to have more choices during combat than not enough, I suppose.\n\n7. Not allowing me to murder all the backer NPCs without impunity (this is a joke). My character was a benevolent/honest Paladin, but he had zero tolerance for these fourth wall breaking creatures that serve solely as a vehicle for some GoFundMe backer's shitty RP character backstory. I lead a holy crusade against them, and in my head canon I didn't send their souls back to the Wheel of reincarnation, but into an eternal eldritch hellscape that exists outside both time and space -- the likes of which would give David Cronenberg nightmares.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n1. Story was half decent.\n\n2. Voice work was pretty good. Matt Mercer is the MVP.\n\n3. Lore is pretty fleshed out and interesting. Not many games have reincarnation as a central theme so I found it to be a fun thought experiment.\n\n4. It's not a one-off and there's a sequel that actually adds some consequence to your choices in the first game here. I also like that Avowed is being made, so my understanding and appreciation for Eora will not be unrewarded beyond just a sequel. A Skyrim-esque experience may be what the Pillars franchise needs to have new life breathed into it.\n\nOverall not a bad experience and I look forward to the next one. I hope it improves on most of these areas I mentioned, and if they do, I'll happily make note of it in my next review for that game.\n\nThanks for the adventure Obsidian, and I'm glad your'e back as a company doing what you love.",
