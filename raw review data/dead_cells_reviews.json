Mechanics are good, gameplay is fair, enemies are varied, I don't get bored of the maps because they always change, there's so muhc to do and so many ways to play.\r\nI just have never been a fan of shields that don't negate most damage, specially in a game that rewards not getting hit, but I kind of get the point of it, so I just roll and jump and not use shields.\r\nI used to have this game in another account that I lost access to and started playing again now that I saw they included the Castlevania DLC, which I haven´t had much chance to play, I'm still getting all the starting things.\r\nI really hope there´s some sequel or something to this, it has been a great game, and it just kept getting better and better.",

        "review": "Dead Cells is a 2d action roguelike, with incredibly tight controls and a huge variety of weaponry!\nIt has very beautiful pixelgraphics and animations, it simply looks amazing and the sounds are also top notch!\n\nThere are lots of secrets to uncover and many enemies and bosses to fight, as you go deeper and deeper into it and slowly but surely reach further and further each time!\n\nOnce you've got the hang of it, it comes with all kinds of additional difficulty changes, which really feels like the game just starts there. You get more/harder enemies and less health refills, but its incredibly satisfying to go through!\n\nThere are a few different permanent upgrades to get, which gives you the ability to unlock new paths, which lead to entirely different maps aswell. You can play ranged or melee builds, you can be offensive or defensive, you can be playing mostly using items aswell. There are many different ways and opportunities to try different builds!\n\nWant to go glasscannon and shred through your enemies very quickly? Or do you want to play safe from ranged and take your time and throw down turrets and stuff? Its all possible, but as the items are random, you're never guaranteed the perfect build. You gotta play with what you get and thats making every run different and fun!\n\nYou will be addicted to this for quite some time, once you start! :D",

I got the game on Xbox Game Pass and realized how much I was missing in the PC version, somehow it got better after I thought it was impossible to get anything else out of the game. I enjoy rogue-likes and whatever around that genre and Dead Cells always comes on top of my list. Cancelled Xbox Game Pass a few months ago and decided to buy the game and all the DLCs. I advise you to do the same, you won't regret it!",

The variety of weapons and abilities keeps things fresh as you experiment with different playstyles on every run. However, the game's permadeath mechanic—where you have to start from the beginning each time you die—can feel repetitive and even grindy after a while. While it's undeniably addictive and rewarding, the constant reset after death may dampen the momentum for players who prefer progression over repetition. Still, the game's challenge, fluidity, and replayability make it a standout experience in the genre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It doesn't matter if we like the result of our first decision between bow or shield or not, because we'll repeat it every time we start over, and that's going to happen a lot in this world where we can die at any moment. What we still won't know after that first death is that the answer to that question contains the very gene that makes Dead Cells a different animal from the hundreds of 2D action sidescrollers that abound in excess today: the gene of constant choice. Pay attention to this game, lovers of classic challenges: Dead Cells is a new monster to beat.",

Being able to choose a different path through the various biomes (thanks to the affordably priced DLC) keeps the experience feeling fresh.\n\nI highly recommend this game!",

I love every element of this game and it has a ton of replayability till you master all of its systems. It's super rewarding and has a bunch of really satisfying weapons that make me just happy to use. The bosses are all great, but I find myself wishing for a bit more on the difficulty front. I know this is solely a me thing, so don't let it discourage you from this marvelous experience.\n",

        "review": "I first played Dead Cells on Game Pass.  Then I bought it.  I'm a fan of the Roguelike genre.  Not sure what it says about me if I enjoy dying over and over and over and over again.\n\nThere's something so satisfying in discovering that new item that lets you more further than ever before.  And then dying to some new critter.\n\nAs you progress you try to customize your build to best suit your needs.  What weapons have you got?  Do I boost damage or defense?  These thoughts are going through your head as you go through the 5Ds: Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge your way towards ... another death.\n\nThis is a great, fast action game.  It's one of those games that doesn't take a massive time commitment to play.  You can play 15-20 mins and put it down again.  A full run took me around 30-45mins.  I rarely made it though.  The weapons are fun and eventually you'll be hoping for your favorite.\n\nIf, like me, you enjoy death (specifically your own, and often) and carnage (some that is you but more that is the enemy) this is a fun game.  The first few times you play you might play a bit too long...\n\nNo bug or glitches for me.  Just some fairly addictive fun!",

Early on in the game, at the end of each stage you'll get a full refill to your health and your flask (item you can use multiple times to top off your health in stages). Upon reaching higher difficulties, this health/flask refill is slowly stripped away from you, and at the highest difficulty, you can barely survive taking more than 2 hits per stage. You'll eventually have to basically do every stage taking 0-1 hits, it's very hard but also very fun.\n\nAlso, DON'T SPREAD OUT YOUR SCROLL STATS. Pick 1 colour, use only weapons/items of that colour and stack every scroll point you get into that colour. Damage gain from scroll stats is exponential, you need every point you can possibly get",

        "review": "\r\n\r\nDead Cells is a thrilling, fast-paced roguelike platformer that brings a lot of excitement in every run. The combat is quick and snappy, with tight controls that feel satisfying to master. You collect \"cells\" to unlock various blueprints for weapons, items, and cosmetics, adding a lot of replay value as you experiment with different builds and combinations.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this game apart is its accessibility to those short on time. Each run typically lasts about 30 minutes, making it an ideal choice for players who can only squeeze in short gaming sessions. Despite the game's relatively short runs, there’s a ton of content to explore. Multiple paths, challenging mobs, and punishing bosses keep you on your toes, but the sense of reward you get when you finally defeat a tough enemy is unmatched.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the game’s sound design and music are top-tier, immersing you fully into the Dead Cells universe. The variety of unlockable gear, including weapons and cosmetics, gives you plenty of options to personalize your gameplay and keep things fresh.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's a difficult game, it’s this challenge that makes the victory all the sweeter. If you’re someone who doesn’t have a lot of time for gaming but still wants something engaging, Dead Cells is the perfect fit. You can jump in for a quick session, have a blast, and feel like you’ve accomplished something in just a short burst. Truly one of my favorite games to unwind with!",

        "review": "Tight, addicting, fast-paced combat that's punishing if you don't keep up with its rhythm. Environments are very pretty but you often don't get too see much of it as most of the time you'll rather be blazing through the level trying to get to the end. Either that, or you've seen so much of it (roguelite, remember?) that all you can focus on is efficiency.\n\nEfficiency. It's a fickle thing that the game demands for, but that efficiency can oftentimes be a detriment to your enjoyment of the game—efficiency in Dead Cells means going through the same specific set of biomes to get the most amount of cells and power scrolls possible, which leads to fighting the same bosses over and over again, choosing the same weapon and skills with the same stats, etc etc. The biome's enemies only have variety through different difficulties, often adding one or two new enemies with each new Boss Cell collected.\n\nDoing the same thing over and over again, like many things, loses its charm. Even if you're winning.\nThat's me, 50 hours into the game.\n\nAlthough I suppose this is more of a 'me' issue... it's the way I've been playing the game from 1BC all the way to 4BC. And yes, I've been stuck in 4BC for a while. The difficulty walls (specifically at 2BC and 4BC) are a bit frustrating and it's the reason why I haven't had the motivation to 'finish' the game properly, but I'll surely make it if I try hard enough... eventually.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, the game IS fun, and offers a wide variety of weapons and skills for you to play with in three distinct categories which all have their own attack styles (more or less, I forgot the word for it). Brutality, hack-n-slash weapons that let you dice through enemies. Tactics, mostly ranged weapons that use an ammo system. Survival, slow but hard-hitting weapons that actually make you think about your move unlike Brutality (it's not shade at the weapons, it's shade at myself. I don't like Survival ;D)\n\nI guess the one thing I don't like about the game is how vague the lore is. It reminds of Slay the Spire's lore—it's there, but not quite. You'll have to do quite a bit of digging to find things out yourself, if you even want to anyway.\n\nIt's definitely worth the price, bundled up with all of the DLC. Go get it. It's not 10/10 good, but it's damn near it.",

The art is fantastic and the music a straight-up vibe. The beginning can be pretty tough, as with most games, but once you start gaining permanent changes it starts to flow better. This game can be so frustrating sometimes, but that's what makes successes all the more rewarding! I love that the map changes every time because it keeps it from feeling too stale when you have to start again. My one issue is that sometimes the map spawns a situation that prevents me from progressing any further. As best I can remember, this has only happened to me on the first level. When it does happen, I have to restart the run. I got some dlcs as well - they are well worth the upgrade. So far I've played through most of the Castlevania one and I enjoyed the art, setting, and the enemies they made for it. I'm not any kind of Castlevania fan, but playing the dlc made me want to get into it. To summarize: this game is hard yet rewarding as well as aesthetic and I highly recommend it.",

Learning the simple mechanics is only a quarter of the battle, mastering them takes you to the halfway point.

In a separate bowl, add flour and salt and mix by hand to combine. Pour your water mixture into your flour and mix by hand until you get a rough dough, then transfer to a work surface and knead until it starts to pull away from the work surface and is relatively smooth.\r\nPlace your dough in a greased bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 - 2 hours at room temperature or until double in size.\r\nPunch down your dough and dive into 300g pieces. Form those pieces into balls and place them in a floured proofing pizza box, cover with a lid, and proof at room temperature for 3 - 4 hours. (If you do not have a proofing pizza box, you can use a floured baking sheet, cover it with an inverted baking sheet and wrap it in plastic wrap.)\r\nAmerican Pizza Sauce and Toppings:\r\nIn a medium sauce pot, add butter and olive oil. Set that over medium-high heat; once the butter melts add garlic, cook until fragrant, add pepper flakes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic begins to brown on the edges.\r\nAdd crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and a splotch of olive oil, boil over medium-high, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally or until thickened and viscous—season with salt to taste and let it cool down.\r\nAssembly.- Place one of your pizza doughs onto a floured pizza peel, and flour your dough generously.\r\nPunch your dough down in the center, working your way out to create a ¼” wide. Pick up your dough, place it over your closed fists, and rotate it around, gently stretching to 13” to 14”.\r\nPlace a couple of spoons of your sauce, starting in the center, spreading in little circles, and working your way to the edge until it gets evenly spread out.\r\nIn a medium-size mixing bowl, place mozzarella cheese, Monterey Jack, and Parmigiano; mix until combined. Sprinkle your cheese mixture to your desire and place in the oven onto your baking steel and bake for 5 - 7 minutes or until the edge gets golden brown and the cheese melts.\r\nEnjoy.",

The combat is amazing, (easy to learn, hard to master), the environments are extremely varied, as are the enemy types, and the bosses are top-tier (especially the first boss in the Castlevania Update, I was speechless!) Do yourself a favor and go for it; this is a game that will have to going for one more run over and over again, and with the new features introduced in the latest update allows for the use of checkpoints for the first time, as well as other features to make the challenge a little more surmountable, if you so choose. Don't delay; get Dead Cells today!\n\nUpdate: If you like Dead Cells, do yourself a favor; get the \"Medley Of Pain\" bundle (available here on Steam) so you can enjoy the complete game, with all of the biomes, weapons and cosmetics that you can unlock over the course of the game; playing it any other way isn't the full experience, and I would recommend this game and all its DLC wholeheartedly to anyone who's looking for an amazing combination between the rogue-lite and metroidvania genres. Don't delay; get it today! And either way, have an awesome day!",

Even more so when it takes over 20 mins or longer depending how late game the boss is.\r\n\r\n6/10, If you want a fun Roguelike play BlazBlue Entropy Effect or Hades.",

Meticulously designed, smooth and snappy gameplay, breathtaking pixel art (reminiscent of watercolor), and such fun exploration (especially with all of the DLC). You can play the game hardcore, or play it chill. 10/10, game of my lifetime.",

Play Blasphemous or The Messenger instead, they actually have a checkpoint before boss fights, you don't need to play again through the whole game (which you already almost do without getting hit) again and again, just because you sneezed or didn't now the all the moves of the boss beforehand. Sad! The rogue-like permadeath concept got twisted and applied out-of-context in my opinion. The sad part is that I don't get to explore the whole game because of this. I'm sad for the work people put into it and never gets seen!",

        "review": "This game may have the most confusing intro I've ever played, I got the DLC before starting to play, and I'm accosted by simon Belmont and took on a story before I even know the base lore. I get that games like this like to slowly dripfeed lore, but I want at least a task or an overarching goal before being asked to commit hours of time to it. Is the goal to escape? What am I escaping? Who is my character? Why are there all these strange characters who all pop up at the beginning of the game with no introduction? Why does this game have the worst intro for a roguelike that I've ever played? I'm sure it gets good later on, but at this rate I'm so frustrated that I don't even want to play the game again.",

This ensures a compelling and replayable experience.",

Little did I know I'd get so addicted to this game because of how unique every run is. I haven't had a single instance where something's happened two runs in a row. Each run is unique, and that's what makes it fun. I recently just got the steam version, and modding the game is really fun, but if you want the full experience, I'd recommend playing the game using a controller without mods.",

        "review": "Title: “Dead Cells: The Game That Loves to Watch You Suffer”\r\n\r\nIf you ever wanted a game that combines the thrill of a dungeon crawler with the emotional rollercoaster of a soap opera, Dead Cells is your ticket to a wild ride. Imagine if your favorite platformer and roguelike had a baby, and then that baby decided to grow up and become a professional torturer. That’s Dead Cells for you.\r\n\r\nFirst off, let’s talk about the plot. Oh wait, there isn’t one! You’re a blob of cells that somehow got a body and now you’re running around an island prison, dying repeatedly. It’s like Groundhog Day, but with more spikes and fewer groundhogs.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is where the real fun begins. You start off thinking, “Hey, this isn’t so bad,” as you slice through a few enemies. But then the game decides to remind you who’s boss. Suddenly, you’re surrounded by monsters, traps, and the occasional boss who looks like they just stepped out of your worst nightmare. And just when you think you’ve got the hang of it, you die. Again. And again. And again. It’s like the game is saying, “Oh, you thought you were good at this? That’s adorable.”\r\n\r\nThe graphics are beautiful, which is great because you’ll be seeing the same levels over and over again. The music is fantastic too, providing a lovely soundtrack to your repeated failures. And let’s not forget the weapons! There are so many to choose from, each one more useless than the last when you’re up against a boss with the reflexes of a caffeinated squirrel.\r\n\r\nBut the best part? The permadeath. Nothing says “fun” like losing all your progress because you got cocky and thought you could take on that elite enemy. It’s a humbling experience, really. You start to question your life choices. “Why did I think this was a good idea? Should I have just played something easier, like Dark Souls?”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dead Cells is a fantastic game if you enjoy a challenge, beautiful graphics, and the sweet, sweet taste of defeat. It’s a game that will make you laugh, cry, and possibly throw your controller across the room. But hey, at least you’ll have fun doing it.",

I enjoy action/fast-paced roguelites and this one is simply just a snooze/badly programmed one that should be really be updated. There is no action cancellation on attacks/skills and the majority of them take a few seconds to activate, feeling non-responsive majority of the times. You can complete the game EASILY on the first run and then it becomes a grind fest that is slow and tedious without anything new to add. Really disapointed.\r\n\r\n Would refund it ASAP but the 2 hours steam refund TOS is not letting me. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy fast-paced responsive roguelites do NOT buy it! It might had been \"good\" many years ago compared to other trash roguelites of its time but currently they are much much much better games to play.",

Your HP don't exist on such difficulty, and Survivial stat no longer gives you a lot of HP and its mutations and weapons are very weak. And on top of that curses are everywhere now.  \r\n\r\nI beat 5BC boss a couple years ago several times. Now I can't get to the Giant on 4BC.\r\nI'm getting tired of getting oneshot from bullshit, curses, platforming.\r\n\r\nRight now you no longer need to carefully choose your mutations. Game provides you with a lot of weapons which works with most mutations. Why pick a slow weapon and defensive mutations? You gonna die in 3 hits anyway. Fast red weapons always would be a better choice. And feels like devs counter it with more curses and more garbage weapons from new dlc.\r\n\r\nSome aspects of platforming are complete trash. Why do you even make a huge spike trap with one tiny square pillar on which you suppose to land? You have 1 in 10 chances to land on it without taking damage. Character either climb it and puts his ass on spike or fall from it cause its too tiny. And its not the only example. Avoid challenge portals without \"extra jump in mid air\" affix on amulet and its random roll... \r\n\r\nSo yea the game no fun any more.",

Make sure to buy all the DLCs as they add tons of content: new biomes to explore with their respective bosses and equipment. Totally worth it!!",

        "review": "By far my favorite roguelike game I own. I've had so much fun replaying it. It's pretty easy to get the hang of and it's difficult sure, but just the perfect amount of difficult. There are some cool references from other games you might know in here too. I just love all the outfits you can unlock, along with the weapons that each have their own gimmicks. Another thing that needs to be mentioned are the playstyles. Whether it be a hack and slash melee build or a steady pace ranger build, there's a playstyle for everyone. I personally like to go with a full brutality build but there are so many options. I recommend using weapons that are able to stun enemies, since this was what helped me beat some of the harder bosses most of the time. The platforming aspect of the game isn't too hard either, and I should mention I'm extremely bad at platformers. This game also has many secrets which makes you have to carefully spot for on the screen, which was a very fun discovering them. It gets frustrating dying sometimes, but pushing through every run, you get further and further. Then you get a feeling of accomplishment after seeing the credits roll. Even after completing the game for the first time, it's not the end yet because now you're able to make the game more challenging to progress throughout the story and making the game adapt to your new strength. The lore of Dead Cells is pretty interesting and was something cool that I had to piece together each run. It is undeniably time consuming (I should know, I've stayed up many hours just to make a dent through progression of the game), but it's definitely worth the experience. I'll remember this game by the amount of times the beheaded has given somebody the middle finger. Overall it's 10/10 game, so get it and escape the dungeon, leaving no one in your path to stop you.",

Eu simplesmente poderia elogiar tudo, o fato que você vai ficando mais forte a cada run, o aumento de dificuldade pelas as células de boss. o fato que você vai aprendendo o jogo e vai ficando melhor nele e como isso é satisfatório. as skins que tem varias mt pikas apesar que também tem varias recolors oque é meio paia.\n-Geração Procedural e as fases: Apesar de ter jogando tanto que percebi a geração é mt boa com poucas partes onde o level desing te \"rouba\" e coloca alguma armadilha ou algo do tipo indo contra a diversão de correr e matar do jogo.\nenfim, o melhor roguelite que joguei na vida e fico triste que a motion twin foi mesquinha e não deixou a evil empire terminar o jogo da maneira que eles queriam. O jogo poderia ter uma atualização final de verdade mas enfim é maravilhoso de qualquer jeito.",

        "review": "A brutal yet amazing game all around. It's a truly unique combination of metroidvania and roguelike and it excels at what it does. \n\nThe game's system for stat progression allows players to choose a sort of identity for their run. Big and slow, fast and dangerous, or tactical and long-range? Within these categories there are dozens of different weapons to choose from, each drastically changing how the player approaches combat, causing each run to feel wildly different. The combat itself is on point, and I would call it hard to learn and hard to master. You start off getting hit by every other enemy, but a hundred runs later you'll be dashing through them like they're nothing. It's really fluid, feels great, and is really satisfying once you get the hang of it.\n\nThe art style is really pretty. It's 2D and pixelated, but the way that the moving parts are modeled give them a distinct 3D look. The music and sound effects are great and solidify the game's eerie apocalyptic atmosphere. There are tons of different areas to explore (with even more in all of the various dlcs, which are all worth the money) and a lot of different unlockable items and cosmetics that give the game hundreds of hours of playtime.\n\nPeople who like roguelites will almost definitely enjoy this game. It's really hard, but if you stick with it, you'll have a blast.",

        "review": "Hades was my digital crack, this was my digital heroin.\n\nFreaking amazing roguelike with a gameplay reminding me of Castlevania, tons of weapons with a different gameplay, difficulty curve is amazing, replayability is very high, the gameplay is extremely smooth and the QoL features are insane. Musical atmosphere is top notch. The difficulty isn't even gatekeeping as you have a ton of accessibility features if you need them. \n\nSeriously what more can I say about this game, if you're checking reviews it means you are considering it. Well just buy the pack with all the DLCs, adding dlcs one at a time would do you a disservice as they can be experienced in parallel and keep the game refreshing.",

It's got a BANGER of a soundtrack, controls feel smooth and satisfying, and bosses are tough, yet fair. I remember this game being so brutal that you can't stop until you finally beat it. Once you do beat it, then you get the option to do it again. Five. more. times. Each harder than the last, and once you're at the top, you're still not done. This is the most replayable game I've ever seen. 100/10 would buy a BUNCH of times more.",

        "review": "One of the best rougelikes out there!\nVery dynamic. Challenging, but doesn't need you to study a bunch of mechanics, you just get better natuarlly.\nAlso, it is filled with funny references to other games, which spawn randomly during a run. For example, last run I stumbled upon a [spoiler]Half-Life[/spoiler] reference, with some equipment related to this game. These are pretty common.\nThe music is satisfying, every composition lets you emerge into the vibe of the level. Sound FX are also great, they do give you a feeling of dealing damage with a weapon and so on.\nOverall, a 10/10 rougelike, definetely one of the best out there, will keep you excited all the time!",

        "review": "Absolutely loved this game! This game features a vast amount of different routes to take on each run and various different weapon combos to use that make the game extremely fun to play. Even after so many runs through the levels I do not feel even remotely bored of this game yet. They also are constantly adding new content. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, includes a lot of subtle lore and storytelling that I still am uncovering years later. Contains a lot of Easter eggs and funny references as well. I was initially worried about the Castlevania addition to the game, but it doesn't actually seem out of place. I loved Castlevania as a kid and getting to enjoy it in this game is a plus.\r\n\r\nAlso, as someone who has low vision, the ability to make the text bigger and have it not break the game is amazing (which Steam is notorious for being bad at). The game allows for in-depth customization to make the game easier to [play for people, for example- an option to change the font for those with dyslexia, and enemy highlighting to make them pop out more for low vision.",

        "review": "Saw people playing this game and thought I'd give it a shot since it was on sale. The aesthetic and pixel art is really cool. Love the art style, music, and unique animations for weapons. I've tried really hard to like this game, but gameplay-wise it's just not fun. \n\nEverything does so much damage. I'll get scroll after scroll and amulets that reduce damage but every mob, even the tiny cute ones, do at minimum 50% my health. I feel like I have to play absolutely flawlessly to progress.\n\nBosses are a frustrating clusterf*** . Thankfully, the devs put a training mode for bosses you encountered. Sounds great. Except every time you die in the training it kicks you back to the entrance to the training room and you have to backtrack all the way back to the boss you want to fight and restart. The devs should've known that people were going to be doing the training fights over and over, and not put all this waiting in between dying. \n\nWith only the bosses being what kills me on a run, my gameplay style has remained unchanged. Instead of \"learning from my mistakes\" like a roguelike is supposed to be, Dead Cells is more just banging my head against a wall until I win. Not my definition of a good time.\n\nAlso, I love the amount of weapons in this game. Too bad I can only use less than a dozen. I understand they have to be unlocked, but it takes 2-3 runs, maybe more, to unlock one item/upgrade/cosmetic. Its a drag, and it doesn't even guarantee it will make future runs easier because I don't know what the weapons play like besides a vague description.\n\nAll in all I feel like getting better every run is just not happening, and permanent upgrades don't really do much to help.",

Every level has a few secrets which take time to uncover. There is so much content in this, it's amazing!\r\nIf you're looking for a fun 2D rouge lite, try this.\r\nThe art style and the music is chef's kiss. Plus: if you liked Terraria, Katana Zero and such, this game is such a heartwarming experience. If you are thinking about getting the game then get it! It's a clear recommendation on my end.\r\nI could praise this game lots more, but i don't wanna bore you.\r\n",

Each run feels different thanks to the randomly generated levels, so it's always exciting. The pixel art is stunning, and the soundtrack pulls you in. It’s one of those games that makes your time feel well spent—frustrating at times, but always worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The platforming isn't super tricky and isn't really the main focal point of the game. Rather, the charm of the experience comes with the various different builds you could make, some straight up breaking the game (won't spoil for obvious reasons). \n\nThe learning curve is steep though. You could clear your first run in a matter of 10-20 hours. After you beat the final boss on each ascending difficulty though, you unlock a new boss cell which adds more of a challenge to your runs, should you want to have them activated. From there, the game stops being a snooze fest where you can one shot every enemy by just slam jumping, and you're forced to use your skill. \n\nOverall, 8/10. The lore is also real neat too.",

        "review": "[h1]Dead Cells: A Hardcore Challenge for Fast Hands[/h1]\r\nDead Cells is a notoriously challenging game, and that’s something to keep in mind before purchasing it. I had a few hours of fun before realizing it might be too intense for my reflexes. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy rogue-lite games but prefer a more forgiving difficulty, I recommend checking out Skul: The Hero Slayer. It's a game that offers a fairer balance for those of us who may not have lightning-fast reflexes.\r\n\r\n[b] GRAPHICS [/b]\r\n\r\n🔘 MS-DOS graphic\r\n🔵 Ugly, but still bearable\r\n🔘 Fine, nothing too fancy\r\n🔘 Pretty good\r\n🔘 Next gen graphic or art\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b] STORY [/b]\r\n\r\n🔵 What is the story?\r\n🔘 Written by 5 years old child\r\n🔘 Something that'll hook you up with the game\r\n🔘 You can remember the story after you finished the game for a while\r\n🔘 You cannot get it out of your head\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b] FUN [/b]\r\n\r\n🔘 You want to delete it after a few minutes\r\n🔵 It's not for everyone\r\n🔘 Could be bored after a while\r\n🔘 Can keep you entertained for hours straight\r\n🔘 It's already morning?\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b] MUSIC [/b]\r\n\r\n🔘 Just mute it\r\n🔘 Few of them are good\r\n🔵 Not the best, but it's good\r\n🔘 You get immersed in the game\r\n🔘 Sometimes you will need to stop playing the game to hear it.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h1] TOTAL SCORE:  8/20 [/h1]\r\n[i]\r\n>=17: you don't want to miss this masterpiece\r\n>=14: definitely worth the price\r\n>=6: if its on sale or free, you could consider to try it\r\n<6: don't waste your time on it\r\n[/i]",

The problem is, if you don't reach the level of skill the game requires because you're not invested enough to learn, then you'll never get to see all of the amazing things this game has to offer. Dead Cells is still l pretty amazing, but after 24 hours on and off for the 6 years I've had it, I feel like I can only scratch the surface.",

There's so many different items, so many different ways to play this game that it feels fresh every time.  After over 500 hours put into this game across all platforms, only now has it felt at all repetitive.\n\nI will keep returning to play updates or any more DLC's that come out, but every second of those 500 hours has been a blast. I may have to retire from the roguelike genre, because i don't think anything could top this one. \n\nThank you dead cells, may we meet again in another lifetime.",

        "review": "Dead Cells is an absolute gem in the roguelike genre, offering a thrilling mix of fast-paced action, tight controls, and beautifully crafted environments. From the moment I started playing, I was hooked by its fluid combat and endless replayability.\n\nThe game's procedurally generated levels keep each run fresh and challenging. The wide variety of weapons, abilities, and mutations allows for endless experimentation and customization of your playstyle. Every death feels like a learning experience, encouraging you to tweak your strategy and dive back in for \"just one more run.\"\n\nThe pixel art in Dead Cells is stunning, with each area meticulously designed and bursting with detail. The animations are smooth and responsive, making every dodge, slash, and jump feel satisfying. The atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the game's tone, enhancing the immersion and intensity of each encounter.\n\nOne of the standout features of Dead Cells is its progression system. Even though you start from scratch with each run, the permanent upgrades and unlockable abilities give you a sense of continual growth and improvement. This balance between roguelike challenge and rewarding progression keeps you coming back for more.",

In terms of difficulty I do think its done quite well, unlike most roguelites where later playthroughs are easier, in this case they are harder. I did not get most references but its quite evident that the developers had a lot of passion for this game!\n\nSome critisisms.\n- 4-5 bc the damage received is quite ridiculous, 1 mistake costing u 80% of ur hp on 2-3rd biome, requiring u to do a mostly hitless run, which i'd say is quite a challenge for many.\n- build diversity is quite limited, since some builds are by far superior.\n- overabundance of interesting mutations, however only 3 slots per run. Truly missed potential. And that's not assuming you're not running some mutations every run due to playstyle / build options (no mercy / necromancy for me). Perhaps nerfing them a bit and allowing 4-5 could add a some of variety\n- fuck the rampager\n\nsolid 9/10, if you're a fan of fluid combat and roguelites this is an easy recommendation.",

The procedurally generated world keeps things fresh, and the diverse biomes are fun to explore. Enemies are challenging but fair, pushing you to get better. Even with permadeath, progression feels rewarding. The mysterious lore adds depth without being intrusive. Perfect for quick sessions or all-nighters, this game’s endless replayability and killer aesthetics make it a must-play. If you love action-packed, challenging Metrodivania... Then this game is definitely for you",

(not that mc or roblox are bad but ive since broaden the scope of games i play).  im sad that the devs are no longer going to update the game with new content but im glad that this game gets to end with a bang with the castlevania dlc. i reccommend everyone try this game out. even if you don 't like pixel graphics, this game will surprise you.",

It's a fun game to play. It's fast paced and fluid. Difficult, I mean i've died a lot and there's a few biomes I haven't been able to get through yet. But generally it feels pretty fair. I did have one run where I made it all the way, I've been playing since then without the starter buffs (so I can unlock more stuff) and havent had a win since. \r\n\r\nI'm not a hardcore gamer though. So I feel like the difficulty is about right\r\n\r\nSome of the weapons are ridiculous. I like that.\r\n\r\nIt's a cool one",

It takes a bit of time to understand the controles but the execution of the enemies was pretty well done: when you discovered a new enemy, you HAVE to experiment and find out their attack patterns, which makes it more rewarding knowing what every enemy does. For new players the game seems pretty hard, which it is, but as any Roguelike it gets easier with every death.",

And the lighthouse level feels impossible to me lol, so there is still a lot to learn and practice.\n\nGame is worth a buy at any price.",

This is a game that has earned it's perfect reputation, and totally delivers on the hype.  It feels good on PC, but is perfect for the Steam Deck.  It's a little more meaty than a pick up and play Roguelike, as I've always been highly motivated to give it one more run, but it's not so big or expansive that short runs between other activities feel wasted.  Motion Twin, nailed the nostalgia, gameplay, tone, difficulty and progression with this one.  Bravo, I give Dead Cells a very strong recommendation!",

There's plenty of choice in this genre, and this $24.99 purchase is really not warranted imo, especially considering the greed put on display by this developer/publisher, even after seeing astronomical success in their sales.\n\nWhole thing leaves a salty taste of baby juice in your mouth.",

        "review": "I first ever played this game in Early Access and it's come a long way since then. Extremely fun game with a lot of depth to it, lots of unique weapons and enemies and a really interesting world to explore full of secrets. It has a ton of replayability, being a roguelite, and lots of builds to try out, so there's something for everyone. Soundtrack is great, especially the Castlevania tracks, Combat is fast-paced and very roll-centered like certain other games (that too many games want to be like, imo) but it works for this game. Or, if you want to be more daring, parrying is also an option. I've been playing for a while now and still have more to see.\n\nBut, It also fell for the trap of deciding it needed to cater to tryhards with the endgame content. I can understand having difficulty levels, but a significant amount of unlocks and content is locked behind those and those suck the fun out of the game more and more with each level of it. I've been able to handle them, but it doesn't make it fun to play the game on them at all, it makes it a slog, like, doing perfectly for four stages then getting 1-shot by 4 enemies camping a platform kind of slog. There were a ton of ways to make it both difficult and fun but they went for the more difficult, less fun route. They do, to their credit, provide an assist mode that lets you configure everything about the game to make those difficulties easier, but I feel it should be fun to play to begin with, without needing to customize anything.\n\nBasically, very fun game poisoned by extremely tryhard difficulty in endgame. Increasing the difficulty is fine, but you can do far better than what the endgame currently is, devs.",

Easy to pick up, hard to master, controls great and the art is gorgeous. The only low point for me was some boring and quippy writing, (of what little there is) but it barely distracts from how fun the game is once you get the hang of it.",

        "review": "Really good game, though I would be more enthusiastic for it if there weren't so many bugs on the Steam Deck. Sometimes the camera warps away which can result in you getting hit or dying, pretty annoying if you've got a kill streak or are 30 minutes into a run. The game also freezes sometimes, which can end up putting you back at the beginning of a stage. \n\nI had this game on Switch but recently bought it over here to play it on the Steam Deck but I never would have expected it to run worse.",

Once on a not so legal not-paid version, once on a PlayStation alongside the three later updates of the game and finally on steam over my pc/laptop with all of the dlc included. I have completed the game several times before, almost got all of the achievements and beat most of the bosses hit-less. Even after all my advancements on the console version I decided to repurchase the game on steam because of how special dead cells is to me. The game is rough and I did get angry/frustrated a lot but, in the end it turns out it was exactly what I wanted in a video-game. The charming art-style, the beautiful music, the wonderful game-play served to create what I know to be one of the best games that I have ever played ever. I hope that for those 2 people who read this they bring about the investment to buy the game as I totally have originally and enjoy it as much as I have for what can only be assumed to be weeks worth of hours.",

BUT for my items, left weapon is left arrow key (◄) Right weapon is right arrow key (►), and the 2 extra abilities are up and down. I do this because left hand really should JUST be for movement. Also make the \"use\" ability bound to numpad 0.\r\n\r\nALSO, go to accessibility and turn on highlight secrets. this doesn't highlight every secret, such as secret passages hidden in walls. It only highlights the border of random collectibles in walls when you're close, the reason why I tell you to do this is because they already highlight themselves when you're close, just the icon that glows is so small on my pc its impossible to see it.",

Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nResting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nPreparing the filling:\nBoiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.\nPreparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Sauté the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.\nMaking the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the sautéed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.\nForming the dumplings:\nRolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.\nForming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.\nCooking the dumplings:\nBoiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.\nCooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).\nServing:\nRemoving the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.\nServing: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or sautéed onions.\nEnjoy your meal!",

The DLCs are even better than the base game so that you don't want to go back to base game areas when you get used to them. Especially the Return to Castlevania DLC gives you so much 90ies vibes with its atmosphere and 16 bit musics. \r\n\r\nThe only complaint I have is that the game starts to feel like constant grinding instead of giving pure fun at some point, as you start to get new blueprints and try to unlock them via collecting and investing cells again and again.\r\n\r\n8/10",

Its blend of challenge and reward struck a perfect balance, keeping me engaged through every run.\n\nVisually, Dead Cells is stunning. With its unique art style and character design, the gameplay experience was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nWhat sets it apart is the blend of both core roguelike mechanics with roguelite elements. The ability to spend resources at shops mid-run for permanent upgrades unlocks added levels of strategy without compromising the thrill of permadeath.\n\nAdapting to the 2D platformer roguelike genre initially was quite challenging, but eventually each run became more and more rewarding. Buttery smooth combat, and countless weapon and spell combinations made fighting enemies enjoyable each time.\n\nI feel that Dead Cells was an excellent introduction to the genre of roguelikes, but due to its repetitiveness and several areas blocked by DLC walls, isn't something I would see myself coming back to frequently.\n\n7/10.",

Scrolls choice turns into which of the three colors are you picking\r\n-Platforming controls are awkward and have heavy punishment of losing life\r\n-not encouraged to do multiple runs\r\n-the game requires too many cells to unlock weapons and upgrades\r\n-the game's idea of difficulty is just to remove all healing items so that you have to do an hour run wiht only getting hit a couple of times\r\n-dodge roll has a weird delay after using it; the game does this so you cannot spam it; however they should have just removed some iframes at the end of the roll and let you roll once the stand up animation occurs\r\n-feels like a waste of time when breezing through a run and get instakilled by a boss or cheap enemy\r\n-the game isn't very rogue like without unlocking weapons.  There are limited weapons in the beginning so every run feels similar.\r\n-unlocking multiple weapons makes the game worse by putting more bad ones in the pool; punished for unlocking weapons when you should look up a guide and only unlock the good ones\r\n-the weapons feel too similar to use\r\n-every run starts feeling the same of just going through a maze to collect 2 or 3 scrolls and some weapons.  The biomes do not introduce unique challenges on repeat playthrough\r\n\r\n",

        "review": "Dead Cells is a game I hadn't picked up for a long time, even despite being a huge fan of roguelikes, metroidvanias, and 2D adventure games; however, late is better than never for a game that has become an absolute staple across all the genres that come together to make Dead Cells. The branching pathways between levels is a great addition, as well as level-specific puzzles/gimmicks (some even multi-level) that added a fun spice to each run. Also, after each completion, the game opens up a little more each time, not only adding to replayability, but also ensuring you're not simply running through the same game over and over and over.\r\n\r\nTo put it into another perspective for prospective players:\r\nIf you gauge a game's success and quality off of how many cross-overs that OTHER metroidvania-roguelikes want to be in their game? Dead Cells has, like, 15 cross-over costumes and weapons; several of them with special effects or features, sometimes pushing the boundary of the art-style, but a testament, itself, to it's popularity and subsequent quality.\r\n\r\nI played for 44 hours, with 2 completions, before I bought the ALL DLC (on sale, but not by much), and that's not something I do very often - if ever. There's very few games that make quality DLC, or deserve DLC, and Dead Cells is a stellar example that deserves both and more.",

The game grew with each update, and I loved it!\nOne of the things I love most is the game's sense of humor. There are little jokes and references scattered throughout and i enjoyed finding each one. \n\nPlus, the devs have done an amazing job with the DLCs. Each one adds new layers of depth and content, keeping the game fresh and engaging, I've especially enjoyed getting my ass handed to me in Dracula's castle. The beautiful art of this game is what motivated me to start doing pixel art myself, and that art gave me the ability to be able to own this game once more.\n\nThere's a ton of items, unique mechanics, bosses, enemies and character outfits alongside NPCs that give the game life, it feels immersive and the storytelling is done in a way that lets you discover it through each new room you loot, finding small notes and piecing it together. \n\nTo anyone bored, in search of a challenge, or a new game to play, please play this masterpiece.",

        "review": "Welcome to Dead Cells, the game where dying is not just an inevitability but a rite of passage. This roguelike platformer throws you into a beautifully dark and pixelated world where every misstep, every missed dodge, and every overly ambitious leap into the unknown can spell your doom. But fear not, because in Dead Cells, death is merely a pit stop on your journey to mastering the art of hack, slash, and try not to get crushed by that giant rolling spike ball.\n\nGraphically, Dead Cells is a feast for the eyes—if your idea of a feast involves dark dungeons, eerie forests, and enemies that look like they crawled out of Tim Burton's sketchbook. The pixel art style is not just nostalgic; it's a reminder that even in a world overrun by grotesque monsters and deadly traps, there's beauty in the darkness.\n\nGameplay is where Dead Cells shines brighter than a freshly polished broadsword. You'll start each run as a squishy, naked blob (no, really, you're a literal blob) and progressively morph into a formidable force of nature with a penchant for decimating enemies with everything from rusty swords to electrified whips. Combat is fluid, fast-paced, and as satisfying as landing a critical hit on that pesky boss who's killed you twelve times in a row.\n\nWeapons and abilities in Dead Cells are as varied as they are absurd. From throwing out explosive barrels like confetti to summoning a swarm of carnivorous plants to do your bidding (because why not?), every run feels like a chaotic experiment in finding the perfect combination of gear and skills to survive just a little bit longer. And let's not forget the mutations—because who doesn't want to evolve into a fire-breathing, teleporting, grenade-launching monstrosity?\n\nPlaying Dead Cells is like riding a rollercoaster made of swords and death traps. Each level is procedurally generated, meaning you never quite know what's around the corner until you're impaled on it. And speaking of impalement, did I mention the traps? Spiked floors, swinging pendulums of doom, and the occasional pit of lava that makes you question your life choices—all strategically placed to remind you that in Dead Cells, caution is for the weak (and probably already dead).\n\nBut here's the kicker: death isn't the end in Dead Cells; it's a chance to regroup, strategize, and occasionally curse loudly when you realize you forgot to heal before stumbling into that boss fight again. Each death brings new unlocks, upgrades, and a renewed determination to finally conquer that one level that's become your personal nemesis.\n\nIn conclusion, Dead Cells isn't just a game; it's a pulse-pounding, adrenaline-fueled journey through a world where danger lurks around every corner and every victory is earned through blood, sweat, and occasionally throwing a kitchen sink at a swarm of undead. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of roguelikes or a newcomer eager to test your reflexes and patience, Dead Cells offers an experience that's as challenging as it is rewarding—and as funny as it is frustrating. So sharpen your blades, brace yourself for the unexpected, and prepare to die (a lot) in the most exhilarating way possible.",

I also didn't want something too difficult, and despite the reputation Dead Cells has for being hard, I didn't find it too bad to get through the first few \"difficulty\" levels (0-2 BC).  Overall, I absolutely loved this game.  The play style variety, the lore, the controls...it was all amazing!  Highly recommend it!\r\n\r\nI also want to mention that killing enemies is just so darn satisfying.  I think it's the combination of the pixel/particle effects when something dies, plus sound design.  It's so...crunchy?  I dunno, but I love it.",

        "review": "TL;DR - Game is fun, but I hate it. Recommend on sale.\n$25 - Are you kidding me? Hollow Knight is $15\n\nThis is a good Rogue-lite. (let's be critical here)\n\nI would not have bought it if it did not have the \"metroidvania\" tag. This is not a metroidvania. This is a Roguelike. This isn't an adventure game. It's an Action focused Hack-and-Slash that has a lot of things going for it. They just aren't things that I particularly like. If you're a purest - This is a Rogue-lite.\n\nAnimations are nice. Game has lots of \"variety.\" *Most* of the enemies are engaging without being brick walls or action-killers. The level generation is well designed, and it's clear a lot of care went into how the levels generate themselves. Metroidvania type powers are unlocked that allow you to bypass areas, find new areas, and find hidden loot. Maybe more.\n\nSo, most of the \"variety\" I encountered in this game was surface level, and there was a tactic and combo of weapons that stuck out to me as \"the best.\" This is why I dislike the genre, because there are a lot of cool synergies her, but if you don't get them before the first boss, just restart.\n\nThe game's difficulty curve is... bad. Really bad. This is either an easy game, or an impossible one. You either get what you need, or you don't make it past the second leg of the game, \"Silt Village.\"\nThe lead up to SV and fisrt boss are extremely well done, fun, and engaging. The Village is a mess of overinflated numbers and new mechanics. The stages afterwards are laughably easy. The second boss is easy, but ok. After this point in the game, I no longer needed to spend money or pick up any new items.\nThe stages that follow are laughably easy, but longer, so you lose out on a lot of the action this game was good at. The boss that made me quit - \"The King's Hand\" is bad. Basically, because you can accumulate so much health/power before this fight, they had to just add cheesy mechanics to even it out.\n\nHollow Knight is cheaper than this. \nGuacamelee is cheaper than this. \nBoth are better and have more replayability.",

The controls are buttery smooth, making every run feel fresh and exciting.\r\n\r\nThe visuals? Absolutely stunning. The pixel art is on point, and the animation is super fluid. The soundtrack slaps, keeping you hyped as you slash through enemies and explore ever-changing levels.\r\n\r\nWhat's dope is the replay value. Each death isn't a setback but a chance to come back stronger with new strategies and gear. The game constantly evolves, so it never feels stale.\r\n\r\nThe bosses? Total beasts. Each one tests your skills and patience, but the satisfaction of beating them is next level. Plus, the community around the game is lit, with tons of mods and updates keeping things fresh.\r\n\r\nIn short, Dead Cells is a banger. Whether you're a casual gamer or a hardcore fan, it's got something for everyone. Don't sleep on it. 🕹️💀✨-Mr. GyatPT",

The difficulty, the feeling of dying and losing all your items and cells, starting over again—it's a massive frustration. But you always end up learning something each time you die. I wish I had the chance to pick it up on Steam ages ago, before I sunk countless hours into a 'Jack Sparrow' version of the game. Still, that didn't deter me from wanting to platinum the Steam version, which I'm currently working on. Those 1500+ hours were truly worth it, as I rarely die or take damage now. Now that I've shared my experience, you can buy it without hesitation; the fun is 100% guaranteed if this is your type of game. It's a solid 10/10 for the story, weapon variety, enemies—everything in this game fits together in perfect harmony. So, go ahead and buy it!",

For some insane reason, Motion Twin has been scrubbing their name from the rightful credit that they deserve, and cancelling further support for this game that was planned to go into at least 2025 with BIG updates. They even blurred Evil Empire's name from the credits in the upcoming animated show. They are now also using Dead Cell's name to push their new game as \"the creator's of dead cells\" when not even half of the original team, and NONE of Evil Empire, is working on their new game.\n\nThis is EXCEPTIONALLY shameful, corporate-like behavior. Truly unacceptable. Do NOT support these devs.",

The game starts off kinda easy, but there's a difficulty curve that I really really enjoy. You have hundreds upon hundreds of possible builds that add a ton of life to the game. I am a sucker for the melee, but eventually I'll try out the ranged and tanky trees this game has to offer. This is a must buy if you enjoy fast games. Just one more thing to add, this game has a bunch of possible routes you can take and the deeper you get into the game the more routes you can get, which is really fun but I kind of got my ass kicked because I went down a route that is more advanced. 100 % recommend, this might even be my favorite game of all time.",
