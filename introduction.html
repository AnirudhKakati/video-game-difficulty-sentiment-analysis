            <h3>Overview of Video Game Difficulty and Player Sentiment</h3>
            <p>
                Video games are an artform, and just like any other form of art they exhibit a wide range of styles and genres which cater to diverse tastes among different gaming enthusiasts. 
                While some players thrive on challenging gameplay, finding satisfaction in overcoming tough obstacles, others may experience frustration or even abandon a game if it becomes too difficult. 
                This makes difficulty levels a fundamental aspect of game design that significantly influences player experience and engagement. 
                Finding the right balance in difficulty is crucial as it directly impacts player sentiment, i.e. how players feel about the game overall.  
                Player sentiment can range from excitement and satisfaction to frustration and disappointment, and these emotions are often influenced by how well the game's difficulty aligns with the player's skill level and expectations. 
                Understanding this relationship between game difficulty and player sentiment is essential for game developers aiming to create experiences that are both challenging and enjoyable.

            <h3>Importance of understanding player sentiment</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding player sentiment is vital for developers because it directly affects the success of a game. 
                Video games are a product that developers create and the players are customers for that product. 
                Positive sentiment often translates into higher player retention, more word-of-mouth referrals, and better reviews, all of which contribute to a game's commercial success. 
                Conversely, negative sentiment can lead to decreased player engagement, poor reviews, and ultimately, a decline in sales. 
                By analyzing player sentiment, developers can identify areas where a game might be too challenging or not challenging enough and make adjustments to improve the overall player experience. 
                This understanding can also inform future game designs, helping developers strike the right balance between difficulty and enjoyment. 
                From a financial perspective, all of this helps the developers, the companies behind them, or any other stakeholders involved, in maximizing profit.

            <h3>Who is affected by game difficulty?</h3>
            <p>
                Game difficulty affects a wide range of players, from casual gamers who play for relaxation to hardcore gamers who seek out extreme challenges. 
                Each player demographic has different expectations and tolerances for difficulty, making it a complex aspect to manage. 
                Casual gamers might prefer a more relaxed experience with easier progression, while hardcore gamers may enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes with overcoming difficult challenges. 
                Additionally, game difficulty can also impact community sentiment, where groups of players discuss and share their experiences, influencing the broader perception of the game. 
                Adversely, game difficulty also affects the people and the institutions involved in making them, both in terms of reputation as well as financial success.

            <h3>Current state of research and gaps in current understanding </h3>
            <p>
                Research in the field of video game difficulty and player sentiment is growing, but there are still significant gaps in understanding. 
                While many studies have explored how difficulty influences player engagement, there is less research on how different types of difficulty (e.g., cognitive vs. reflexive) affect various player demographics. 
                Furthermore, existing research often overlooks the nuanced ways in which different player types—such as casual versus hardcore gamers—perceive and react to varying difficulty levels. 
                Additionally, much of the existing research focuses on either extreme ends of the difficulty spectrum, with little attention paid to how mid-range difficulty settings influence sentiment or how dynamic difficulty adjustments might enhance or detract from the overall gaming experience. 
                This project aims to fill these gaps by analyzing a broad range of difficulty levels across different games and examining how these levels impact player sentiment in both casual and hardcore gaming communities. 
                By doing so, we hope to uncover insights that could help developers create more balanced and satisfying gameplay experiences for a diverse audience.
