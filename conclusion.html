            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Our project aimed to explore how players perceive and discuss video game difficulty through their reviews. 
                Using a dataset of 43,000 reviews from 30 diverse games, we analyzed the relationship between game difficulty and player sentiment across genres, metadata, and review content. 
                Our research questions were addressed using a mix of machine learning models, statistical analyses, and visualizations.

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Review Sentiment: <br>
                Positive reviews were predicted effectively with high accuracy (93%) and an F1 score of 96%, though identifying negative reviews remained challenging.
                </li>
                <li>Genres and Difficulty Mentions: <br>
                Attempts to predict difficulty mentions using game genres showed poor results, with models achieving only 57% accuracy and an F1 score of 30% for difficulty mentions. 
                This suggests a weak relationship between genres and difficulty mentions.
                "Co-op" and "metroidvania" games had the highest proportion of reviews mentioning difficulty, at 18%+, while "competitive" and "multiplayer" games had the lowest proportions, at 7-8%. 
                These mentions included discussions of both “hard” and “easy” difficulty.
                </li>
                <li>Player Experience and Sentiment: <br>
                Beginner players gave lower sentiment scores compared to intermediate and experienced players, with differences confirmed to be statistically significant by our tests.
                </li>
                <li>Playtime and Difficulty Mentions: <br>
                Players with shorter playtimes (less than 5 hours) were more likely to mention difficulty, with mentions decreasing as playtime increased.
