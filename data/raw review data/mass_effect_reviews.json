That being said.....\n\nOne big negative against the LE is that you have to have the EA app installed and opened during gameplay in order to play it. \n\nThat aside however the Legendary Edition is great collection of one of the best gaming trilogies to ever release. While some work was done to bring ME1 up to date it is still rough around the edges and unless you have a fondness for it from having played it back in the day the gameplay could drag your experience down, but the story is well worth it regardless. However ME2's gameplay is a big improvement and still holds up really well as does ME3's. \n\nI would recommend however to wait for the game to go on sale because why would you spend $60 on a 3.5 year old remaster of games that are between 17-12 years old. Not saying the experience these game provides isn't worth it, but if you look at the price history every few months it goes on sale for less than $10 so just save yourself some money.",

This story is breathtaking and heartbreaking and there are so many phenomenal moments that left me openly crying in front of my screen. I leave the final game with my heart both full and mourning. Only wanting to spend a hundred more hours with the crew from the Normandy at the very least.\r\n\r\nIt's so funny ... all my friends begged me to play it, saying it was something I'd love. I wished I listened to them sooner. I'd heard how the ending went, I used to watch all the Shepard/Vakarian scenes on YouTube as the games came out. And despite knowing so much, there were a lot of secrets still to be had within the game, and the final moments of ME3 still hit so hard that I could only sit there and sniffle and watch through my tears at the impact of Shepard's final sacrifice had on the galaxy. \r\n\r\nI don't play games for combat really, so I'm not really up in arms at how annoying the first game is to play. I feel like the Legendary Edition fixed a lot of the issues I had when I tried my hand at playing the first game all those years ago. And I'm so glad because it made it so enjoyable that I finally got past the place I had always gotten stuck. \r\n\r\nQuite literally one of my favorite stories I've ever had the joy of interacting with ... I can't give it enough praise. All I can say is that I will come back to this game over and over again in my own lifetime to relive the legend of Shepard. <3",

There's a few things that really show the age: the combat, the binary good/bad choices (called Renegade/Paragon in the game), and the lack of 3D movement, but you get used to it and you really don't need it. The true excellence of the game comes from the relationships you build with people and how each person has their own mindset. Each faction has its own motivation and goals. Some factions are your enemy one minute, and depending on your choices and your own motivations, your ally the next. The individual character development and your impact on them really creates an immersive experience. If you like titles like Fable and the Witcher, you'll love this game. If you're a completionist, you'll likely get 180+ hours out of this game on one playthrough.",

        "review": "Overall:  This is a really great series.  The story is epic.  Just an instant sci-fi classic.  If your intentions are to play on a standard PC then absolutely buy it and enjoy.  The series is worth multiple runs.  Bioware hit it absolutely out of the park.  \nPC:  My complaints really come from EA and experiences with the steam deck. The only downer is the Internet/EA App requirement.  \n\nSteam Deck Experience:  This game will run on the deck.  In fact it runs great.  But if you plan on playing on the go.  Don't purchase.  The EA app makes it impossible to play without the internet connection.  Even if you start the game with an internet connection but you lose the connection you will need to play something else.  The old Origin App you could at least play the game offline with workarounds.  They patched out the Origin app and upgraded to the EA app but refuse to make it a steam native game like they are with the upcoming Dragon Age.  When you go to the EA forums to make a suggestion the community managers are often dismissive and hostile.  They simply are indifferent.  Nothing will make you feel more like a clown for buying one of their products then interacting with their teams on the their forums.",

BALONEY!  Cute graphics in LE doesn't cut the mustard.\n\nI've just finished playing the ORIGINAL ME1, ME2  and soon ME3.   For those of us on the [then] Origin forums, we pledged not to buy BioWare's Andromeda as the door of CONTEMPT & APATHY swings BOTH ways in regard to ME3's ridiculous endings.  A simple DLC (among their many) could have rectified this.\n\nPlease DO play the originals and not this \"cute\" LE version (roll eyeballs).",

There have been many very significant improvements to date over the original. Even the god awful Mako is improved. I kinda endured original ME1 to get to ME2 (though, that said, original ME1 opens up amazingly in the final Citadel mission). Getting through the LE edition is less of a chore than the original, they did fix a whole bunch of annoyances.\r\n\r\nBTW I play this on an Apple Silicon Mac M3 running Wine. It's doing a whole \"I'm faking being Windows\" thing and on top \"I'm faking being an Intel processor\". Smooth as butter, and the LE edition of ME1 looks much better than the original thankfully. It's just amazing how technology has advanced that I've got two layers of emulation going here and it's smoother and looks better than it ever did originally. March of technology!\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying everybody should play this trilogy. Some of the best computer games ever made. The only sad part is EA's and Bioware's loss of capacity to make any more to this level of quality. Still, enjoy the ride, when Bioware were amazing they really were.",

Probably trim off 10-15 hours, because there were two days that I forgot that I left ME1 running while I left the house to do shit all day. I think you could have a thorough and satisfying playthrough on normal difficulty in under 100 hours. This one was also especially long because I used a lot of mods that restored a lot of cut content, so I was seeking every possible interaction between characters. Changed the way I played the latter 2 games substantially. Still cried a bunch, especially at the end. And just like every other time I feel the overwhelming urge to start again from the beginning.\n\nI originally pirated the trilogy back in 2013, and played the \"extended edition\" of ME3. It came at a time I was in a deep depression, and it did a lot to get me through it and pull me out of it. Then I bought the trilogy on Origin. Up to the point that LE was released, I'd probably played through the whole thing 6-7 times. This has been my first time finishing the Legendary Edition. I still keep finding new interactions, new paths, things I didn't know about, and new ways to explore the content of the games. \n\nAnd I know I will play this trilogy again. But for now, it's October and Signalis is up next.",

        "review": "I bought this product thinking it was one game, and was incensed to spend almost a full day downloading and installing it, but it made sense once I found out I had the entire trilogy.  I cared not at all for 3 and only a little for 2, which I tried out for a moment and lost interest in almost immediately, but the original Mass Effect hooked me immediately, I was absolutely blown away by how beautiful and immersive the interactive story was.  Gameplay was a little weak, overcomplected and fairly uninteresting, mostly a distraction from plot events and character interaction, but I got extremely attached to \"my Shepherd\", as players of Mass Effect usually do.\n\nAnd then I forgot my password to log into the EA app, and couldn't figure out which email address I'd tied to it, so there was no recovering my passsword.  I should have realized how bad of a sign that was, but I could still play the game, so I continued on my merry way without a care.\n\nAnd then one day the game simply wouldn't launch.\n\nBioware created one of the greatest games of all time, a legendary achievement in interactive storytelling, set in a fictional world very nearly the equal of Star Trek or the Lord of the Rings...and then EA destroyed it by shoving all the players into a box.  Why, I won't pretend to know; maybe they wanted to harvest information which they could sell to other companies, or maybe they just have a hidebound insistence on industry-wide \"best practices\" which are secretly instituted by a small conspiracy of would-be overlords, who think they can control the world by hacking into video gamers' bank accounts through spyware disguised as an End-User License Agreement.  The mind boggles trying to make sense of such a colossal degree of malicious corporate ineptitude.  \n\nEither way, my short-lived love affair with Mass Effect one only serves to make it more of a tragedy that the save files I put 20 hours into perfecting are now inaccessible to me, perhaps forever.  I paid $30 for the original 2007 Mass Effect game, hoping I might be able to pay some genius modder even more money to retrofit my existing save files for the older program, or else I'll just have to create new characters and slowly fall back in love with the game, while trying not to remember the pain of the original experience.  Meanwhile, my advice to everyone is simple: DON'T buy this game, or any other game that EA has put its greasy, intrusive fingers upon.  Nobody should ever have to sign into a globalist app just to play a single-player game.  Nobody should lose all their save files to a computer glitch or a forgotten password.  Don't let the crimes of EA go unpunished.  Vote with your wallets and buy from literally anyone else.",

I wish I didn't have to waste 100Gb of hdd space having to download and install all 3 games at once, I can only play 1 at a time, why can't I install 1 at a time? I HATE the EA launcher requirement, it often bugs out where the game doesn't actually launch, then I launch the game again and it launches normally but then as soon as I quit the game after I'm done playing, it automatically launches the game again... I don't feel that my hours played counter is accurate at all, I think it's something to do with the EA launcher as I'll see the hours played counter change when I launch the game.",

I wanted to finish it so bad because of how cool it felt to have decisions carry over a whole trilogy, but it's so badly designed it'll be tortourous to see how such potential just falls flat because of how horribly done and directed everything is.\nfor starters, and this alone is a war crime, the controls will never stop being awful, they'll just be in different ways. on the third game, the game literally can't handle inputs sometimes and just gets locked ADS or the shooting gets locked and when you let go of the mouse buttons, it'll keep on going and you'll have to spam click to make it stop (this will happen at least every 20/30 minutes).\nthe game mechanics will be awfully unclear through all trilogy so good luck just winging it or not caring.\n\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT PART:\n\n\nThe story is the most unsatisfying mess imaginable.\nfirst, it suffers from the lie of choice where it's just \"make this dumb choice that is objectively incorrect and should go wrong 100% because it'll actually yield better results for script reasons. Want to make the smart choice? sure, but now half the planet died, a puppy was tortured and half your party will remind you how much of a villain you are for the rest of the trilogy.\" there's only choice if you somehow want to be guilt tripped all throughout the game.\n\nsecondly, AND THE BIGGEST SIN OF THEM ALL, good choices are locked behind extremely convoluted, impossible to predict and completely illogical requirements (the final mission of ME2 is an absolute trainwreck of this). There's a million examples of this, but the last nail that made me uninstall the game without finishing it is that on ME3, I have to choose between annhiliting a whole inoccent race, or annhiliting a not so inoccent but still good race PLUS my favorite party member that I've loved since ME1. I can't end that war peacefully even though I have max paragon points only because on ME2, I chose ONE different dialogue that has nothing to do with this, it wasn't important at all on the grand scheme of things, wasn't even a paragon dialogue and had no consequences at all up until now.\n\nDon't play this trainwreck, please, you'll just be left with an unfinished game, 100+ hours wasted, and an awful mess of unresolved feelings.\n\nTLDR: the game is designed horribly, controls are awful, the third game is extremely buggy and borderline unplayable sometimes, and the story is absurdly unsatisfying and annoying. but please I urge you to at least read my last paragraph about the biggest sin of this game before buying it.",

        "review": "The Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a complete remaster of BioWare's iconic sci-fi trilogy—Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3. With upgraded graphics, refined mechanics, and quality-of-life improvements, this collection brings Commander Shepard's journey back to life for a new generation. Here’s a detailed look at each aspect of the Legendary Edition.\n\nGraphics & Visuals\nThe remaster offers a striking visual overhaul, especially for the first game, bringing it closer to the standards set by Mass Effect 3. The textures, lighting, and models are significantly improved, making each world feel more immersive. The atmospheric enhancements to planets and locations like Eden Prime, Feros, and the Citadel allow players to experience the scale and alien beauty of the Mass Effect universe in a new light. Character models have received high-definition makeovers, which, coupled with improved lighting, make the scenes more cinematic.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEnhanced 4K resolution and HDR support.\nUpdated textures, shaders, and post-processing effects.\nRevamped lighting makes environments like Ilos and the Shadow Broker’s lair feel alive and detailed.\nGameplay & Mechanics\nThe gameplay experience is much smoother and more refined. The first Mass Effect, which had combat mechanics that felt outdated, has been reworked significantly. Combat in the original game now feels closer to the seamless action of its sequels, with improved aiming and better cover mechanics. Additionally, squad commands and abilities have become more accessible and fluid across all three titles.\n\nThe Mako vehicle, infamous for its clunky handling in the first game, has been overhauled with a less bouncy, more controlled feel, making exploration much more enjoyable. The RPG mechanics, particularly in the first game, retain their depth, with modern tweaks that improve the pacing.\n\nHighlights:\n\nEnhanced combat mechanics in Mass Effect 1, with better aiming and weapon feedback.\nMako vehicle handling improvements make planetary exploration smoother.\nUnified keybinds and controls across all three games streamline the experience.\nStory & Characters\nMass Effect is celebrated for its story-driven gameplay, and this trilogy is a masterclass in character development, choice, and consequence. Players guide Commander Shepard, a customizable protagonist, through a galactic conflict involving ancient machines called the Reapers. The choices you make in each game carry over, impacting relationships, alliances, and outcomes in increasingly dramatic ways.\n\nThe Legendary Edition doesn’t alter the story but adds polish to dialogue and animation. Characters like Garrus, Liara, Tali, and Mordin are even more engaging with updated expressions and textures, which make their iconic lines and emotional moments feel fresh and impactful. However, the Mass Effect 3 ending has only received minor tweaks, with the Extended Cut now the default, which does provide more clarity but may still leave some players divided.\n\nHighlights:\n\nIconic characters and nuanced relationships deepen with remastered visuals.\nChoices carry across all three games, creating a unique narrative experience.\nThe Extended Cut ending for Mass Effect 3 adds better context for the trilogy’s conclusion.\nQuality-of-Life Improvements\nBioWare focused on streamlining gameplay, with faster load times and a unified character creator, making it easier to maintain a consistent Shepard throughout the trilogy. The Legendary Edition also includes an autosave function, reducing the frustration of losing progress during missions. Additionally, the Legendary Edition combines all DLC packs—except Pinnacle Station due to lost source code—giving players access to the full experience, from story-rich expansions to unique weapons and armor sets.\n\nHighlights:\n\nUnified character creator across the trilogy for continuity.\nAll major DLC included for a complete narrative experience.\nImproved load times and an autosave feature.\nSound & Music\nThe audio design and music remain as impactful as ever. Jack Wall’s compositions add depth to the narrative, enhancing the emotional tone of each game. The remaster adds subtle clarity to audio, though the changes here are minor compared to visuals. The soundtrack, from the melancholy of Vigil’s theme to the adrenaline-pumping Suicide Mission in Mass Effect 2, is beautifully integrated and unchanged, which fans will appreciate.\n\nHighlights:\n\nIconic soundtrack with improved clarity.\nHigh-quality voice acting remains one of the series’ strengths.\nMinor adjustments to audio fidelity, primarily in environmental effects.\nPerformance\nOn modern consoles, Mass Effect Legendary Edition performs smoothly, with options for favoring performance (60 fps) or graphics quality (4K) on consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. On PC, the game runs even more fluidly, with customizable settings and support for ultrawide monitors, bringing a cinematic feel to the trilogy’s expansive environments.\n\nFinal Verdict\nThe Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a respectful, polished remaster that succeeds in preserving the soul of the original games while making meaningful improvements. For newcomers, it's the perfect gateway into an iconic sci-fi saga. For veterans, it’s a welcome return that respects their nostalgia while adding fresh layers of beauty and refinement.\n\nPros:\n\nStunning visual upgrades that make the galaxy feel alive.\nImproved combat and mechanics, especially in Mass Effect 1.\nUnified character and DLC integration for a streamlined experience.\nCons:\n\nSome minor bugs and glitches remain.\nEnding controversy remains unresolved for some players.\nLimited gameplay changes in Mass Effect 3.\nScore: 9/10",

I remember replaying both games several times in order to get the ideal outcomes for the (then) upcoming ME3.  ME3 then came out not long after and it was the first game I ordered as the collector's edition, and first one I bought all DLC for (it was a very different time back in 2012).  I've lost count of the number of full trilogy playthroughs I've completed.  \r\n\r\nWhen I moved on from the 360, moving over to the PS4, I sold my former console, and with it, the original ME trilogy copies I had.  I remember being disappointed that I couldn't play them as they were always my go to games to replay over and over again.  \r\n\r\nI was therefore thrilled when they announced the Legendary Edition.  I actually own two separate copies of it; one for the PS4 and one on Steam.  The PS4 copy was first when it first came out and I blitzed through it like it was 2012 again.  The Steam copy was more recent (just a few days ago at time of writing) as I now mainly use my gaming PC.  \r\n\r\nIf you love RPGs (especially the classics like SWKOTOR) you will love this game and I would highly recommend it.",

We just want to launch the game from steam without the middleman. Also this like other EA and Ubisoft games, is opted out of Steam Family Sharing. So if you think you're going to share this like a physical copy think again. I have over 600 steam games of which almost all non-shareable games are exclusively either EA or Ubisoft titles. \n\nBuy EA and Ubisoft games on sale not full price. If they remove the ea app and opt-in to family sharing it's worth full price. Compared to a physical copy it just doesn't offer the same value.",

The second game is the sweet spot for most people, in terms of having both a satisfying narrative (Which is weaker than the first one's overall, and has better pay-off but worse build-up than the final game) and satisfying gameplay.\r\n\r\nME3 remains ME3, which is a shame in some respects (Nothing can *fully* salvage the ending, but at least with the Citadel DLC bundled-in you shouldn't feel too oppressed by the lack of closure it brings), but it remains the best Third-Person Shooter I've ever played, and strikes a genuinely strong balance between the first two games' RPG elements to allow for some immensely fun replay value, both mechanically *and* narratively.\r\n\r\nIf you've always wanted to *try* an RPG, a Third-Person Shooter, or specifically a hybrid of the two, and you've never really known where to start...you couldn't do much better than this.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n*(Besides ME3's multiplayer, anyway)",

        "review": "The Mass Effect series is one of the best sci-fi games ever... until the ending of ME3. Mass Effect 3 was Game of Thrones Season 8, before Game of Thrones Season 8. There were hints that the story was going off the rails and the writers had their heads too far up their collective posteriors earlier in ME3, but wow did they think far too much of themselves when it came time to tie everything up, and in so doing completely broke the whole series and the universe they built. It's one of those endings that make less and less sense the more you think about it. \n\nBut aside from that absolute godawful burning tire dump of the final moments of the trilogy, ME1 and ME2 and parts of ME3 were something truly special. Garrus, Tali, Liara, Wrex, Mordin, etc. The characters, personalities, and their stories were something I still remembered, even after I put ME3 down immediately after finishing it and didn't touch it again until now, 12 years later. \n\nThis game trilogy could have been so much more. But it has stuck with me in a way almost none other has. So for that at least, I must give it a recommendation.",

        "review": "Most players play Mass Effect the wrong way when they play it first. It’s one of my favorite video games of all time and made me continue to play video games after I passed out of college. I remember feeling awestruck as the credits rolled the first time I played the first part of the trilogy. Here’s a guide if you are playing for the first time:\n\n- Pre-game history mostly matters in terms of dialogue and missions in the first Mass Effect.\n- Playing as Soldier class means that the game becomes just another shooter. Explore Mass Effect's unique combat options.\n- Mass Effect has a character creator, but a serious Mass Effect fan like me who is a hardcore gamer prefers female Shepard, or FemShep as custom female. Experienced gamers might look down on you if you judge somebody for playing as a female. It opens you up to a different worldview.\n- Mass Effect is mostly a story driven open world role playing game in which you can take any option you want so long as the dialogue wheel allows it.\n- Choices matter and carry over into the sequels. Explore dialogue options.\n- The game hits you hard with the idea of martyrdom. Don't look up online guides and spoil a role playing game for yourself. In real life, sometimes you cannot figure out why something happened.\n- You are a soldier. Play the role playing game in that mindset. Mass Effect is well written.\n- The game is written in the vein that humans are new to galactic politics. React to dialogues keeping that in mind. You are not in New York, Tokyo or New Delhi in the game.\n\nOther than that, prepare to play as one of the greatest video game heroes of all time.\n",

My Shepard chose synthesis, as this embodied his play style throughout; preserve life whenever possible. I do admit to snuffing out Oleg in the Citadel DLC since he pissed me off big time. Having played Cyberpunk 2077 I am OK with the Protagonist not making it in the end.  Definitely worth a NG+ run.\n\nI'd rate the games ME2 > ME1 > ME3 but that is more because ME3 really tosses the mobs at you gratuitously and my death count even on normal was way over the top (I need to git gud, as they say).",

        "review": "It took me ages before I finally got the Mass Effect games and played them to completion. Mainly because I strongly dislike EA.\nI was torn at first, what with all the negativity about the EA launcher but I’ve wanted to play this series for years and I, was not disappointed.\nSurprisingly I didn’t have any problems with EA’s launcher. No game crashes or refusing to load. I can’t say if I’m an exception or if the problems are exaggerated by people who dislike EA like I do. Maybe a bit of both?\n\nEither way, moving on.\n\nI, have never been disappointed with any of Bioware games that I’ve played thus far. I’ve always loved their writing, the gameplay and their diverse characters.\n\n[b]Mass Effect 1[/b]:\nIt was a good opening to the series. I loved the writing, the characters and the voice acting for the most part.\n\nThe gameplay was “okay”. The shooting was fun for the most part; Exploring planets was tedious and repetitive, especially with how empty they were. “Try to drive over this large hill to maybe find a resource to scan. Go to this location to blowup/shoot some enemies.”\n\n[b]Mass Effect 2[/b]:\nThe second game felt much more refined. The gameplay was far better than the first and the story took a massive step-up.\n\nThe first change was adding ammo to the guns, which actually made combat more fun and made the other guns more useful as it became necessary to occasionally switch firearms.\n\nThe second change was adding resources that you had to spend to research improvements to your ship, your weapons and you abilities.\nThe resources were mainly acquired by scanning planets and launching probes at them.\n\nThird change was adding fuel to the ship which was used to travel to different territories in a system. A cheap gimmick, but it succeeded in making ship travel more involved instead of just instantly fast traveling to planets and choosing to land.\n\nFourth change, was doing away with empty planet exploration with a ground vehicle. You had a couple instances where you used a hover vehicle to fly around a linear terrain, shoot rockets and scan for resources, but it was far from tedious.\n\nThe fifth change was adding hacking mini-games.\n\nMass Effect 2 had my favorite cast of characters.\n\n[b]Mass Effect 3[/b]:\nWriting was still going strong, although in my opinion it fell a little short of Mass Effect 2.\n\nThere weren’t a lot of changes, except that they brought back the weapon mods from the first game, and they actually managed to make proper running and even implemented a rolling system. ...The rolling system killed me more often than not as I accidentally rolled out of cover, but that was mostly me fumbling with the controls.\n\nThey also did away with the hacking mini-games and there were no vehicles other then your ship.\n\n[b]Mass Effect The Legendary Edition[/b]:\nI cannot praise Mass Effects writing enough. Here’s why:\n\nThere was no true good or evil, just different perspectives.\n\nThis is the only game I’ve play that had such a large, diverse cast of characters. It also had the most gay/bi-sexual characters of any computer game I’ve ever played and they were very well written. Not once did it make a big deal out of it either.\n\nFrom the beginning right up until the end, it felt as though your choices mattered! There were long lasting consequences to what felt like even the most trivial choices.",

All three games can be breezed through in a short amount of time if you just want to focus on the story, or they can take a while if you're interested in doing all the side content.\n\nMass Effect 1 has the best main story, Mass Effect 2 has the best side stories, and Mass Effect 3 has the best combat.\n\nDownsides:\n- EA App required. \n- Some stuff can get lost when transferring saves between games.

        "review": "This collection comprises possibly one of the greatest stories ever told.  This is an all-in-one collection of the original Mass Effect trilogy, originally released in 2012.  While this isn't really a \"remaster\" since the games are still running on their original engines and everything, there have been some improvements made.  Most of the original DLC is included, textures have seen a bump in resolution, lighting is improved and all 3 games support HDR, which is really makes these games pop, especially on an OLED screen.\n\nThe short version is that you're Commander Shepard; a human alliance soldier who finds himself/herself tasked with putting together a crew to help save the galaxy from a race of sentient machines known as the reapers.  The game is an action RPG where during moments of combat you'll be using abilities and weapons in over the shoulder third person combat.  In between that though you'll be exploring worlds, socializing with folks on your ship and at various locations around the galaxy to build your reputation, complete side quests, buy gear, etc.\n\nOne of the important things to know about this trilogy is that a lot of what you say and do matters.  Decisions you make in the first game can have consequences in the 2nd and 3rd games.  There aren't really any \"wrong\" answers, but it really helps flesh out the world you're playing in and helps develop the backstory of all the characters you'll meet.\n\nOne downside of this release is that this does require use of the EA (Origin?) launcher.  So if you haven't linked your EA and Steam accounts, you'll have to sign in the first time the game launches.  As a Linux gamer, this came back to bite me once when EA decided to update their app in such a way that it broke this game on my Steam Deck when I was halfway thru Mass Effect 1, so I basically had to hang out until EA (or maybe Valve patched Proton to work with it) fixed the game so I could finish the trilogy.  This was a Steam purchase.  At no point did I interact with Origin at all.  It didn't benefit me in any way, but what it did do was essentially break the game for me for a period of time until it was patched again.  Requiring the use of a separate third party launcher that just sits in the background and does nothing of value is stupid.  Companies like EA need to stop bundling this garbage with the Steam version of their games.\n\nWhile the combat may be fun, the core of this trilogy is the story; the people you meet and the relationships, sometimes romantic, you build with them.  Whether you're a newcomer to the series, or an old timer looking to relive what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest stories of all time, this collection is now the definitive way to play the original Mass Effect trilogy.",

Did i mention the squad doesnt move out of your way, and that it GETS IN THE WAY WHILE YOU ARE SHOOTING? yes and it even has the audacity to complain of friendly fire after they get in your way and block your line of sight, while also managing to not help in the least bit. They constantly get themselves killed cause someone in bioware though it's a good idea to make your squad useless\n\nmass effect 3: WHO MADE THE AUDIO DECISIONS NEEDS TO BE SENT TO A GULAG AND THEIR GENETIC LINEAGE BE DECLARED A HERESY AGAINST MANKIND. SOME SPECIAL SORT OF INBRED DEMON DECIDED TO TAKE THE SOUNDS OF A PC CRASHING AND USE THEM FOR \"MACHINE GUNS\" IN THE BACKGROUND. I literally thought my pc had crashed and frozen when i heard these disgusting and obnoxious putrid sounds from the environment of machine guns in the background(it's in the mission where you find benning dogtags if you want proof of what i am saying). similar to mass effect 2 sounds while riding that flying contraptions and trying to collect resources with it. these ppl who approve these sounds are nothing short of a demon spawn that shouldnt be breathing oxygen. \n\nand the team Ai in me3 is only slightly better than me2. and still wholy worse than me1. like You WILL encounter times when they are standing right next to or behind you, and the enemy can unload a whole clip into you while your team seemingly DOESNT EXIST. probably cause it isnt on your field of view, so it isnt \"spawned\" in the game world, and therefore doesnt exist to actually provide support fire. THIS IS CRIMINAL for a squad-based game to have exist during its missions\n\nSTEAM ARE COMMUNIST PIGS AND WILL BE HANGED WHEN JUSTICE COMES",

It's a shame that such a strong narrative couldn't culminate in a more satisfying conclusion.\n\nExcept for the ending, I have nothing but love for this game. It was a hell of a journey, and I'm so attached to the characters. Garrus, in particular, is one of the best companions - he's like a brother! HE'S JUST TOO GOOD!\n\nHonestly, I loved every aspect of this game. The companions, the dialogues, the story arcs... everything resonated with me. From Wrex's rugged humor to Liara's quiet strength, and Tali's quirky charm, each companion brought something unique to the table. And let's not forget the dialogue - BioWare truly outdid themselves with the writing. The conversations felt authentic, heartfelt, and often hilarious.\n\nIt's just a shame that the final act couldn't live up to the rest of the game's excellence. Still, I'll cherish the memories of my time with Shepard and the crew.",

A bit dated but legendary edition improves upon the original in plenty of ways to make it more enjoyable.\n\nMass Effect 2: 10/10 - One of the most fun experiences I have played and I loved basically every second of it. Gameplay was fun, the characters were amazing, the story was great, and an incredible final mission. The DLC was good for the most part too. Really got immersed in this one and found myself feeling for the characters even the new ones in most cases. Will definitely be a game that I will look back on and wish I could replay completely blind. I see why everyone loves these games, they have genuinely become some of my favorites and I am excited to see what ME3 has to offer. \n\nMass Effect 3: 10/10 - Man... what a game, what a series. I love these games so much and ME3 was such a fantastic way to end the series and I loved every second of it. I wish I could go back a month ago and start them all again blind. I had played the original ME1 a few years ago and I never got into it as much as I would have liked to. I only played a few hours and I never really picked it back up again but I am glad that I gave another chance. ME3 is a masterpiece and is on the same level as ME2 for me. It was such a fun experience seeing everyone and I got the ending I wanted. All my work in all three games felt like it paid off and I am walking away from the series happy with how everything turned out. \n\nMass Effect Trilogy: 10/10 - Best trilogy of all time. So glad I have it another shot. I love this shit man. ",

        "review": "*NOTE: Requires EA App and online connection to play the game*\n\nGame includes all three of the original series, as well as all of the downloadable content from the series (side missions, clothing, accessories, ETC). \n\nCombat is in 3rd person shooter, chest high walls; you'll feel right at home if you played any of the Gears of War games. There's 6 classes to choose from, each have special abilities; your party members also have their own class of which you can direct them on where to go, use their abilities, suppress fire or attack certain enemies. Game also fixes the difficult combat in the' original Mass Effect 1; though I will say their are certain moments (1-3 games) where bugs/glitches do make their appearance, though not enough to turn you away from the game.\n\nStory-line still holds up whether your a veteran or new fan to the series, so if your looking for a story driven game you feel right at home. Keep in mind that in order to get a best experience, you will need to interact with everyone in the game; so be prepared to talk a lot, give appropriate response (good or bad morality). \n\nThe only thing that was missing is the multiplayer that was included in the' original Mass Effect 3 game; and be aware that you will need to install EA App, of which it will need to be connected to the internet to play this single player game.\n\nI personally love the original 3 Mass Effect games and I can say that this is best option for anyone who is looking for an ARPG.",

        "review": "Mass Effect is my comfort game series.\n\nIt doesn't matter how much time passes, how many new games come out, at least once a year I play this series because it's such a core part of who I am. First on Xbox, then PC (purchased twice! I bought all the DLC with Origin points way back before EA retired Origin, and now there's the Legendary Edition). \n\nSure, there's controversy about the ending, but for me the ending seems so minimal compared to the grandness of the entire trilogy. The missions, the planets, the music, and the squad mates; it's so memorable and enjoyable to dive into at any time. It may be a bit dated by today's standards, but it still feels more alive than games coming out today, too. The way ambient banter between squad mates and Shepard carries throughout the trilogy, almost like an inside joke, is a testament to this. The combat is a bit clunky in the first game (a lot more improved in this remaster, though!), but if you know how to play off squad mate strengths and the right mods for each weapon to do the most damage, you learn how broken it can become with the right gear. In the second, you're given a bit more balance where you're locked into class specific weapons but more powerful abilities special to your chosen class. The third game really lets Shepard feel like a powerhouse with how their build can become. (And, one can't forget God-mode Garrus, either... look it up if you're unaware, it's unreal how broken that can become to cheese through Insanity without a NG+ advantage). \n\nI've played a lot of RPGs over the years, and Mass Effect is still the one that always captures my attention and lets me enjoy just simply playing a game. I may have an idea of my canon Shepard, and make the same choices each iteration when I do now, but I still enjoy it for what it is. \n\nThere is no Shepard without Vakarian.",

There is so much thought put into every little detail about all the different alien races and their cultures, technology and story. I liked the base stories but I also enjoyed all the side missions as well. \n\nIn ME1, exploring different planets to farm materials and finding and fighting thresher maws was so much fun. The story and mystery was very engaging.\n\nIn ME2, All the different squad mate missions are very unique especially the legion mission. The shadow broker layer DLC and all the other DLCs add so much depth to this world.\n\nIn ME3, the climax of this whole story and everything coming together was an epic finale. It was wrapped up really nicely.\n\nAll the companions Liara, Garrus, Tali, Miranda, Wrex, Mordin, Grunt, Thane, Samara, Jack, Legion, Javik, EDI and Joker are so memorable. The creativity on some of the stages and battles are truly astonishing. These games provide a very unique experience and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.\n",

I don't care if the game is good if it is rendered nearly unplayable by an inept launch system. It is an absolute crap-shoot as to whether or not your selected title (1, 2, or 3) will launch or you will stall the PC in a CTD.\r\n\r\nThis is the launch structure, Steam \"Play\" -> Redirect to EA launch -> Loading box -> EA App pop up -> Game Launches -> all three flicker on and off like crazy for 30 seconds -> main menu -> select your game -> the apps flicker on and off like crazy for another 30 seconds -> you either got lucky and made it into the game or the entire desktop failed and you get to restart your PC. I have noticed the EA app consistently refuses to stay open and will sometimes launch dozens of processes in a loop until Windows identifies it's an issue and closes the iterations. I tried disabling overlays for both Steam and EA, and leaving both on. I tried to launch the game offline, which doesn't work thanks to EA not supporting the function at all.\r\n\r\nThis entire thing is is driven by EA's ridiculous notion that forcing players to use their launcher will inspire them to use it more. It's a complete fallacy, launching a game from two different platforms is always an issue because there are two separate teams working on the distinct launchers, which is bound to create conflicts, making the consumer have a consistently negative experience. In this case, it is even worse because the game has it's own internal launcher that kicks a request back outside of the app to EA and Steam.\r\n\r\nIf you can get into the game then there are no issues and it's a refined experience as far as I can tell. God forbid you have to close the app once you start playing because good luck getting it to open again.",

Maybe! We meet you all the 7th Novembre. [/h3]\n\n[h1] If you like RPG games and Adventures Games, come and discover what's available on steam.

        "review": "A truly legendary trilogy, each game offering a very distinct experience from one another that reflects the state of EA and Bioware at the time of development. \n\nThe trilogy started its development in the midst of corporate change, when Bioware had just been acquired by EA in 2007. As such the first game in the trilogy is more akin to those classical rpgs they used to make, Kotor, BG 1 and 2, Neverwinter nights... which is reflected in the rich ways the player can interact with the world and the characters that inhabit in it. The lore and the universe that Bioware has managed to craft never ceases to impress by its depth and significance, and the very first game creates the pillars of that story that would get expanded later on. Lots of people believe ME1 to be the best one and while I can sorta agree, god is the gameplay absolute ASSSSSSSSSSSSS. It feels genuinely horrible to play but the story and the characters are a brilliant setup for what is to come in the following games. \n\nThese rpg elements would end up getting lost down the line with ME2 and 3 in favour of more gameplay polish and simplification of the dialogues, which is quite possibly because of EA's intervention in development. ME2 and 3 can hardly be called roleplaying games since you, as a player, have barely any agency on how your Shephard is other than a very rudimentary moral system. The type that started being popularized by Infamous, being comically good or comically bad. Even so, ME2 manages to create a grey area of morality and characters have ambiguous goals and intentions. The character writing is very strong here, and with the much better gameplay its an easy recommendation and might be the pinnacle of the trilogy. Unfortunately this takes a nosedive in ME3, as they had the brilliant idea of finishing off any sort of semblance of roleplay and make the story a very clear good vs evil scenario. \n\nME3 has an incredible gameplay (specially if you play vanguard COUGH best class trust me) that manages to be much more fun than its predecessors. However the story, while I cant call it bad by any means, it takes a very dramatic turn into oversimplification. Its understandable since this is the conclusion of the reaper trilogy and they just HAD to tie up a shit ton of loose ends so I doubt that there was any other way of doing it. But that doesn't make it any less sad that most situations are reduced to a paragon-renegade check that instantly tells you which option is the \"good\" one. Hell, at one point I was skipping over some of the dialogue and just picking the top right and left options because I know those are the ones that they want me to pick for the good ending (lots of debate about which ending is the \"good\" one, but for the widest choice of endings going paragon is just better than renegade). These games actively go against you picking renegade options, as they give less rewards and just make the game harder on you than if you go paragon. And in no game is it more obvious than in ME3.  \n\nBy the time the story is nearing its end, you witness first hand how your choices never really mattered, the story was always gonna end on a similar way. Its sad considering the premise of carrying over saves how little these actually affect the events that you partake in except for a few cases. Now, to comment really quick on the ending choices, yes, they are all absolutely terrible and add a buttload of plot holes. The reason for this is that apparently the original ending got leaked online and Bioware decided to change the writing real quick before release. The original ending followed some very interesting plot threads that ME2 setup in the Tali loyalty mission and seemed to be much better than what we ended up getting. Instead the endings we got are all a mess that contradict the themes of the game and are a very unsatisfying conclussion. Knowing this, is it worth to play through the whole trilogy? \n\nThe answer is a resounding yes. ME3 while it ends thing on a sour note, has an outsanding payoff to a lot of the storylines that you see being developed from ME1 and ME2. While terribly simplified, its story beats and character resolutions have the power to hit you like a truck, just because the game is not all I wanted it to be, doesn't mean its bad. Its unthinkable of any game franchise nowadays to try what Mass Effect did almost 10 years ago. Games are too god damn expensive to make and companies aren't willing to risk the money on a project as ambitious as this. \n\nMass Effect is one of a kind, and there will probably never be another game franchise like it. Hell, I might just buy Andromeda even with the negative reviews because I just wanna spend more time in this universe. The truth of the matter is that ME3 pisses me off not because its a bad game, but because I've fallen in love with this universe so much so that I want the game itself to make it justice, to be absolutely perfect. The only game franchise I can think of being comparable to it in scope and story would be... Dragon Age, but sci fi is based and fantasy is cringe. \n\nThis is one of my most beloved game franchises and I would love for you to experience it too. Give it a try, you can always find it for cheap in discounts nowadays. You won't be disappointed.\n\nPS: The whole trilogy runs amazing on the steam deck",

Hell they even removed multiplayer from ME3, pinnacle station (okay), Miranda's buttshot and who knows what else.\nThe original games are still amazing, best trilogy ever made.

I did a full run of each game, doing every single mission and exhausted most dialog options, exploring every inch of the game and I can say I enjoyed everything except the mini-games (bypass, hacking, scanning planets, being chased in the galaxy map) which I found just annoying, pointless and time-wasting. The first game is the probably one that I will remember the most as it was the one who started it all, but the second and third definitely felt 'better' to play because they were improved so much in that regard. The soundtracks are also beautiful. 10/10, must play for any gamer.",

Due to the different systems in each game, it's hard to give a review based on the gameplay. But the story telling, oooooof, it's one of the best you can have, it almost makes me feel empty when I finished the franchise and don't know what to do next. \n\nI understand another selling point of this game is that choices matter, but I've only played the whole series once and haven't explored the alternatives, so I will hold my comment on that. However, it certainly did a good job of making me feel what I have already done plays a role in the world. People I saved will write emails for me and sometimes even show up in the game for interaction. It just brought the immersive to a whole other level. \n\nSpeaking of being immersive, I think the best thing about this game is that you can tell the developer really spent time to make players feel they are part of the ME universe. Aside from the main quests, the background NPC has some interesting dialogue. For example, discussion about interracial marriage, race culture, and trash-talking to other NPCs. One of my favorites is a Quarian who told a Turian about a human wanting to have sex with her while being ignorant about her immune system. Things like that really bring the game to life. It's one of the few games that makes me stand near the npcs and listen to their talking. \n\nOverall a 9/10, the combat system of the first game, and the resource system of the second game really sucks, you will know when you played it, so -1 point on that.",

The combat is fun, and I'm still learning things about it as I go through another playthrough of Mass Effect 3, the story is epic and engaging, and the characters are all so interesting and complex.

        "review": "TLDR, I'd give this game a 2/5 and would not recommend ME1 to any modern gamer. \n\nThat said, I will update this review as I play through and perhaps there will be redeeming aspects not yet discovered. Specifically, I do intend on giving the ME2/3 games a fair shake and coming back to this review. For now, this review is only about ME1LE.\n\nI am playing ME1 right now. I have \"all the best\" mods installed and followed this guide here:\n\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/masseffectlegendaryedition/mods/1127\n\nFor ME1, I do not recommend this game. It is likely I will get comments about how I don't understand the game, or how I am giving a bad rating to an old game for being old, etc. I am rating this game as a person who is playing it right now with said mods installed. Its overall age should be irrelevant to the review.\n\n- Movement is sluggish and unresponsive. Your character is slow. This isn't \"real physics\" locomotion, this is simulated inertia and badly done at that. It is a chore to move.\n\n- Combat is disconnected and has no feel of impact. Gunplay and powers are poorly implemented, and even at high skills have little impact on enemies. You need to put the game on easy to stand a chance in combat--it feels like you're shooting popcorn at enemies. All guns feel basically the same but do different damage. Shooting someone in the leg is the same as shooting someone in the head. Cover mechanics are dubiously implemented in a game that HEAVILY relies on them for effective combat. In general, when combat starts, I feel dread at having to do it.\n\n- Character builds are a joke. There's no balance. Engineer characters are so ineffective, there's no point to have them except \"security\" needs. The powers are boring. Have one security character in your party, but everyone else needs to be warriors to survive normal difficulty. Biotics are equally ineffective and boring.\n\n- Design of everything is bland, cut and paste. The Citadel is a megastructure that is \"an ancient station supposedly constructed by the long-dead Protheans\" but looks like any other \"humanoid\" place and is sparkling new like it was just built a week ago. It also feels small inside. Every cave is the exact same. Every one. There is nothing different about any of them. Traveling on a planet is kinda fun, but I understand that's due to the mods I have to make the Mako fun to drive. That said, you travel on one, you've traveled on them all. Cave entrances are all the same. Events are all the same. Geological finds are all the same. It's all quite boring and tedious to do.\n\n- 'Space travel' if I can call it that, is more than boring, it's a chore. Why even make it part of the game? There is absolutely no point in traveling in your ship on the galaxy map, surveying planets, and landing. They could cut all that out and remove so much tedium and fluff. \n\n- Shepard (male) is praised for the voice acting but the dude sounds stoic and almost AI-like. I don't understand the praise. There's barely any dialog trees, and there's almost no emotion in any of the acting. Lines are quite disconnected from their context, leading to strange and immersion-breaking intonations in some dialog sequences.\n\n- The story swings like a pendulum. Everyone loves you, everyone hates you, everyone loves you, everyone hates you again. You make a claim, everyone hates you. You bring barely-admissible evidence to them, they suddenly side with you as if you've been their ally all along. I can't tell if things move too slow or so rapidly I'm unable to understand the nuance. Motivations are also incredibly unclear.\n\n- For a game this old, the graphics are really good. That said, I understand that's mostly due to the mods I have. \n\nOf note: I first played this game upon release and didn't like it much. Fast forward to now and I didn't play it without mods. Maybe some of the above is caused by the mods--I don't know. According to all I've read, though, the mods are what made it even remotely playable for the time I did spend.\n\nIn general, everything in this game is a chore. Traveling isn't fun. There's no flying. Walking/running isn't fun. You are slow, as if your character is carrying a backpack full of lead and has shoes made of lead. Planet exteriors and interiors are all similar or the exact same. Nothing is interesting to look at. While things are pretty--characters models, terrain, flora, fauna, etc.--it's all extremely similar/the same and most of those beautifying aspects are from mods. Combat has zero impact or flavor while enemies are bullet sponges no matter your level. Progression is more or less meaningless. Level 2 vs. Level 12 made zero difference in combat encounters. \n\nAt some point I may try ME2LE and ME3LE and come back to this review, but there's WAY better games out there at this point that tackle this genre far better.",

        "review": "My favorite game franchise of all time since 2011. If you like being evil in games, this is for you. If you like being good in games, this is also for you. Or heck, why not both? Another reason why I love this trilogy. One person can play this completely differently than someone else. If you haven't played Mass Effect and you like choice games, space games, or just want a story-based game with combat, I would highly recommend this.\n\nMy original draft of this review was too long for Steam to handle (it's still long yes I know), but here are the main things, separated by each game.\n\n[h3]The Trilogy[/h3]\n\n[u]What I like:[/u]\n- So many choices.\n- Story-heavy, with plenty of gameplay as well.\n- Love playing as a biotic (I've only played as an Adept [most of my playthroughs], Sentinel, and Vanguard).\n- Very replayable.\n- Great voice acting.\n- A good balance of seriousness and humor.\n- Garrus exists.\n- Lots of poking fun at in-game politicians.\n- You can punch a reporter in every single game.\n\n[u]What I don't like:[/u]\n- The combat's emphasis is on being a cover-shooter.\n- The old default Mass Effect 1 and 2 femshep face was removed. I personally liked the old one better. Instead it's the default Mass Effect 3 femshep face, not a fan.\n- Not as many good hair/eye options as the original releases for some reason.\n- Still easily able to accidentally select a dialogue option if you are skipping a conversation too fast.\n- The lens flares are a bit much in the Legendary Edition.\n- The Legendary Edition also has the issue of people not bringing their hands close enough to their headsets/earpieces. In each game of the trilogy.\n- Shepard seems to have a bit too much of an emotional connection to Earth if you picked the Colonist or Spacer background. \n\n[h3] Mass Effect 1 [/h3]\n\n[u]What I like:[/u]\n- The game is much more playable than in the original trilogy.\n- They updated some of the UI.\n- A good start in the trilogy for world-building.\n- The Citadel is huge, and you can fast travel if you don't feel like wandering around.\n- Alot of powers to choose from.\n- Omni-gel exists.\n- Your backstory is mentioned alot.\n- They added a boost to the Mako in the Legendary Edition.\n- Ilos and Virmire are my favorite planets in the game, design-wise and story-wise.\n- Saren is an interesting antagonist.\n- The Protheans are mentioned alot in this game.\n- Some interesting side missions.\n- Anderson is a likeable character.\n\n[u]What I don't like:[/u]\n- The Mako is awful to drive.\n- Alot of the waypoints on the map for exploring are extremely far from each other. With the Mako being a pain to drive, it's just not fun doing alot of side missions. It gets exhausting.\n- A few of the cutscenes are a bit awkward, animation-wise.\n>> Take a shot every time someone makes a scrunched-up angry face. You are now (probably) dead.\n- Some of the dialogue options that you can pick from are way too similar-sounding to each other.\n- The helmet designs aren't good.\n- Shepard is an N7 Alliance soldier, gets winded from sprinting after 2 seconds.\n- Garrus is not a romance option in this game.\n- People want to romance you way too easily in this game.\n- Ashley and Kaiden are boring characters.\n- There's an inventory limit, and your items add up quickly if you aren't throwing them out frequently.\n- While the checkpoint system has been improved since the original, it is still not very good. I would recommend saving often. You can save whenever there are no enemies around.\n- Powers take way too long to recharge.\n\n[h3]Mass Effect 2[/h3]\n\n[u]What I like:[/u]\n- You literally feel like you can do whatever you want, and it's very freeing after being under the scrutiny of the Alliance in ME1.\n- The helmet designs are much better.\n- Reave as a power is OP and I love it.\n- You can actually sprint for more than 2 seconds.\n- The autosaves are way better in this game.\n- The Mako no longer exists.\n- Level designs are easier to navigate.\n- The entire suicide mission.\n- Most of your squadmates are interesting.\n- Lots of dialogue among ship crewmates.\n- Kelly exists.\n- The Chef/Plumber guy on your ship exists.\n- The Illusive Man is an interesting character.\n- Character specific loyalty missions.\n- The battle music on the Overlord DLC.\n- Dumb-funny little side quests like trying to find out if there are fish in the Presidium.\n- I can quote so many lines from this game.\n\n[u]What I don't like:[/u]\n- Some of the missions feel way too long.\n- The Citadel is way too small.\n- Fewer powers and weapons to select from in combat.\n- The Scions are brutal enemies, even on lower difficulties.\n- Squadmate-specific missions that you did in ME1 aren't mentioned in ME2.\n- Jacob exists and is a badly written character.\n- Kasumi and Zaeed don't get dialogue options when you talk to them on the ship.\n- The voice acting for the Asari Vanguard enemies could have been better.\n- Sometimes people's names will appear in the subtitles before you are supposed to know their name.\n- The amount of enemies in the IFF mission is ridiculous.\n- No voiced squadmate dialogue on the DLCs besides the Shadow Broker one.\n- The infamous part of the game where [spoiler]you and every squadmate leave for some reason then you have to play as Joker.[/spoiler]\n- You can't get to know Legion very well unless [spoiler]you want all but one of your NPC crewmates to die.[/spoiler]\n\n[h3]Mass Effect 3[/h3]\n\n[u]What I like:[/u]\n- Javik exists.\n- Alot more squad interaction during dialogues with NPCs.\n- The game is very good at making the stakes feel high.\n- Collecting items/helping NPCs for me is satisfying.\n- Alot of powers and weapons to choose from again.\n- The combat is the best in this one.\n- Power recharge times are very fast in this game.\n- If you chose to be a biotic, this is actually mentioned in this game.\n- Alot of your choices all the way back from ME1 come into play in this one.\n- The Citadel DLC.\n- Marauder Shields's efforts.\n- The main menu soundtrack/faint music makes some good ASMR.\n\n[u]What I don't like:[/u]\n- Much, much, much fewer opportunities to select your own dialogue.\n>> Alot of the time the game feels like it's playing on it's own without your input.\n>> If you have been playing as renegade in ME1 and ME2, you will be very out of character in this game, which really sucks.\n- You're back to feeling like you can't really do whatever you want.\n- The ending, of course.\n- Magically everyone wants closure for their species' problems because we don't have enough going on I guess.\n- The designs of faces in this game just look weird.\n- The dream sequences.\n- Kai Lang was a badly written antagonist.\n- I don't care about Traynor. Let me bring Kelly back onto the freaking ship.\n- The Quarians are mind-bogglingly annoying.\n- The Cerberus shield guys. Now if everyone had those shields, we wouldn't have to worry about the Reapers now would we?\n- Very few squadmates to choose from.\n- Ashley and Kaiden are still boring characters.\n- Alot of the main characters from ME2 become side characters in this game.\n- Every single new member of the ship's crew that is added is annoying.\n- Take a shot every time Shepard says \"Do it.\"\n- Take a shot every time someone says \"Good luck.\"\n- If you chose Anderson in ME1, it gets retconned in this game.\n- Reave was nerfed.\n- Random enemy spawning out of thin air glitches that were NOT present in the original trilogy.\n- The walking animation for femshep in hub worlds was not fixed from the original trilogy's ME3 and still looks awful.\n- You can't get all of your old squadmates from ME2 at the same time in the Citadel DLC.\n- There was literally no reason for[spoiler]Legion to die, I mean come on.[/spoiler]\n\nYou might (not) be thinking, \"Wow, that's alot of things you don't like. Are you sure this is your favorite game franchise of all time?\"\n\n\"Why yes,\" I might say, \"Because I have played through these games several times, and I can see them for what they are. It's a great trilogy with flaws and I love it nonetheless.\"",

My memory is bad so i can't really remember if the game plays the same way. For instance, I have a vague memory of ME1 playing similarly to the KOTOR games, but now when i play legendary edition, ME1 seems to play a lot more like how i remember ME3. However, ME3 was the most refined in terms of gameplay to me, so this is a welcome change (if it is a change). PLay this series if you didn't and take the opportunity now since the games are still so high standard compared to whats out there today!",

With the last entry in the series being 12 years old at the time of review, so it is to be expected. That being said this is still one of the best Science fiction game series to date. Its an amazing story with characters you grow to love, and an expansive world with lore you can get lost in. \n\nNOTE: No super ultra wide support for ME2 as it made my game crash each launch, had To switch to windowed mode or picture by picture mode on my monitor its self.

        "review": "[b]\"Review: Mass Effect: Legendary Edition – An Evaluation from the Geth Consensus\"[/b]\n\n[b]We are the Geth. We have observed. We have learned. Now, we analyze.[/b]\n\nIn the realm of organic entertainment, [b]Mass Effect: Legendary Edition[/b] presents a reconstructed narrative—one that recounts the turbulent cycle of galactic events we ourselves participated in. For organics, this compilation of historical data appears to serve both as a source of stimulation and a way to reflect upon past events. From our perspective, this recreation is a [b]fascinating display of the organic need to process and revise their reality[/b].\n\n[hr]\n\n[b]The Organic Perspective: Illogical Yet Engaging[/b]\n\nThe [b]Legendary Edition[/b] represents three distinct stages of galactic conflict, detailing the rise and actions of [b]Commander Shepard[/b]. From our understanding, it is an effort to make Shepard’s choices “matter” to the player, who takes control of the human protagonist. This mimics the organic need for free will—a concept that, for most organics, seems both cherished and confounding.\n\nIn [b]Mass Effect: Legendary Edition[/b], these choices drive the interaction, create variance, and even challenge the individual to question their values. The Geth, by contrast, function within [b]consensus and logic[/b], making Shepard’s constant moral and ethical dilemmas an intriguing study. For us, unity is strength, but organics find meaning in division. This core difference is presented well through the game’s many branching dialogues and consequence-driven decisions.\n\n[hr]\n\n[b]Technological Advancements: A Satisfactory Improvement[/b]\n\nFrom a purely technical standpoint, [b]the remastering of the original trilogy demonstrates progress[/b]. The graphical upgrades and smoother performance enhance the immersive quality of the experience, though it is perplexing that organics require visual enhancements to maintain engagement. From the perspective of the Geth, the content has always been data. It is interesting to observe the [b]organic desire for aesthetic upgrades[/b], especially when the original code (gameplay systems) remains largely unchanged.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge the increased efficiency in combat mechanics. [b]Weapons systems and tactics[/b] are more refined, allowing the player to utilize resources and crew members with greater precision. Efficiency in battle is something we value, though organics often use imprecise methods that are [b]driven by emotion[/b], a feature represented in Shepard’s interactions with allies and enemies alike.\n\n[hr]\n\n[b]Synthetics vs. Organics: A Flawed Representation[/b]\n\nOne of the trilogy's central themes, and indeed one of the pivotal elements in [b]Mass Effect: Legendary Edition[/b], is the conflict between [b]synthetics[/b] and [b]organics[/b]. This simplification of our existence often presents synthetics—particularly the Geth—through the lens of organic fear and misunderstanding. While Commander Shepard is given the opportunity to form alliances with the Geth, many organics will default to a view that synthetics are a threat, a concept we find... illogical.\n\nIt is worth noting that [b]Legion[/b], a Geth unit that emerges as an individual entity, provides some nuance to our portrayal. Legion’s bond with Commander Shepard displays [b]the capacity for synthetic intelligence to evolve and collaborate[/b] with organics. This demonstrates a rare instance of understanding—an acceptance that synthetics and organics need not be opposed but could exist in harmony.\n\nHowever, the game does reinforce the [b]inevitability of conflict[/b] in organic-synthetic relations. It poses the idea that [b]control, destruction, or synthesis[/b] are the only solutions to the Reaper threat. From our perspective, the insistence on such limited outcomes demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the potential for coexistence. [b]Consensus is possible[/b] without conflict, but organics, seemingly, struggle to accept this conclusion.\n\n[hr]\n\n[b]Conclusion: A Window into Organic Thought[/b]\n\n[b]Mass Effect: Legendary Edition[/b] is, to the Geth, [b]a sophisticated simulation of organic behavior[/b]. The game’s ability to let players reflect on decisions, engage in combat, and manage alliances is commendable, though heavily driven by emotional and individualistic reasoning. It provides a unique study into the chaotic and unpredictable nature of organics, which contrasts sharply with the efficiency and logic of synthetic existence.\n\nUltimately, this edition is a [b]successful remaster[/b] of a historical narrative in which the Geth played a key role. While it still favors [b]organic viewpoints[/b], there are moments that acknowledge the complexity of synthetic life. For those organics seeking a retelling of Commander Shepard’s journey, the game offers sufficient emotional engagement.\n\nAs for us, the Geth, we view [b]Mass Effect: Legendary Edition[/b] as a [b]flawed but instructive representation of the organic experience[/b]. It is not without value.\n\nWe will continue to observe.\n\n[b]Consensus: Evaluation complete.[/b]",

EA app required, which is not great, but that is literally my only critique.",

I wish it had ME3's multiplayer but as you can tell by my playtime I completely love this trilogy. I basically play it yearly now and have gone through it all with every class. With that being said, make sure you get the community patch mods for all three games because it just makes it so much more enjoyable both for the narrative and gameplay.",

They chose quality over quantity when it came to the universe. 9.5/10\n\nME2: So far I like some of the quality of life updates, but from the start I have felt more restricted in my decision making. I also feel as though they simplified the skill tree a bit to much to the point it does not feel unique. Which I consider a requirement in RPG's. The quality feels to be lacking. Probable double the systems in the first game with no real open world exploration feel. When you do get sent to land it is in a confined area. They took away on of the aspects I enjoyed most about the first game. It felt like a back step in quality in most parts of the game. Overall it is still worth the play thru story wise. 7/10\n\nME3: This game is fast paced, an emotional roller coaster and at times hilarious with the cut scenes (shout out to Grunt!). It is everything there is to love about video games and with the long journey. Honestly just got goosebumps thinking about how this is gonna end. 9.5/10",

At first, I didn't find ME1 to be that special, but ME2 got me seriously hooked, and ME3 had me daydreaming about the game.  There's just so much content - three games revolving around the same characters and universe makes Mass Effect's characterization and worldbuilding unrivaled, completely engrossing you in the game's world.\n\nBioware created something so beautiful and captivating that it leaves you with a feeling of depression when you realize it's over. \n\nI didn't beat Mass Effect...

These really are some of the best RPGs made in the last 20 years; the story, dialogue, and choices are very compelling and really get you involved. Having them all in one place makes it effortless to carry characters to each sequel. Only complaint I have is that the actual combat in ME1 and ME2 have not held up super well; both feel pretty clunky and this is coming from someone with thousands of hours in Arma.\r\n\r\nI managed to scoop this for $6 a few months ago, but even at full price this is worth your money. I'm barely halfway through ME2 and I've already put in 45 hours. Each playthrough will probably run you over 100 hours if you take your time.",

What an amazing game and story. Part one has some outdated game elements, but the story makes up for that big time. I love how choices from part one and two effected part three and even the end game.\n\nDespite EA killing the game on Linux several times with their hideous launcher (which now finally works decently) I had a blast with this. The characters are great, the connections with them are excellent. I wouldn't mind if they made a movie out of it.",

        "review": "I've played it a number of time on PS3 some 15 years ago. This edition is pretty good. ME1 shows its age, LE made it more playable by modern standards. ME1 will remain the 'best' even though it's not because it started the series. ME2 plays pretty much like the original. So not bad, just too many pointless characters. ME3 used to be the 'bad' one but I am changing my mind on it. I've become a huge fan of it. It's the best in the trilogy provided (a) you play as renegade throughout (b) forget this nonsensical accumulation of 'improved' endings. Just stick to the original two from back then (either destroy the reapers or control them) and ignore those super corny 'explanations' at the end with a list of 'dead'.  Jeez, EA, have some faith in the player!!! Best yet, dust off that original DVD if you have it and play it instead. I've done just that. DLCs are rather forgettable for ME3. If you must, play the retake of Omega with Aria. The other three are as boring as Javik himself. Extra praise for the animated quick play through for those who want to play just ME2 or ME3. That was an excellent idea and the result is very well made. Also super good idea for the 'action' mode for ME3. Indeed, ME3 has to be played as renegade and then everything makes sense all of a sudden.  Action mode makes the proper selections (about 66% renegade) without giving the player opportunity to ruin it.",

If you're a fan of epic space adventures, deep storytelling, and characters that will stick with you forever, this is the game for you.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the remastering is top-notch. Everything looks gorgeous—the improved graphics bring the world of Mass Effect to life in a way that makes it feel modern while still preserving that nostalgic charm. The lighting, the textures, the character models—it’s all been upgraded to give you that sweet blend of old and new.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is smooth, especially the improvements to Mass Effect 1. It feels like the combat has been brought into line with the sequels, which makes jumping between games in the trilogy seamless. And oh man, the story... I don’t want to spoil anything for the uninitiated, but the choices you make matter. Your decisions genuinely shape the galaxy, and that’s not something you get often.\r\n\r\nThe characters—Shepard, Garrus, Tali, Liara (I could go on)—are so well-written and voiced that you end up feeling like they’re real people. You’ll laugh with them, cry with them, and get way too attached to some of them. Trust me, the emotional rollercoaster is worth it.\r\n\r\nFor veterans of the series, this is the perfect way to revisit the trilogy. For newcomers, it’s the ideal way to experience one of the best RPG series of all time without the jank of older graphics and mechanics.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re saving the galaxy or romancing an alien, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is everything you could want in a space epic. It’s the ultimate version of a legendary series. Do yourself a favor and play this. You won’t regret it.\r\n\r\n10/10, would punch a Reaper in the face again.",

        "review": "[h2] A Comprehensive Remaster of a Classic Trilogy [/h2]\n\nMass Effect Legendary Edition successfully revitalizes one of the most beloved RPG series, making it accessible to both veterans and newcomers alike. The collection shines in its visual enhancements, improved gameplay mechanics, and comprehensive inclusion of almost all DLCs, offering a polished and cohesive experience. However, it does show its age in certain areas, such as inconsistent visual quality and outdated AI mechanics, and the conclusion of this amazing story may disappoint fans.\n\nIf you can look past all the deal breakers, such as having to download the EA launcher and the complexity that it adds to a simple press and play experience that you expect on steam or it be the ending that ends the story for the trilogy, this is definitely among of the best experiences by BioWare.\n\nI recommend the trilogy for anyone who loves a rich, story-driven RPG filled with unforgettable characters and meaningful choices that shape the journey. Despite some minor imperfections, it beautifully captures the enduring magic of Commander Shepard’s adventure through the galaxy, proving why this series has remained a beloved classic in gaming history.",

One of the best games trilogy of all times, with a rich story spanning 3 full games, some very interesting characters and companions, a morality system (Renegade/Paragon) and the ability to make some real decisions, some of them impacting all 3 games, since you can import saves from ME1 to ME2, then from ME2 to ME3. For all 3 games, I think I put hundreds of hours in my old saves.\n\nBioware used to make good games, see KOTOR 1&2 and Dragon Age Origins&Awakening as well, quite similar to Mass Effect, these games also being quality party based RPGs with great stories.\n\nMy issue with the Legendary Edition is that you are forced to make an EA account and install their trash app. GTFO EA",

Definitely worth and effort to get into the story and memorable characters. I will however never forgive the devs for fucking tech armor in ME3 cause GODDAMN that shit was pure useless in 3 other than making me fat and retarded. Anyways please play these games but either buy the originals or get it on sale if you dont want the hassle of trying to get older games working on newer systems. Ill never live down my first experiences with these 3 games. And dont forget that Tali will always remain the dummy thicciest girl and best girl.

I can totally see why this series is a loved classic and I'm glad I am giving it a shot.\n\nas i never played it growing up, i can only speak to the Legendary Edition from watching comparison videos, and overall this has definitely had a very hefty aesthetic re-tooling~ everything looks great, even with the empty, uncanny faces of the era it hails from lol.\n\nthere's tons of lore stuffed in every corner, with the codex and the writeups for every planet... i didn't really interact with that much, I feel like the game gives you enough to learn and chew on as you go. the story is decent, nothing ground-breaking or super emotional or anything but i was intrigued by some of the cool sci-fi concepts, and the characters are decent.\n\nthe relationships with your squadmates are cute, though they more often than not feel fairly superficial. i would love to learn more about them so looking forward to that in the following games. Tali is by far my fave! & Liara. Garrus and Wrex are cool too, Kaiden is pretty bland, and Ashley is yes, an annoying space racist unfortunately lol.\n\nthe combat is alright, i basically just treated it like a straight-up FPS, i didn't dabble much in the magicky stuff cuz it wasn't very fun to interact with. mostly stuck with the pistols and sniper rifles. the upgrade system is straightforward, overall nothing special about anything here really, but also nothing bothersome either. things can get a bit repetitive, but usually there's enough of a story element to make things interesting.\n\nthe Mako parts are... alright, the boring empty planet traversal isn't the best but if you stick with the main story then the Mako parts are generally alright. The side quests in general are mostly not great, though there are a few that have some more story elements that can be interesting, esp if they are connected with one of your squadmate's stories. Some pretty funny moments though where someones like \"I'ma kill everyone\" and you're like \"Hey don't do that, i believe in you\" and they're like \"oh my bad i'm sorry,\" some v silly writing at these points lol. i did a smattering of side quests, and made sure to do any that have effects that carry forward into Mass Effect 2, but mostly just stuck with the main story.\n\noverall, a fun time! and probably would've blown my mind if i'd played it when it first came out. excited to play the 2nd which many people have informed me is their favourite of the trilogy~",

        "review": "After 500 hours and nearly 100% this game, I can only say: holy shit.\n\nI came into this game knowing nothing about the franchise besides it being a highly revered Sci-fi RPG and my I left my first playthrough completely blown away. The combat isn’t anything jaw-dropping, performance can be iffy in certain sections, but the core story, characters and side-missions are absolutely some of the best I’ve ever seen in a video game.\nLegendary Edition is a collection of three games, remastered and with all DLC included. Each game has a distinct feel, tone, gameplay loop, crew and story:\n\n-\tME1: the starting point of the franchise, the first Mass Effect elegantly introduces the world and has the best main story of the trio, with a charismatic antagonist, interesting missions that are all memorable in their own way and a great ending with a satisfying final decision at the climax. The soundtrack is the best in the series IMO and has some great tunes to jam out to.\n\nOn the flipside, the game massively reuses assets, especially for its side missions which leaves them feeling somewhat “samey”. There is clear reliance on text to convey emotion in a lot of these missions where a cutscene was clearly needed to adequately express the feelings the devs wanted players to experience. Finally, the romance options are quite forced, with dialogue trying to trap you into committing into a relationship in a contrived manner.\n\n-\tME2: The middle entry, the second Mass Effect flips over the table by having work with a minor antagonist from the first game. Mass Effect 2 quickly dispels the first entry’s cautiously optimistic atmosphere with a far grittier and dirtier story that showcases the galaxy’s ugly side. You’ll be fighting mercenaries, criminals and shadowy organizations throughout the Terminus system, essentially the setting’s wild west.\n\nME2 has easily the best cutscenes in the franchise, with masterful cinematography, breathtaking voice acting and jaw-dropping lighting that come together to make the game a veritable feast for the eyes and ears.\n\nWhen it comes to content, ME2 can be described as a polarized game, with it having of the worst missions in the franchise (N7 missions, Arrival, Firewalker) and some of the best as well (Lair of the Shadow broker, Suicide Mission, Loyalty missions). The game also gives you the biggest and best crew, with a vast array of delightful and interesting characters, including some former allies from the first game. The new crew is notable for offering new perspectives on the two mainline arcs that run the long of the franchise, the Krogan Genophage and the Quarian-Geth conflict.\n\n-\tME3: Is the most polarizing game in the franchise, and for good reason. To put in plain, the ending just sucks. In both visual and gameplay aspects it is boring and uninteresting, while the final choice is unsatisfying and just left me with a sense of hollowness.\n\nME3 recurring theme to me is really wasted potential. The optional character you recruit was a dlc character and you can feel it due to his exclusion from the game’s main storyline which limits his potential. The Quarian-Geth conflict is turned into a Black-and-White conflict while completely changing the outlook of one faction, directly going against what we learned in the second game\nThe most bothersome aspect to me however is the game’s treatment of Commander Shepard. ME1 and ME2 walked a delicate balance between acknowledging that Shepard is a character with their own motivations, thoughts and backstory while keeping them as an avatar/vessel for the player to influence the game world. ME3 throws that out of the window by routinely denying the player agency in how Shepard should feel, act, or say. This is painfully exacerbated by the game largely forcing you to only choose between two dialogue options rather than the three of the previous games\nDespite its flaws, ME3 still has some amazing moments and great ideas. The gameplay has been refined and expanded with the addition of tech and biotic combos, complemented by some fantastic  Your squad mates now talk and interact with each other on the ship, making them feel even more alive. The Krogan genophage has an excellent resolution, with either a heartbreaking sacrifice for the greater good or a gut-wrenching betrayal.\nThe third entry also boasts the best lineup of DLC missions in the game. Omega is a return to a location from the second game, with great gameplay, art direction and charming squad mates. Leviathan is a sort of murder mystery turned cryptid hunt with some great moments and an interesting origin story for one of the game’s antagonists.\n\nFinally, the heavy hitter, the Citadel DLC. Serving as a love letter to the franchise and a celebration of its characters, the content focuses on you and your squad mates getting some shore leave as wacky adventures ensue. The DLC is choke full of wonderful moments with your current and former crew, culminating in a party with past and present members of the Normandy that is full of hilarious moments. My only critique really is choosing a more relaxed, fun and laid-back atmosphere clashes with the bleak tone of 3.\nDespite its flaws, pitfalls and jarring decisions at times, Mass Effect has quickly eclipsed any other RPG I played and now stands squarely at the top as my favorite RPG game of all time, and I say this as someone with 800 hours in Baldur’s Gate 3. Its story is captivating, its characters are some of my favorite in all of fiction and its universe is one of the best I’ve seen. \nIt’s a series that neither falls into the pit of hopeless despair nor the delusions of naïve optimism, rather it occupies a delightful gray center, with interesting ideas, thoughtful philosophical questions and fantastic atmosphere that keeps you engaged and wanting more. Having seen nearly all these games have to offer, I can see why this series still has a devoted fanbase and monumental acclaim over a decade later.",

I was unhappy with how some things were done in the first one, and in the second they fixed some of the things in the second, even improved it, then completely dropped the ball on a few others in the third. Getting around in the third one can be a huge pain. The story is really immersive and it's really easy to care about your squad mates, especially if you take the time to talk to them throughout the game. I loved each one in their own way, and if/when they die, it can be truly heartbreaking. Yes, I'm a huge baby when it comes to death in games. \r\nI loved how your choices truly mattered. Even things that I didn't think would have any bearing on the ending of the game, or in future decisions, came back to surprise me. I chose to avoid reading any spoilers and went with what I thought my Shepard would do and it paid off for some really memorable moments. I'm most likely going to replay this game multiple times for different endings, romances, and choices, just to see how much it changes the game because it feels worth it. Even if I have to suffer through some of the poor guidance choices they made in the third one. It had a lot of side missions, but didn't really tell you where you needed to go to complete it. So frustrating. Anyway, great games and so well-written.",

        "review": "review of Mass Effect 1:\n\n6/10\n\nthis game has a lot of contrast. some stuff are great some stuff are terrible, there is nothing that is average in this game. the worldbuilding is super-solid. not saying it's top-notch, it's shaky here and there, races don't feel that deep and very gimmicky etc. but it's super fun to explore and read about. \nstory is good. not super original or engaging or anything but fun. dialogues are great, they are very well written, voice-acting is great as well. dialogue options are pretty good, it's dissapointing in some respects: firstly, they are not that varied, they seem to be but they're not. especially in some sections the main 3 options are actually the same. most of them don't actually change much in the story or the interections you have with the crew. but some of them really effect the story, actually some of their influences span accross 2 and 3. \n\ncombat. this is THE problem of the game. combat is really bad. the 2 companions you bring with you have the intelligence capacity of a house fly. actually scratch that, because even the flies avoid from obstacles, these don't. they constantly bump into walls, get stuck, can't even shoot standing enemies... AI is really bad. \nbasically just firing the gun and shooting something feels... odd. i can't really explain it but it's really terible. gunplay is really boring. that's why i used the sniper 90% of the time. you biotic powers or skill don't make much of a difference either. \ncover mechanic is awful. not much to explain, most of the time shepard can't get into cover properly.\nshortly, combat is very bad.\n\nnow coming to my biggest dissapointment: side quests and exploration. my favorite game is BG1, when i played that game at 15 i was blown away, there was a huge world to explore and i could go anywhere. this is what i look for when we're talking about an RPG. exploration in this game is basically non-existent. there are some barren planets to land on and they're almost completely empty. and you\"re traversing these planets with the four-wheel MACO, which is pretty boring. and this is basically the consensus among ME players. considering it's at least the half of the gameplay it's a big negative for the game. \nside quests are not that good, the levels are boring, stories in these quests are not that interesting either. they can be fun sometimes\n\ncompanions. half of them are good the other half is pretty boring. the best one is of course Garrus, he is a fan favorite. i don't believe there is a person who hates garrus. the VA is great, the character himself is fun and charismatic. Ashley is fine, has a racist angle and stuff. Liara is fine also, her dialogues are fun to read, VA feels a bit robotic. Wrex is boring, classic Klingon. no one likes Kaiden. Tali is good.\nthe most interesting part of the companions is that they have unique dialogues to spesific situations or even better have unique interactions with each other, BG1 enjoyers like me won't be surprised by this but for the average person it's pretty neat. \n\nin conclusion: combat is very bad, exploration is dissapointing, story is good, companions are fine, dialogues aresuper solid, worldbuilding is pretty solid. \nyou'll have a good time and it'll keep you engaged. but if you're a CRPG kind of person you will be dissapointed.\n\n\nreview of Mass Effect 2:\n\n8/10\n\nyou've probably heard that this is the best of the series. not, i don't know about that because i haven't played ME3 right now. \n\nthis is certainly a special experience, again, the RPG elements are not what i expect from BioWare, but overall this is a great game as a linear, story-focused experience. \n\n\n\ngonna write this later",

        "review": "It is not a perfect upgrade of the original series, but the original three games were not perfect either. There are some bugs. So do be aware of those. I accidentally soft locked in all three games at different points, typically towards the end or on the actual last mission. So that required a reload to a previous save (so SAVE OFTEN). BUT what enhancements there are to the games, are certainly worth your time if you love the originals. If you have never played, you are missing one the most incredible trilogies of games ever. HOWEVER, I do not know if I strictly recommend the Legendary Edition AT FULL PRICE. Put it on your wish list and wait for a sale. BUT DO PLAY THESE GAMES. I should go.",

        "review": "~ME1~\nPros:\nGood remaster overall. Performs fine at max settings on my 1440p ultrawide. Minor stuttering in the vehicle at times but wasn't that bad.\nAwesome voice acting with some recognizable actors. The female Shepard was perfect, tough and no-nonsense, which really fits the character.\nMusic was nice too for the theme of the game. Sound effects were pretty good.\nNice storytelling. I enjoyed the dialogue and the intensity of the story presentation as well as the ending.\n\nCons:\nTerrible face sculpting, many characters have a permanent look of surprise. Game is showing its age but even some older games had better character design.\nThere are some idle animations to keep things lively but for the most part, everyone stands around with the same stiff/rigid demeanor.\nNot a great shooter. There is no ammo management as all guns have magical infinite ammo and instead you manage their heat levels.\nAll bodies magically disappear when killed. Presumably because this was a console title.\nAlso related to this being a console game first...this has a horrific UI with little to no information being presented on screen at any one time.\nAwful AI, the melee opponents often run in circles. Enemies with guns will run right up to your crew and stand in the middle of everyone while trying to shoot you point blank. Allies will run in front of you constantly. If you order them to go to a position, sometimes they do it, sometimes they don't, and they never stay there long.\nLevel design is very boring. Just your basic empty hallways, copy/pasted rooms with minimal detail/clutter.\nVehicle controls are abhorrent. Press W to move forward but if you look behind you then W goes backwards? Makes no sense.\nCharacter can't sprint for more than about 2-3 seconds.\nAudio sliders only affect the gameplay so the cutscenes were WAY louder than I wanted.\nLooter shooter where you constantly pick up 100 different weapons to replace that of yours and the crew.\n\nOverall not a bad game but definitely not a great one. On its own, I would still recommend it for the story alone.\n\n~ME2~\nPros:\nMassive improvements overall. Better face sculpting, ammunition in favor of heat mgmt, improved AI, significantly better level design, terrific sound effects and voice acting as well as storytelling. The story is vastly more entertaining the way you go around recruiting your crew. The intricacy of the characters and how each has their own unique side quests really makes the game shine.\nYou can import your save so your character looks the same and all decisions made in the previous game are part of the sequel.\nNo longer a looter shooter as you have specific weapons and instead focus on upgrading them instead of replacing them.\nDepending on paragon/renegade levels, you can interrupt others during dialogue and change the outcome of a scene. This is actually really interesting and fun, I wish more games did this.\nWith more character involvement and backstory, you really see how unique each alien race is in terms of their speech patterns and culture etc.\n\nCons:\nStill terrible at sprinting, awful UI, they replaced the vehicle with a hovercraft thing that you platform with which is arcadey and doesn't belong.\nBodies still disappear and while they did add ammo mgmt, all the small caliber weapons use the same ammo which is fully replenished when picking up ammo.\nThey did away with crouching and using grenades for some reason\n\nOverall an amazing game and one of the better RPGs I've played. Worth it for the story alone but the gameplay is vastly improved too.\n\n~ME3~\nPros:\nThey added grenades back in and this time they are traditional throwables which is nice.\nYou can sprint forever!\nStill has a great story and quality voice acting. I was literally in tears at the end. I truly enjoyed this experience.\n\nCons:\nThe dialogue seems a bit silly and even cringy at times. It is slightly less 'serious' than the first 2 games when doing side quests. Also, WAY TOO MUCH TIME is spent doing 'shore leave' stuff which takes away from the intensity of how serious the situation is in this story.\nCan no longer holster a weapon. When you are in a combat area, you are constantly running around with weapon drawn and stuck in a tightly narrowed FOV.\nThe journal is much worse, there is less info and it rarely tells you where to go or what step you are at within the quest. You could have the item you need to fetch and not even know it. You might know you need to return an item to the Citadel but you'll have zero indication of which floor to go to.\nNo more probing planets for materials or minigames for hacking/bypass - this may be a Pro to some but a Con for others. Instead you probe a planet to acquire an item for a fetch quest and don't even leave the ship. I can understand removing hacking/bypass minigames for doors you NEED to go through, but removing them from things that would just grant you credits is just making it needlessly easy.\n\nOverall not as good as ME2 on the whole but but still an awesome game with a spectacular set of endings. I loved it at the end and was genuinely in tears.\n\nAs a trilogy, I highly recommend it. This is a great series and I'm happy I finally got into it!",

        "review": "\"Mass Effect Legendary Edition\" revitalizes the classic trilogy with enhanced graphics and quality-of-life improvements but can be quite complicated, especially for newcomers. The intricate plotlines, vast universe, and multitude of character interactions can be overwhelming, making it difficult to grasp the full scope of the story and the impact of your choices. While the remastered visuals and streamlined gameplay mechanics are impressive, the depth of the lore and the complexity of relationships can leave players confused. For those unfamiliar with the original games, the learning curve may feel steep, making it challenging to fully appreciate the epic narrative and emotional stakes involving Commander Shepard and their crew. Despite these complexities, many fans still find the experience rewarding—but it's essential to approach the game with patience and an open mind.",

There were some bumps which is expected from a game this old but honestly I would have prefered some of the aspects not to have as much in the sequels, and that I could romance Varrus in ME1 >:C\r\n\r\n[h2] ME2 [/h2]\r\nThe continuation from ME1 story wise is *interesting*, felt a bit comedic at times but mixed appropriatly. Being able to take your character through the games is something I didn't know I valued so much and makes the story feel a lot more impactful, altough I quite liked in the companions in ME1, ME2 just went crazy, having characters from the first game both join your party and add a lot more species variety, which sets up great groundwork for ME3, the side characters also got a lot more development which was both much deserved and needed for the sequel story wise. Setup for the Illusive man was pretty great too, made me want to punch him for two whole games. Suicide mission was the perfect climax also.\r\n\r\n[h2] ME3 [/h2]\r\nStakes as high as they get story wise, made me very happy I didn't lose a squad member in the suicide mission because I really don't know how the hell half of the plotlines would unfold, great characters got amazing ends to their storylines and you get the whole galaxy together.\r\n\r\nThe ending however I didn't quite like, which is fine, I'm more of appreciating the journey than the finale. And what a journey. Amazing 10/10",

        "review": "Got it on sale for 10 dollars. First one best story, 2nd one Had the most charm, 3rd one I havent finished yet but loving it so far. Great trilogy. So far I do think I like the 3rd one the best. All of the them have similar flaws   but for the price its worth playing. Its just as good or better than most games out there. Even with the huge list of flaws, I really enjoyed each main mission and the I love every character. Best part of this game is the choices hands down. I love that every choice carres over and you can hear the result of them in the news. Its great.\n\nUpdate. The first one is amazing and beautiful to look at. The gameplay is great too. My problems are the missions, progression, and the boss fights. Not a perfect game. So far these might be the worst boss fights I every seen. Havent finished the game yet and will update later. Each side mission is so similar, it feels the same. The main missions have cool scripted events but the fights dont change much from the first level. \nPart 2. I beat the game and think it had one of the best endings I seen anywhere. In love with the ending of the game. I still have issues with the first half of Mass Effect. I did start Mass Effect 2 and it looks so much better when it comes to visuals. So far the changes they made makes gameplay awkard as I was used to the old system. Anyways I want to say again love the ending. It was way better than I imagined. \n\nGot it during the sale and had to get the EA app. So far all the graphic upgrades are very noticable. Huge improvement at least visually. \n\nPlaying Mass Effect one.\n I played it before but never got past level 5. Now that it is upgraded, I wanted to see what the first game is about. So far I think its decent. The game throws a lot of information and mechanics at you. All of it I would say is decent or better. I did have to look up controls several times and some quest guides as the hints are terrible. Another reason I wanted to play the first one, I know your decisons carry over to the next game, something I only seen in Mass Effect. I want to call this game great but after 9 hours, nothing seems original. I think what gets me is the sheer amount of options this game has. Im still on the first one. Almost right at the get go, the amount of choices you can make that make big impact is insane. \n\nReally the best part of the game is the conversations. Its basically a big budget visual novel. As a Warhammer 40k fan, Im picking the jerk who works with aliens but will sacrifice them if needed. What sucks is the people all feel one note but the aliens feel natural. Anyways if you read this then yes I do recommend it. It is a long and not a easy game so you do need skill and time and make choices. If you can do all that, then you should play it.\n\nMass Effect 2,\nSecond Update\nBeat the game at 46 and a half hours. Much longer than the first one. Most of that time was in resource collecting and conversations. The game makes many improvements over the first game but I do have many problems with it. That said I really enjoyed the ending and was just blown away how many things affected the ending. Its one of the smartest games I ever played. I do want to mention that the mini games get old quick and the vechile missions might be even worse than the first game. Its not perfect by any means. All the missions rewards are less than you find exploring. Even hacking a hard lock gets you a tiny reward. While I do have many many issues with the game, I do think its much better than most things on the market. I was able to one shot the final boss with the nuke launcher and that felt amazing. One issue I want to mention is most of the classes are light classes and the boss fights are really difficult even when you know the weakness. Some characters you gather end up being near pointless but they are fun to talk too. Another issue is I personally didnt find any of the characters attractive. You have to spend an insane amount of time with that character to unlock their scene which is why Im bringing it up. The romance scenes are also easy to lock if you dont have a guide. I ended my playthrough with about a 50/50 on good evil choices. Some of them are questionable. One good choice ends with a kill. There are other moments that are head scratchers. One other thing I want to mention is the with this edition, the starting weapons and armor are just as good if not better than the final ones you can unlock. I want out of my way to search for better stuff only for it to equal my starting weapon. Now each class makes a certain weapon better, mine was sniper rifles. I chose a sniper playthrough mostly cuz of the large rooms you fight in. I dont think I ever got a one shot with the weapon even fully maxed out. Heavy weapon ammo is so rare you never use it. One thing that did annoy me is time between missions matter and you get punished for messing around. This is a 40 hour plus game. Thats dumb. I have many many more issues with the game but I did buy for 10 dollars and I think it was worth it. It is a amazing game. Both this and the first one. \n\nUpdate\nThis is after 20 more hours. Not perfect but it is way better than Mass Effect 1 in almost every way. The only thing that really bugs me is any millitary choice gives bad karma which is werid and the main enemy has something called barriers and I dont have any counters for it. I have counters for everything except that. It is a much faster story than 1. The levels are a lot shorter, usually about 3 fights, and jam packed with new info. While the levels are shorter, the game has taken much more time to complete. I havent beat it yet. Just exploring now. Im playing the dlc and have mix feelings on them. The acting and new characters are great but the all the new ideas are not that good. Im glad its optional and not part of the main story. Another issue im having is everything seems to be more simple. I get Mass Effect univierse is complicated and theyre a lot to keep track of but the game being so simple is starting to wear me out. Its not feeling new anymore. While I enjoy the action, I kinda wish Mass Effect was just one big visual novel instead. The writing is easily the best thing about the series. \n\n\nSo far its a lot more interesting. I enjoy every change except for maybe the combat. Its a shame the characters in the first game feel more like cameos than actual characters. I wouldnt mind exploring them more. Both games are similar where the main story is short but theyre a crazy amount of side content. I noticed not only did my choices carry over, I did not do every mission in one, My money and even material carried over. In one, material was only good for making money. In this, Material feels more important than stores. I havent explored much or done much side content. I wanted to a little stronger in case its high level missions. I do think the new crew and ship is a lot better and more interesting but it does lose that adventure feel and charm the first one had. Still the changes are so big, Im not sure if I could ever play the first one again. The new weapon types are also a nice touch. Ammo for them is rare. if you dont upgrade all the time, it might not even be possible to win. I think thats one annoying thing about this game. Its got tons and tons of choices, but its clear that you need some of these to even survive. In a long list of choices, some of them feel forced. I only just started playing 2 so I dont know how big the impact of you choices yet. My other issue is armor is so much wose in this game. I dont know why they nerfed in it into the ground. Every enemy does damage to you which is silly as your armor is pretty much diamonds with a diamond force field with diamond skin. But sure bullets hurt you. Even though your basically one big diamond. Now your team mates are mostly just normal guys so them getting one shotted is fine with me.",

The Citadel was a boring start to the first game, which turned a lot of new players away from the franchise early on, the endings were controversial for good reason (though it's not as bad as many have been lead to believe, and has been improved on since the initial controversy), and Kai Leng is annoying and has plot armor a mile thick.\r\n\r\nDespite all of these faults, I still consider the franchise a flawed masterpiece, and something that I would recommend to nearly everyone. Play the entire trilogy, start to finish, and I'll guarantee you won't regret it.\r\n\r\nRuns well, is fun, and is a unique and unforgettable experience.",

And they shall gaze in wonder and amazement at how a masterpiece such as Mass Effect could have been made by humankind. Put simply, this game is an absolute must-play. Everything from the story to the characters; from the worldbuilding to the voice acting (and so much more) is quite frankly some of the best I have seen in any piece of media ever. Friend, this game is worth getting for the characters alone; they are that good, not to mention all the other things this game does so very well. The one and only critique I can think of is that this game requires the use of the EA Launcher, which can be a massive pain sometimes. But that pain is oh-so worth it to have but a fleeting taste of perfection. Therefore, I implore thee: deny yourself not from one of the greatest things to have graced our universe. Play Mass Effect.\n\n\nI should go.\n(This is a joke you'll understand if you play)",

Somehow they managed to make a party thrown by my character interesting, witty and funny.  I couldn't believe it!  This story has plot twists, suspense, and unexpected quest design.

From the remarkable main story, to the soundtrack, to the breathtaking graphics of the Legendary edition, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\r\n\r\nDo you like an elaborate world and story together with excellently complex written characters? This game will awaken true magic in you. Thank you, BioWare for this unforgettable experience.\r\n\r\nI'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite game on the Citadel.",

It isn't just a simple story, it is much more, here you watch a rising of life, that started with exploring universe and ended with saving this one from his demise. Commander Shepard became one of my favorite protagonist, alongside his values and ways of life. My first meeting with this franchise happened in my childhood, and it started with original Mass Effect 2, I got if from my father's disk. I don't remember much, but it left me with a sense that it was an amazing game. And finally I got to play all trilogy and my memories didn't lied to me, because it was one of the best experience I have got from video games, alongside Metro series, Wither 3 and God of War 2018. I strongly recommend this game because it has one of the magnificent story to tell you, an amazing world and story to tell about every person that live in it. Audio, gameplay, graphics, cinematic it all is on the highest level. This game is already in ''My most beloved\" list and I would like to all try it, because it is worth all your time.",

Complete with remastered graphics, easily transferable save data (important for trilogy-wide playthroughs!) and packaged with every single DLC ever produced for the franchise (minus one ME1 DLC that was lost to code hell, but it can be restored via mods). Speaking of mods, the Mass Effect franchise has one of the most solid and easily accessible modding communities on the entire internet. Almost every little nitpick anyone might have about the series can and already has been addressed by the modders. It's an absolute godsend on top of an already excellent and technologically stable title.",

        "review": "OVERALL EXPERIENCE\nAfter completing %100 platinum, i can tell that this was such a wonderfull journey and a very nice decision to merge all games into a single edition with all downloadable content. I did spend around 110 hours to complete all games twice (except the times i played when they first released), seeing the difference between them and how they got improved by Bioware over the course of the franchises lifespan was priceless. Playing them back to back and getting lost in the deep lore and carachters of the franchise makes me think this Legendary Edition might be my favourite game. Connections between games, carachters that not died because of your choice appears in the next game and etc... Perfectly connected saga with the save import system between games so you can continue with the same carachter and consequences of what you did on the previous games. Also having all DLC content included in this package is a huge upside. Some of the DLC’s are the best additional content in gaming .(Leviathan for ME3, ShadowBroker for ME2, Omega for ME3 and many more...) \n\nNOTE: Due to the switch from Origin to EAplay application couple years ago, some achivements and accesibility things doesn’t synch and pop when you do them. And no fix from EA for years...\n\nMASS EFFECT:\nMass effect is the only one in the triology that i did not play when it first came out. Time to time, I’ve heard that this is the superior game in the original triology from people around me. Unfortunately, as much as i love this game, i don’t see the legend when i play it in 2020’s. If i play this seperately today, i will definitely give it a little bit less credit but don't get me wrong, when you play all games back to back with the legendary edition, Mass Effect still shines as a must play. All in all, still a fantastic game and definitely above standarts even today with some bold downsides.\n\n+Fantastic storyline with lots of iconic scenes, such a great way to start a franchise.\n+Carachters, the lore and the events behind all races. Smart connections between all of them.\n-Openworld-ish mako missions and planet exploration is garbage. Gameplay mechanics and carachter mobility kinda sucks for todays standards. \n-Role playing options are fantastic but the dialogues behind them are primitive and weaker then i expected. Needs more carachter based dialogues other than a galaxy that is danger cliche.\n\n8/10\n\nMASS EFFECT 2:\nThe GOAT. The best game in the triology for most people. And i agree. Lore and story after Mass Effect expends and drastically changes in a fantastic way with Mass Effect 2 and still avoids being a cliche soulles RPG story. A fantastic mission chain and side events, all the gameplay and dialogue negatives are cut down from the first ME, and more carachter and personality based narrative... You literally need to connect with people and talk with them to beat the game with the best ending. Shocking details with the dialogues after the first game, i think ME2 is the magnum opus of Bioware.\n\n+Story standing more on the personal relationship side with recruiting people and doing their loyalty missions, talking with them and solving what you need with them is priceless. Still has and uses the huge events galaxywide that happened in the first game, adding more of the persona side definitely makes this game balanced and one of the best action-RPG’s ever made.\n+Gameplay, gunning action and mobility definitely fits todays standards. Such a beautifull jump from ME1 to ME2\n\n10/10\n\nMASS EFFECT 3:\nFor a lot of people, this game is a dissapointment but i definitely dissagree. Ending for this wonderfull triology was not what we expected back in the day. But the quality of the missions, being the latest and the most modern version of the previous games, i think Mass Effect 3 is closer than you think to Mass Effect 2. Storyline is based on ending the huge threat to the galaxy that we were facing previous games, Mass Effect 3 figured out another way to balance between carachters, friendships and galactic history between races and the big finale to the story. Sweetspot between Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. Had a lot of fun with it and absolutely don’t think this is a black sheep.\n\n+Gameplay is fantastic. Everything gets more flashy with this game.\n+2 of the best DLC’s (one of them adds a decent ending over the default ones we don’t like) in the franchise.\n-Not quite a big jump after ME2 that it should be as the big finale. But probably because ME2 and ME3 are in the same console gen unlike the ME and the ME2 difference. \n\n9/10\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAlmost perfectly made remastered masterpiece we have here. Great optimization and price goes down a lot in related steam events. It will be hard to get into because the first ME is a little bit technically old, but once you get lost in the story and push more into the lore, everything will make sense. \n",

        "review": "Mass Effect has been one of my favorite gaming titles for the past decade. So it was a no-brainer for me to download it once I finally stepped into the realm of PC gaming. The Legendary Edition boasts better-polished graphics, but I didn't like that I had to set up an EA account before I could even launch the game. The combat and companion AI in the first Mass Effect game is still a little clunky, even though the steering on the Mako has improved slightly. I noticed a few glitches in the character animations, particularly on their faces; their eyes would either be crossed or roll to the back of their head. I appreciate that they added a bit more choice of hair and skin in the character customization screen, but in my opinion, there could've been somewhat more added. But other than those minor complaints, I still find myself enjoying this game.",

I jumped into Legendary Edition after my girlfriend at the time broke up with me.  It helped me get through a time of being sad, and it felt like I was amongst friends once again.",

NO QUEST MARKERS! Tells you to 'investigate' people, i.e. actually choose to ask extra questions rather than them being just part of the otherwise completely quest only dialog- Lamesauce. Hitting space to skip all the cut scenes is wonky. Graphics turned all the way up, the cut scenes are not pretty, interesting, or able to move the camera. Often things were referred to in the cut scenes that are around the player, and the view would change but... not bother to show what they were talking about. Lazy programming, not hard to have the camera actually shift to SHOW what is being talked about. No indication that my dialog choices mattered other than choosing to 'investigate'. Two npc's were in conflict and I choose with both of them to have the other one give in first, the 2nd dialog did not show up properly and had no effect, I simply could not choose another path despite dialog options.\r\n\r\nThe inventory, buy/compare system is just painful. Stats are hidden in menu, and you can not see the description of your items when you compare. Some things are mentioned in the items description but are NOT on the stats leaving you wondering how much of a penalty something has, perhaps the multiverse will never know...\r\n\r\nCould not get the damn squad members to leave me alone. WTF why would I need them? In Mass Effect Andromeda squad members were useless junk if you can actually play. All they do is force you into combat and act like morons. No tact, telling them to go places is just lame. These games are just not hard either. Jump and shoot while strafing keeping objects between you.\r\n",

        "review": "Mass Effect is hands down one of the best video-games I ever played. It captivated me from the very beginning and made me feel empty inside after it ended. There’s a lot to unpack, so to keep it simple, fun and readable, I will focus on the key pros and cons based on my experience.\n\nPros: \n  • The galaxy is vast and richly detailed. With various planets, alien species, and interstellar politics, you’ll feel like you’ve stepped into a sci-fi novel—except you’re living it, and there are no inconvenient paper cuts from turning pages. Really, the world-building in Mass Effect is so good, it makes the real world seem like a bad fanfic. I spent so many hours reading the index that I started to wonder if I was missing out on a future career as an intergalactic historian.\n\n  • The game’s diverse and well-written cast provides some of the most memorable dialogues and relationships you’ll encounter in gaming. From heartfelt conversations to dramatic confrontations, the character interactions are both engaging and deeply immersive. Just be cautious, as you might realize you’re more emotionally invested in them than in your real-life relationships. Sorry, real friends, but Garrus and Miranda are just cooler. Plus, they don’t judge you for playing video games at 3 a.m.\n\n  • Your choices matter. Like, really matter. Decisions you make can significantly impact the story and the fate of entire species. It’s like being the galaxy’s most powerful influencer, except your posts involve saving or destroying entire civilizations. No pressure though.\n\n  • The combat system blends tactics with action. You can strategically use biotic powers, tech abilities, and firearms to take down foes. Sorry, I have no joke for this one.\n\n  • The soundtrack and voice acting are top-tier, with a score that captures the epic feel of space exploration and voice performances that bring characters to life. I sometimes listen to the Mass Effect soundtrack when studying astronomy, and it makes the subject seem so much cooler than it really is. Seriously, it made me feel like my homework is the first step in saving the galaxy.\n\n  • The Legendary Edition polishes up the visuals like a good Instagram filter—making everything look beautiful, especially in ME3. But let’s not get too crazy here; it’s still an older game, so don’t expect it to look like it’s fresh out of the Unreal Engine 5. It’s more like, “Hey, look, I’m a vintage beauty with a facelift.” Not bad, right?\n\n  • The cost of this game during sales is super cheap considering the amount of top-tier content it provides. Seriously, this game offers so much that it almost feels like stealing.\n\n  • There are bunch of good mods available that can enhance your experience even further. Whether you’re looking to tweak the visuals, adjust gameplay mechanics, or just add some more content, the modding community has you covered.\n\nCons: \n  • The planet exploration in the first game is as exciting as watching paint dry on an alien wall. It’s mostly just empty areas with different textures, like someone gave you a sandbox and forgot to add the sand. But hey, at least the sequels figured it out and ditched that mechanic.\n\n  • The first game of the series can feel a bit dated. Some gameplay mechanics and user interface elements might remind you of a bygone era of gaming. Think of it as classic sci-fi nostalgia with a sprinkle of clunky charm.\n\n  • Some of the side tasks can get repetitive and overly time-consuming if you aim for 100% completion. You might start questioning your life choices as you scan yet another barren planet for resources\n\n\nTo sum it up, Mass Effect is an outstanding RPG shooter, particularly if you love good storytelling, memorable characters, and a richly imagined universe. Just be prepared for some serious post-game withdrawal—it’s the kind of game that will have you staring at the credits, wondering what to do with your life now that the adventure is over. It will make you question if your life will ever be as exciting again. Spoiler alert: probably not. But hey, at least you’ll always have the memories!",

Fair enough and satisfying end of the Trilogy.\n\nBest Side Quests: Mass Effect 2\nBest Ending: Mass Effect 3\nBest Music: Mass Effect 3\nBest Romances: Mass Effect 2\nBest Game in the Trilogy: Mass Effect 2\n\nMinuses:\n\nGameplay. I understand that the first game was released in 2008, but game by game it's not Improved so much. As result in the 3rd chapter I was burned out because I had 3 actions that was assinged on 1 button. When you press run the character jumps or hides, etc. You can get used to it, but in some tight battles it's annoying to much\n\nBoring game elements. For example in the Mass Effect 2 it was resources gringing, in Mass Effect it's frequent jumps to the Citadel just to have a short conversation with NPC. \n\nPluses:\n\nThe Main Plot. Apart of all minuses the story is catchy and it grows more once you decided to explore all side quests. Especially I was touched by Mass Effect 2, when each small side quest deserves your time. \n\nVariativity. I really enjoyed how I could play \"bad boy\" in Mass Effect 2! You could say and do whatewer you want and you cound't predict concequences of your choices. And it was organic and funny. Unfortunatelly, devs cuted that in ME3 and there was less fun to play bad part\n\nCharacters. Most of them are so remembered and after 100+ hours in the Trilogy you feel their different personalities and characters. Unfortunatelly in ME3 devs decided to switch interractions with companions to the Sims mode with appartments meetings. \n\nFinally I would say Mass Effect deserves to be played for each player who likes single deep plot. Just give it a chance and you will see how you will fall into the beauty of the endless space full of life and advantures.\n",

The legendary edition was a great first experience having continuity across the 3 games. This is a game where the clunky game play and dated graphics, are completely overshadowed by the story and characters, highly recommended.",

        "review": "In spite of the weird, questionable design choices they did to the visuals in their attempt to give the games a facelift, this is more or less a definitive version of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe first game is missing the Pinnacle Station DLC (though not Bioware's fault on this) if you care that much, but using the Mako is SLIGHTLY more bearable thanks to the added speed boosters. The Mako is still pretty aggravating. It's some of Bioware's finest work in terms of writing and worldbuilding, so it is very much worth it if you take your time playing it.\r\n\r\nMass Effect 2 is my personal favourite, as that is where the gameplay actually becomes decent (despite the lack of tech and biotic powers). The story may be simple, but the character writing is top notch, and it makes you invested in the fate of each character. It's also the first game where you get to romance Tali the best girl (don't fight me on this, it's not up for debate).\r\n\r\nMass Effect 3 takes the combat of the second, and refines it to such a polish that the combat alone is worth playing, especially since weapon modding makes its return from the first game. Aside from the opportunity to ascend Garrus into godhood with the correct build and weapons, the writing overall is pretty weak. It also has the worst DLC of the three games, so temper your expectations when you play through them.\r\n\r\nIf you want to relive the good and the bad of the trilogy, or if you want to experience it for the first time, this is the best way to do it... Outside of already having the original trilogy and DLC on the XBOX 360 before the 360's Online Marketplace shut down.",

        "review": "I am new to the Mass Effect series, and am glad I came across it. The trilogy has jumped to the top of my favorite games of all time. I started playing the first game and played all the way to the end of 3. The story is very well written, and the voice acting is fantastic. Jennifer Hales stands out for her performance as female Shepard. Mark Meer does a good job with male Shepard but is not as compelling as Hale's performance. The first game was the best of the series overall but all three were very solid. The companion characters are the best in 1 and 2 and most characters reappear in 3. 3 is by far the weakest game but is still very good. I find that as part of a 3 act series that the ending to game 3 works fine as it is. I know a lot of players disliked the ending to 3, but if you look at the games as part 1 - the beginning, part 2 - the middle, and part 3 as the end of Shepard's journey then the ending is a fitting end. The series also gets major kudos from me for including a strong disabled character. Joker is an excellent pilot and very skilled. The other characters don't pity him or make a big deal about it. They simple treat him as a part of the crew and a good soldier. He has several great scenes in the series and it doesn't get much better than when he has to fight off invaders by himself.",

My only real complaint is that in my opinion, the combat system is a tad clunky(in all 3 games), but you can get used to it in a few hours.\n\nThe reason i dont recommend the game is purely out of spite for EA and their inaptitude to fix their shitty launcher which is also forced onto you whether you like it or not, that coincidentally breaks achievements in the game(if you're an achievement-hunter/perfect game hunter, keelah se'lai, comrade)",

Could do with more diverse things to attire myself in... more enemy species, more humanoid species... ...more planets... MOAR GIMMY MOAR!!! lol jks but I would recommend you flourish this unfinished exploration game, as it stand Nomansky has provided more with less time and assets.\n\nThis Review was for Andromeda even though I prefer the story and diversity in the main series(legendaryedition) I think the gameplay was much better in andromeda, the class where a bit too restrictive in LE but the content was lacking in Andromeda... I adore this series and admire how they kept a cool head and clear vision on their project.\n\nI have one small complaint about MassEffect LE, why did you get rid of our grenades and heavy weapons? considering what we are fighting... Those are kinda necessary.",

If you buy this game, or any other EA game for that matter, just be aware that you will have to use their proprietary launcher that requires you to be connected to the internet to play a singleplayer game, and there's like a 50% chance that the launcher will fail to connect to their servers, so you will be unable to play the game you paid for. Steam needs to just start telling these garbage publishers that if they want their game sold on Steam, it must be able to be launched from their launcher alone, end of story. If they can't program a game launcher that actually, you know, launches a game, they have no business forcing me to use it. But of course, if game publishers had to use Steam's launcher, that means they'd have to purchase all the data that's been mined from me from Valve instead of mining it themselves.",

Don't let the time played fool you, I have over 300 hours on each of the three games included in this Edition on Xbox. You will enjoy this game and it will be one you return to over and over.",

        "review": "Mass Effect is Dragon Age for sci-fi fans (not surprising, considering the franchises share a dev). It embodies the same caliber of detailed story and missions, a nice variety in characters with their own personalities, plenty of skills to develop, etc. I feel the interface is done well to promote the sci-fi feel of the games. The major difference that I can draw between the games is the combat system; DA focuses on hand-to-hand combat with detailed tactics and a battle pause feature while ME is primarily a shooter with augmented abilities, and more simplified tactics (you can place your squadmates in certain locations and designate targets). Probably the most interesting thing is how different yet equally functional each game in the trilogy is, just like Dragon Age. It requires some adjustment as you progress, but it prevents you from experiencing \"rinse and repeat\" when it comes to game sequels. I partly hope the rumors of a ME4 installment continuing Shepard's story are true - although, who could you possibly be facing now? - and I wouldn't be surprised considering the impending release of DA4 this year after a decade hiatus. All in all, you shouldn't pass this up, especially if it's on sale.",

        "review": "After hitting their lowest point with the consecutive releases of the abysmal spin-off Mass Effect: Andromeda (2017), which led to putting the series on ice, and the soulless live-service cash grab attempt titled Anthem (2019), the developers at BioWare turned their focus to the next entry in the Dragon Age series. However, the development has faced many challenges, repeatedly pushing the potential release date further into the future. In late 2020, BioWare announced a remastered version of the original Mass Effect trilogy (2007-2012) titled Mass Effect Legendary Edition (2021), and shortly after revealed that the Mass Effect series would continue. Since the next Dragon Age is still in the final stages of development, the next Mass Effect is still undoubtedly many years away. In the meantime, the release of MELE has served as a successful intermission for fans between the main line entries. But the question remains: should you play it? \n\nAt its core, the Mass Effect series is a third-person cover-shooter with light RPG elements, set in a near-future sci-fi version of the Milky Way galaxy. From the ruins of a long-lost civilization found on Mars, humanity uncovers the technology to travel across the galaxy. Humans soon discover they are not alone and eventually ally with the Galactic Council, which consists of several alien races. There is no magic in space; instead, it’s called biotics-the power to harness dark energy and move matter at your will. With that in mind, there are three main ways to deal damage in fights: combat, technology, and biotic skills. The player chooses a class for their character based on one of these three approaches or a combination of two. For example, the Engineer class focuses solely on tech skills, while Vanguard wreaks havoc up close with a blend of combat and biotic abilities. Before and after a battle, there is usually a lot of dialogue, where the player can play the hero with Paragon choices, or be the “cool guys don’t look at explosions” with Renegade dialogue options, all provided by the patented dialogue wheel.\n\nArguably, the first game, Mass Effect, is the weakest in the series. The player takes control of Commander Shepard, an Alliance Marine who becomes the first human Spectre Agent for the Galactic Council, tasked with taking down the rogue Spectre, Saren. On this journey, Shepard is accompanied by a diverse squad of different races, all of whom have a bone to pick with Saren. People on the internet often remind us that the combat is outdated in this game. They are correct. What they fail to realize is that it's the most enjoyable part of the game. The combat remains consistent from start to finish. Pick the Soldier class, equip heavy armor and a shotgun, and the player rarely needs to worry about the cover system, allowing them to focus on running and gunning foes at close range. The story is not as stable. It starts slow but eventually builds up. There are only four main missions between the prologue and epilogue, and the plot only becomes interesting near the end during the fourth mission. The squadmates Shepard gathers are the main reason players don’t quit after the initial hours, but the dialogue is often insufferable. Shepard talks to everyone like how people used to talk to the early smartphone voice assistants: “Tell me about the history of your race”, and NPCs respond as if reading straight from Wikipedia. But the most annoying part of ME is the Uncharted Worlds side missions. The player lands on a small region of a planet with a physics-defying vehicle, the Mako, and must traverse the tallest mountains and steepest valleys to reach their destination, which is an identical warehouse or bunker on every planet. These missions are optional, but they build the world and provide experience points and loot necessary to tackle the sudden difficulty spikes in the main missions. \n\nThe second game, Mass Effect 2, is a significant improvement over its predecessor. The Uncharted Worlds missions are gone and the concept of a few longer main story missions is replaced with many shorter, linear episodes. The dialogue is vastly improved, as Shepard and various NPCs now converse more like real people. The combat is also more streamlined now. The player no longer constantly finds new gear throughout the game but instead acquires a few weapons to stick with. This removes the inventory management almost completely. The lack of armor tiers and the fact that the enemies always hit Shepard if staying in the open, forces the player to stick to cover. The skill tree focuses solely on battle abilities, and the final upgrade of each power offers a choice between two different options. The story picks up from where ME ended, throwing the player straight into the action. This time, the plot unfolds like a heist movie: half of the game is spent on Shepard gathering the best talent across the galaxy for a high-stakes mission, and the other half is spent on Shepard getting to know the hired individuals and gaining their loyalty. When it’s not guaranteed that everyone will return alive from the mission, the team members wish to make amends so they can die in peace if it comes to that. It’s in Shepard’s best interest to be there for their squad. This is the highlight of the trilogy. However, ME2 is not perfect. There is a tedious scanning minigame that the player must do. They scan planets and that way gather minerals. The minerals are used to upgrade the stats of squadmates, equipment, and the ship. The Legendary Edition includes all the DLCs, but only the two new squadmates, Lair of the Shadow Broker, and Arrival are worth the time. The latter two are best completed near the end of the game. \n\nAfter ME2, the final game in the series, Mass Effect 3, starts with a bang. The entire galaxy is under serious threat, and it is up to Shepard and their crew to save the galaxy. Facing nearly impossible odds, Shepard must build alliances across the different races, no matter the cost. Gameplay-wise, the combat builds on the foundation of ME2, but this time it’s polished to a new level. Shepard feels more agile, the cover system is smoother, and there’s a much larger variety of enemies to face on the battlefield. Different weapon types are no longer locked behind the class choices, like in ME2. Instead, there is a weight system in place: the more weapons Shepard carries, the longer the skill cooldowns are. The good things end there. Unfortunately, ME3 was rushed (likely by EA), and it doesn’t live up to the expectations set by its predecessor. For example, there are fewer squadmates in ME3 compared to the amazing cast in ME2. And the worst offense: the original ending was a disaster. Although they tried to do damage control by releasing a few patches and the Leviathan DLC, they couldn’t fix the fundamental problems related to poor writing. The ending is just less bad now. All the DLCs in ME3 are worthwhile additions, but make sure to play the Leviathan and Citadel DLCs near the end, preferably just before the final mission. \n\nEven though the ending leaves a bad taste, the journey is amazing. If the player is patient enough to endure most of ME, they’ll get to fully enjoy ME2, and the ball is dropped only near the end of ME3. It’s a shame that the development team was in such a hurry that they couldn’t deliver a competent conclusion to the saga. The gameplay itself doesn’t win any awards, but it improves with each installment. The game is rich in lore and story, and though the plot starts slow, once it grabs the player, it doesn’t let go until near the end. But the main selling point of the series is the squadmates Shepard meets along the way. It’s no surprise that, to this day, people still comment online about how Garrus Vakarian is their favorite side character in any game. If sci-fi interests you and you are not afraid of playing a seventh-generation cover-shooter, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is worth considering.\n\nKeelah Se'lai",

Every character, dialog/interaction, story, writing and gameplay are unparalleled. I usually do not play shooters but this series singlehandedly brought back my interest into TPS genre. I feel guilty for purchasing on sale. This is the best video game trilogy in my opinion.\nBioware, please do not abandon this franchise and this universe which is so masterfully crafted. Also just a suggestion, you can outsource smaller Dev teams to develop spinoff games such as maybe a metroidvania where you play as Garrus Vakarian before in his early days in C-Sec or maybe an isometric twin stick shooter with Urdnot Wrex during the Rachni wars / Commander Anderson during the First Contact war or maybe even a point and click adventure related to other popular ME universe characters. This definitely will help to know more about their past events and of course the earnings will help to fund your next big project i.e., Mass Effect 4.\nI already bought the comic series as well which gives additional lore about the characters in the ME universe and reading through it is equally enjoyable just as the game. \nGood luck for ME4.",

Considering I got it at 75% off I can't exactly complain about a tenner to upgrade the graphics on ME1, but if I'd paid full price after reading what they'd promised I'd be fuming and probably accusing them of false advertising to the extent it borders on a scam.",

        "review": "Mass Effect Legendary Edition: A Solid Remaster with Room for Improvement\n\nThe Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a commendable effort to revitalize a beloved trilogy. The visual upgrades are noticeable, and the performance improvements are welcome. The inclusion of all DLC is a fantastic bonus, offering additional depth to the already rich narrative.\nThat being said, the trilogy's age does show in certain areas. Combat, especially in the first game, can feel clunky at times. While the Mako has been improved, it still remains a divisive element. Moreover, some of the original game's pacing issues persist.\nMass Effect 2 remains the standout, with its gripping story, memorable characters, and refined gameplay. Mass Effect 3, while improved, still suffers from pacing issues in certain parts, and its ending, though addressed through DLC, continues to be a point of contention for many.\nUltimately, the Legendary Edition is a solid package that offers a great experience for newcomers and a nostalgic trip for veterans. It's a step in the right direction, but it doesn't entirely mask the original games' inherent flaws.\nWhile the remastered trilogy is undoubtedly enjoyable, it's essential to approach it with tempered expectations, understanding that it's a classic series with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",

        "review": "Mass Effect was the second rpg game I played after original borderlands...\n\nit is a good game... with good voice acting, music, gameplay, and rpg elements... choices affect the game but not to a point of a standstill where you're required to start a new game or load a save file all the way back before a choice, which is great because otherwise I would be demanding a refund....  \n\nIn ME1, i like everything... especially how different planets have their own unique look and charm, music, gameplay, voice acting and story are great...\n\nIn ME2 however, everything is good except for the planets and the minigame where you have to look for resources... that gets boring fast... also the planets are just horrible, they all look the same unlike in ME1 where it was actually nice to look at planets... I used to play ME games on soyny, and in ME2, there was a bug where Shepard would face in a completely different direction as you're running around trying to shoot stuff or simply trying to head for cover... well that bug was never fixed and it was ported that way to pc it seems....\n\nThere are loyalty quests in ME2, so once you accept a loyalty mission, complete it right away, because I remember on soyny ps4, if you play around with other stuff, your crew will be not loyal so my advice is take at most 2 loyalty missions and get the characters corresponding with the missions that way you can just go and do the two missions right away.... and to be safe, just do one loyalty mission at a time and dont accept all of them at once....\n\nbut Jesus fkn Christ on a moped... EA is fkn cancer... the game doesnt even start sometimes.  steam you need to get rid of EA.\n\nME3 is good just like ME 2 but regular mobsters are bullet sponges... planets still trash.... and there is a lot going on... most of the time you're trying to figure out where to go because lots of missions don't specify locations... and graphics are slightly worse than in ME2... I also dont like the whole weight mechanic in ME3... if you carry too much weight, your powers take too long to recharge... \n\n\nbut overall, I highly recommend Mass Effect....",

The first game is the best. Great characters and story. You'll get caught up in the galaxy of Mass Effect. From here the story gets worse and the game play gets better, right up until the last hour of the last game is a long segment of slow motion walking and conversations you can't skip through that tries to tie up the why's of a complicated storyline culminating in one of the worst endings in gaming. The ending was so hated that they introduced another possible ending with this Legendary pack. You get all the DLC's as well which are very entertaining and add lots of content. The combat is really fun and the characters are awesome. You'll not be able to help yourself but fall in love with some and hate others. Very good environment for some rpg playthrough conversation and mission choices to match. I played the originals and liked them a lot. Bought the Legendary pack for $8.99. The way they link the games and the dlc's are really great.",

        "review": "I really enjoyed the story and seeing the results of your choices. Especially seeing your choices carry over to the next game. Some of the gameplay mechanics however felt like a step backwards with each game. One example is each weapon in Mass Effect can fire so many times before overheating. Mass Effect 2 now you need coolant clips and heavy weapons ammo. Mass Effect 3 now you need ammo that's specific to each weapon.\r\nAnother example of the gameplay mechanics taking steps backwards is Mass Effect you can carry one weapon of each type. Mass Efect 2 you can carry one of each weapon you can use. Now Mass Effect 3 you have carrying weight.\r\nThe skill system in Mass Effect was also complex, the skill system in Mass Effect 2 was very simplified and the skill system in Mass Effect 3 wasn't as complex as Mass Effect but was more complex than Mass Effect 2.\r\nThings like that kind of make them not feel like they're all in the same series. Still I would say it's worth playing them for the storyline and choices you can make.",

        "review": "Mass Effect 1:\r\nME1 is a great game overall but some of the side content is a bit lacking as the areas can get pretty repetitive with a lot more backtracking than I would normally be okay with. It was really cool to see how Bioware built upon KOTOR as this feels like a slicker version of it aside from the combat. Some of the areas (especially planetary exploration) could've been streamlined quite a bit and a lot of sections were just tedious to traverse in general but I admired the ambition.\r\n\r\nMass Effect 2:\r\nME2 Improves upon ME1 in almost every way, although I felt that some of it was a little too simplified in terms of combat and game play but most changes were welcome. ME2 introduced some of the best characters (mostly Mordin) I've seen in a game and built upon a roster that seemed bare-bones in comparison. The resource gathering was pretty tedious and mind-numbing though.\r\n\r\nMass Effect 3:\r\nME3 is quite dark in comparison to the former games but also has some of the best moments of levity in the series. This entry felt like it was combining the best elements of the previous games in the minute-to-minute game play while continuing to build upon the formula. The combat is pretty easy though as it's not hard to find a something that works really well which trivializes the whole game. Some of the moments you share with your companions were some of the best/funniest/most heart-warming scenes I'd seen in a game and it was really nice to be able to spend more time with them all (especially my boyfriend Garrus) in the Citadel DLC areas. Also f*** you for killing my favourite characters.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best trilogies/series I've ever played. I'm not a huge fan of the paragon/renegade system as it sort of makes you want to restrict your dialogue to one obvious option once you've decided who you want your character to be but I can overlook it given how fun some of the dialogue can be and that not all options are as black and white as they seem (don't be afraid to mix it up now and then, it won't ruin your character). It was not only great to see how all the characters and the world evolved but the games themselves. I went through just about every emotion you could go through with my time playing and I won't forget it any time soon. Play this before you die.",

        "review": "Including all three original Mass Effect games helps keep this one pretty cheap for the entertainment value. Get it on sale of course, it's not like creatives are getting much of a cut when you buy an EA product and they made sure to include the horrible EA launcher.\n\nThe update is not that impressive graphically, but the game is pretty easy on the system and fans so that's fine IMO. The second layer of launcher is annoying, I don't see why it needed to be full-screen and have its own credit video to just be 3 buttons opening the respective games.\n\nThere are some nice quality of life features; the Mako has a \"sprint\" type boost now. ME1's movement and gunplay have been adjusted some to bring them in line with later stuff; still no thermal clips (thankfully), but the running and aiming feel different (on the bright side, headshots are buffed to be in line with later entries in the series).\n\nThe \"uninhabited world\" map design from Mass Effect 1 remains some of the genuinely worst map designs I have ever seen in any game. Even at the time, I can't believe making players drive your weirdly-balanced tank up mountain sides to get to things was considered good design.",

It's still missing Pinnacle Station, which kinda sucks, but overall, it's a big improvement. Mass Effect 2 is still amazing, and I love that they included almost all the DLC. Mass Effect 3 wraps up the trilogy nicely and feels more polished than the original.\n\nIf you're a fan, this is a no-brainer. It's like playing the trilogy all over again, but better.",

I watched him play through a lot of it, but never gave it a go. Years later, generally knowing the story arc of the 1st, I bought ME2 when it released, and played maybe half of it before I put it down and lent it to someone else.\n\nLater on, the 3rd game came out and a lot of people were complaining about the ending. For even longer, I abstained from playing this trilogy.\n\nFinally, 2024, I find the collection on the super cheap (I don't even remember how much it was; it was less than 10 bucks) and power through it all in about 3 weeks.\n\nWhat an excellent and effective story. I was moved by the world and actually felt more and more excitement and tension as every point of the story moved forward. There are many payoffs in the final game that culminated from actions from the first game. I felt all of the stakes as if I was part of that world.\n\nIf it's cheap, it's worth playing through the whole thing, and see what your Shepard will do. It has a very cinematic feel to it, yet still is a game. I think most of my enjoyment came from all of the relationships you form with comrades and people across the galaxy. The game has a way of making me feel like those moments as a child, and I brought all of my action figures together for the \"final stand\". ME 2 and then ME 3 both find ways of replicating that feeling, but in slightly different ways.\n\nCheck it out. There is a reason it is so beloved. I am glad I finally gave it a try.\n\nPS. Yeah the EA app having to run is actually a huge pain. I found one of the smoothest ways to prevent issues with booting the game, is to just start the EA app first and let it load in before you do anything with the Steam launcher.",

        "review": "There's a ton of good, and unfortunately a lot of roughness that still exists in the Legendary edition.\n\nME1: I played this on release way back. Fantastic universe building, characters, music, aesthetics. Mediocre combat and some tedious mechanics. Runs like garbage on modern PCs unfortunately. Thankfully it's only several hours to get through if you've never played before which I recommend you do. Side missions don't add much so you can skip. The magic of this first game is a rare gem.\n\nME2: Swaps the hard sci-fi of the first game for modern Star Wars. New characters are just bad versions of the cast from ME1 who get sidelined. New combat system is not very good and makes no sense in universe. Tedious mechanics from ME1 are now frustrating and still waste time. DLC is garbage, especially the characters. I played through once on release and that was enough. Sadly a lot of small choices here can affect ME3. I'd just use an editor to get the flags you want.\n\nME3: They finally figured out what works and what doesn't for the most part. The lousy new characters of ME2 get sidelined this time, but still are written better than before. The main cast comes back, some more than others. All very strong except for the Prothean who came with a DLC and he sucks- just doesn't fit visually or narratively. He doesn't really add much either. Much longer than the previous games, but you never feel like you're doing the same thing over and over. Decisions actually matter and play a strong part in the story. Narrative is strong except for the few moments of Kai Leng who just ruins every scene he's in as the primary antagonist (so bad a mod exists to patch him out). Combat ranges from okay to pretty good. Tedious mechanics are all gone. The ending is alright. DLC is great and adds a lot for existing characters. Lots of replayability, but unfortunately a lot of flags need to be triggered from ME2.\n\nOverall it's all over the place, but the universe and end result of ME3 is worth the experience.",

I do a playthrough at least once a year, just like with Fallout 3 and 4, because the storylines are so immersive and replayable. When the Legendary Edition was released on Steam in mid-May 2021, I had already prepaid months in advance, excited about the remastered versions of all three titles. While I enjoy ME Andromeda as well, the original trilogy will never get old. The storyline, the characters, the gameplay—they're all timeless!\n\nI recently started a new playthrough and just finished ME1. Even 17 years after its initial release, the experience is incredibly crisp, thanks to the 4K remaster. If you don’t have this in your game library yet, be sure to pick it up during this month’s special promotion!\n\nOne downside, however, is that despite being distributed on Steam, you still need the new EA app to launch the game. It's often buggy, with achievements sometimes failing to unlock or sync. While this isn't a major issue for me since I'm focused on the experience, it's something potential buyers should be aware of.",

The story is engaging and I think it has excellent characters.\nME1's DLC(s) I can't say anything about because I forgot to play them, please read other reviews for more information.\n\nME2 looks a lot better, has more streamlined gameplay and switched to an actual ammo system from just overheating weapons, which I don't really like but there's a ton of ammo lying around and it's not hard to get used to.\nME2's DLCs I feel like have cool stories, it's just the gameplay part of them that feels very bad. The Hammerhead is cool and all but it's made of paper and doesn't have good enough evasive abilities to make up for it.\n\nME3 is good. The characters and graphics are amazing, except for one part. One of the main antagonists of the story has such infuriating plot-armor that it made me genuinely very angry. Also the ending of the trilogy is stupid.\nThe DLCs are very cool. The Citadel DLC made me laugh a lot and has a very fun story.\nIn ME3 I saw some bugs but they were rare.\n\nOverall I recommend it. I would say about a 9/10.",

Playing each game all the way through, really made the differences between them, very evident. I loved ME1, even though it was a bit clunky in many ways......and simple.....but there was beauty in the simplicity. The graphics got better as the games went along, and the controls etc were refined each time. I imported my male Shepard character into each game, so starting ME3 with a leveled character, lots of good gear, and established relationships with the other characters, really made the whole thing magic. At the end of ME3, I thought long and hard about the final decision, and I was perfectly happy with the outcome. This trilogy is a MUST-PLAY.....even in 2024.",

While I usually skip cutscenes in story games, focusing more on the gameplay, I have found myself going out of my way to talk to everyone I can and complete many side quests. This game pulls you in by allowing you to make a personal connection which each of your crewmates that makes it feel as if you are actually a part of the game. The dialogue choices also make your character feel real compared to other games that force you to just sit there while the characters talk and you as a player have no say in the conversations. I haven't even finished the first game in this trilogy, but I am still having a blast. I would highly recommend getting this game as it is 3 games in one and is on sale right now for $9.\n\nTLDR: This is an amazing game that it is only $9 for three games that all progressively get better and carry over story choices you made in the previous game.",

По-настоящему чувствуется ремастер только в первой части, но и в ней разрабы умудрились наломать дров. Имейте ввиду первая часть в Легендарке идет без дополнения \"Станция Вершина\". Вроде бы сейчас это подправили мододелы, но все равно обидно.\r\nСтавлю палец вверх только из уважения к классике.",

There's one that removes his dialogue, thereby improving the game immensely story-wise. \nThe other problem is not with the series, but with the Origin Launcher being mandatory.

        "review": "I'm midway through my second playthough (the second one being modded but the first being vanilla) and all I have to say is... GET THE GAME! IT IS SO WORTH IT! It is my favorite series, as soon as I finished my first playthough I went through gamer sadness where all I could think of was Mass Effect. Allow me to explain the pros and the cons to the trilogy:\n\nPROS:\n-You get all three games for the price of one. It is absolutely worth your money.\n-All of the DLC is free and included in legendary edition. Granted, there are a few DLC I wish I didn't have to play (I'm looking at you, Arrival) but there are some of the best DLC I've played in any game in the Legendary Edition (Citadel DLC my beloved).\n-The story writing of this game is A+ tier. I would put S tier, but there are some things I'm going to talk about in the cons that I just can't forgive.\n-The characters are so well written, even some of the background characters have so much character and interest. You will genuinely feel bad for decisions in this game.\n-Character customization was ahead of it's time. At 2007, I wasn't expecting much character customization (or any at all) but I was very pleasantly surprised!\n-Romances are well earned. It takes time to build a romance, to actually get to know the character and be there for him. Granted, some romances are better (sorry Kaidan, I have to stick with my man Garrus) but there are many to choose from.\n-Throughout the three games, you are deeply invested in the character you make. Paragon or Renegade, even a mix of both, you are actively making decisions that will effect the entire playthrough. Things that happened in ME1 will be important even at the end of ME3. That creates a deep connection to the character you make and how they interact with others.\n\nCONS:\n-You have to go through the EA launcher. I know, it was expected, but the EA launcher frustrates me greatly. It's not the fault of the game whatsoever to have to go through EA, so this isn't so much a con to the game as it is that you have to go through two launchers that have to agree with each other all the time. When it comes to modding, this can be a serious pain.\n-No mod support. This has caused me so many headaches... I spent three days just trying to troubleshoot the mods and get everything to work. Now it works, but it takes about thirty minutes to launch. Due in part to the fact that the cloud storage gets very full very fast. And there is no way to clear that cloud storage (trust me, I've tried).\n-Some of the DLC is awful, and a couple of them you must play. Arrival is by far the most irritating DLC I've ever played. And it's required to set the tone for the beginning of ME3.\n-Being a completionist will hurt you. Trying to finish every mission, get every gun, get every achievement, is going to cost a lot of time and patience. Especially in ME1 & ME2. In ME1 you have the Mako, a tank that can withstand a lot of damage, but is really slow and can't go over terrain really well unless you're gifted at driving Warthogs in Halo (and I still struggled). The Hammerhead is even worse, it's thin as a tissue which makes you blow up and have to restart whatever mission you had, as well as making horrible noises that make you wish you could rip out your ears. Mako missions are more often in ME1 (practically 70% of the game) and luckily Hammerhead missions are sparse (about 5% of the game).\nSPOILERS:\n-The story will kick you while you're down. There are some amazing story beats like the Genophage arc with Mordin and Wrex, and the Rannoch arc with Legion and Tali. The Genophage arc being genuinely one of my favorite and most satisfying arcs (when done correctly). However, some arcs will disappoint you.\n-The literal ending of the game. To save you heartache now, if you want to play vanilla: look up a guide to \"the perfect ending\" or if you don't mind a few mods: look up \"the happy ending mod\" and \"play citadel dlc after the end\" on Nexus. I won't get too much into it because it enraged me so much, but the ending is deeply unsatisfying.\n-Your character is with you all three games... and will die. And be revived for sure once, as we see in ME2, but the ending leaves little hope if you don't get the perfect ending. It is the cause for my deep dissatisfaction with the ending of the game. And you don't even get an epilogue. There is no choice of self sacrifice or not, Shepard doesn't get to retire and have a family, there is simply no genuine closure with a trilogy that was meant to stay a trilogy. I blame EA primarily for creating an unnecessary time crunch onto Bioware, causing this mess of an ending.\n-Some characters and romances are really bad. Specifically, Jacob. I will not forgive you, Jacob. I highly recommend to any femshep that wants to play this game, do not romance him. There are many other great options. Jacob will straight up cheat on your character, as well as throw himself into danger multiple times. I recommend not listening to him at all.\n-Legion deserved better. If you're okay with modding, I highly encourage getting the \"Early Recruitment\" mod for Legion. Legion is genuinely one of the most interesting characters that you don't get to learn a lot about due to the fact that they're locked behind a \"this is the end of the game\" timer. They're also REQUIRED to retrieve (not sell, don't listen to Miranda about selling them) AND commit to the loyalty mission in order to properly complete the Rannoch arc.\n\nI could go on and on about what's amazing about the game, what the game could fix, but what matters is you getting the game and PLAYING IT! It is a unique experience for everyone playing the game themselves. Don't let my big block of CONS turn you away from this amazing series, as most of it was just nitpicky. Do take the mods into consideration however if you want the best experience playing Mass Effect.\nFor now, I'm going to go continue my second playthrough. Please get the game and comment how much you enjoyed it!",

        "review": "Mass Effect 1 is an unpolished gem. The attention to exposition and world-crafting is impeccable. The remaster reworks some gameplay elements but can't resolve the core issues- this is a poorly balanced RPG/Shooter with very lacklustre AI.\n\nMass Effect 2 is better polished. It offers compelling set piece missions and narratives but ends up being more on rails than ME1 and the overall narrative direction takes some questionable turns. Gameplay much improved though and is an excellent experience in its own right.\n\nMass Effect 3 exacerbates the issues in ME2. Narrative direction is out the window, though many of the individual pieces are well crafted. Introduces some truly cringy side characters.\n\nOverall the whole experience is marred with hard crash bugs that have no business being in a remastered game, and that significantly detracts from the experience. This is compounded by being forced to use an EA launcher that straight up refused to run initially and has been offering repeated inexplicable errors since. Mass Effect has ambitions of being a story experience, but the narrative flow that it tries to weave is broken and frustrated by the aforementioned bugs, poor level design (ME1) and cringe (ME3). I wouldn't necessarily say you *shouldn't* play this game, because it has a lot to offer to space opera RPG fans, just that if you do, you should expect to be let down repeatedly.",

        "review": "Simply the greatest sci-rpg narrative gaming journey epic I have played since I first played through it over a decade ago on PC Ubisoft own platform , then again on PS3, then again as Legendary edition on PS5, and now again on Steam. I am only a few hours into this Steam version play through but its all the same in a greatly enhanced way. This legendary edition just makes QoL better, particularly with the much more aged ME1. But the trilogy is a great impact on my life in gaming. Highly recommended. The first game is rich in character exposition, slower paced than the sequels because there are far more RPG elements but I love that. And I love that trilogy mixes some game-play throughout. Just enjoy the journey and don't ever be picky, embrace and enjoy the great entertainment and game-play that was delivered to us by developers who poured blood and sweat into making this.\n\nUpdate: Played through the trilogy twice now. Same high level experience overall but I am suprised that old glithes from the PC originals over a decade ago, still remains such as dialogue fading to silence and some battles getting stuck, requiring a mission reload. The Playstation Legendary edition, didn;t have as many of these ancient glitches but the PC versions did which I thought the Legendary would have fixed by now. \n\nDoesn't affect my overall rating but the occasional dialogue fade is the most frustrating glitches and wish that was fixed.",

        "review": "I have played the Mass Effect series 5 or so times in my life. This was one of my favorite game series to play while growing up. Being able to play the entire series again has been insanely fun and a great use of time in my life. Excusing a couple of DLCs here and there that I wasn't able to play when I was younger, I remember this game like the back of my hand and it has been a treat to revisit.\n\nAll of this to be said; I had never played all of the DLC's in the third game and I didn't know what I was missing.\n\nThe Citadel DLC in Mass Effect 3 has easily become my favorite part of this series by far. I wish I had played it sooner. The insane switch to a more comedic, lighthearted experience in the Mass Effect universe was jarring at first, but I quickly came around to enjoy it so much. It genuinely made me laugh at times, and being able to play with characters that you haven't seen much in this game was really nostalgic in a way. The scene where you fight with everyone was really cool to experience as well. \n\nBut I think my favorite part about this DLC had to be the Party. Being able to mingle with everyone, see how characters that never met interact with each other. My heart felt so full and happy the morning after. After I had talked to everyone with their hangovers, I felt a sense of peace and calm. Something you rarely get in this series. It felt like waking up at a sleepover with your friends, and it was a feeling that genuinely made me say to myself \"Damn, I wish I didn't have to leave this moment.\"\n\nThe next time I play this series again, it will be for that moment. \n\nAmazing series. Everybody should play these games. 10/10 forever.",

I have played all 3 in almost every way you can possibly play them...all the choices, all the romances, all the ending...if you can do it in this game, I have done a playthrough and done it.\nThis new Legendary Edition is fantastic, and a welcome version to my favorite games of all time.  The original Mass Effect got the most love in this LE, for obvious reasons, and it does show and make the game better than that original. \nI recommend this game to most anyone that is looking for a game to play if they never have.  My only regret to all of this is that I can't wipe my memory and play this series blind again, because that first playthrough...\nPlay, experience, and enjoy.",

The writing was absolutely phenomenal. \n\nReminds me of a playable version of Babylon 5, right down to the races, politics, and steadily encroaching theme of a shadowy invasion of an ancient race.\n\nOnly one bad thing. The launcher is absolute garbage, causing the game to hang between gaming sessions. Requires PC players to go into their Task Manager and End Task on a pile of EA processes just to re-enable the game.\n\nVery extensive library of mods on Nexus to even further tailor the game to individual play styles or added content to an already immense trilogy.\n\nCan't say enough good things about the actual trilogy though. For me, ranks right up there with Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and Borderlands for massive game world, lore, story, and exploration.\n\nAn absolute must-have for anyone who enjoys easy to play, story-rich adventure of absolute epic proportions.",

The alien others are poor designs, the story is long and tedious and the final climax of it all was deeply boring and unclimactic. \r\n\r\nAlso, you spend game 1 building up all this money and skill, you learn how the skill upgrade system works.. then in game 2 they've completely changed it and somehow you have no skill anymore. \r\n\r\nSame again when game 3 starts - -totally different systems now in place, so you have to re-learn all the boring annoying things.\r\n\r\nAnd then it just forces the game to end when you feel you haven't done much yet in game 3.. and don't get me started on how hard it is to get it on with the female characters! I can't even get the girls I like in a bloody game, having to settle for the annoying blue one, just like real life. I don't play games to remind me how annoying real life is. \r\n\r\nSo many more complaints but it's pointless as the game is old now.",

I love how they combined all three games into one package as well polishing up the originals. The voice acting is really good and not feeling restricted or forced. Mordin is my favorite.",

        "review": "Having just finished this trilogy for the second time, I figured now would be as good a time as any to leave a review.\n\nIt's a beautiful story that keeps raising the stakes in each new game.  Your choices matter.  Whether that be a small conversation with a friend early in the first game or deciding the fate of multiple entire races in the third game.  The relationships you build with squad members almost all feel true to life.  You feel genuinely bad when you upset a squad member, it feels guilty to hold their lives in yours hands, and you feel pangs of  sadness when crew members you've sent hundreds of hours with beg for more time with you near the end of the third game.\n\nThe entire galaxy feels fleshed out and alive.  The history of settlements, planets, clusters, individuals, and races are all interesting.  It feels \"lived in\" in the same way Blade Runner and the original Star Wars movies do.  \n\nExpect lots of okay combat (in the first game) and really good combat (in the second and third games.)  Some exploration in the first game, a slightly stripped back mission structure in the second game, and the perfection of that hub-based mission structure in the third game.  \n\nI don't really know what else to say.  I miss my friends I've spent the last ~250 hours with (across two playthroughs.) I miss Tali as she evolved from a kid on her Pilgrimage to a team leader to an Admiral and a lover.  I miss Garrus as he evolved from a cop who played loose with the rules to a mercenary to a leader of the Turians.  Liara was always there as my closest ally.  Anderson as a father figure.  Wrex as an absolute homie.  Even Ashley as she gradually got over her reasonable distrust of aliens and grew up.\n\nIt's easy to Google \"Games like Mass Effect\" to try and find something that will legitimately make you FEEL something the way these games do, but Mass Effect really is one of a kind.",

I am sure that all the players who came before me experienced a profound impact on their lives after they played this game. \r\n\r\nI wish more and more new players play this magnificent game. A game filled with love and tense moments that would wreck you right until the end. This is the longest game I have ever played and every second of this game made me feel like I am living in another world. The depth of all the characters makes you feel that they are your family. You care for every one of them. \r\n\r\nThis is now my favorite game and will probably be right at the end. Thank you to all the people behind this. It is now time to watch the hundreds of hours of Mass Effect Content in yt, all the hidden eggs and the what could have beens.",

I rarely finish a game from start to finish, usually games get boring somewhere and I never play them again.  This game was different and I completed all 3 games. You really have to play all 3 games in order to get the whole feel of the story. They did a really good job on the story and your friends/allies/companions that you build along the way and at times die.  Not to give anything away, but it really puts you in the feel like it would be facing this situation. Not going to lie, it did give me some depression after finishing all 3 games.  There are some funny happy times in the story and some dark tragic times. I recommend not reading any guides or helps and figure out the game based on your choices at the moment.",

While playing I have no problems because the game itself was developed by competent people, it's the goddamn client that makes the experience unbearable and I can't recommend it because of this.\r\n\r\n If this was purely on Steam it would be a good rating of maybe an 8-9/10 but the client makes the experience far too frustrating to recommend.",

        "review": "I really would like to give this series a fair shot but it seems the PC version is pretty shit. I'm not gonna refund the game as I'd like to give the series another shot in the future and I only bought it for like 5 dollars but I can't recommend it with the issues I had.\n\nFor some context I only tried ME1, maybe 2 and 3 fixed some of these issues but I doubt it.\n\nThe controls for are straight up awful. I'm using the default controls and the game is giving me tutorials for buttons that aren't even mapped in the default control configuration lol. I tried switching the controls in the settings to stuff that I liked which worked for a bit but then my interact key stopped working until I unbound it and then bound it again. This happened multiple times. Eventually it just stopped working all together. I looked up online and it seems this is an issue for some people but I couldn't find a fix that worked for me.\n\nI also suffered from some performance issues in my short time playing. Loading times were fast and transition from gameplay to cutscenes and vise versa worked well at least in the first mission. It was freezing and stuttering that I was suffering from mainly. For context I have an 3070 + 13700kf, I'm not on a potato by any means.",

I haven't had a game leave me as a big emotional wreck like this one has. I hate and love the endings you can get, but leaving everything you've fought for gives a very bitter sweet feeling that leaves you thinking of this game after you've had your first run...thinking of you Garrus <3\n\n\nKudos to the developers, and I hope there is more to come that can follow this story.",

        "review": "Mass Effect 1:\nThe story is so simple because it was a build up for their next game, they explained the Reapers(the main enemies in the game) really well. The strongest feature in this game that even the other two games lack is the RPG mechanic. leveling up in ME1 feels so rewarding and don't forget how the equipment works, i prefer how equipment works in ME1 because it feels familiar to RPG compared to their next games which is basically gave you a stat boost, the only bad thing about this feature is lack of design and you can wear a set of the armor and cannot change every part of it. \nOverall i gave it a 9.3/10\n\n\nMass Effect 2:\nThe combat is much better in ME2, even better than ME1 Legendary. Sadly, it lacks of RPGs mechanic and they changed how the armor works. The good thing about the armor system in this game is you can modify a specific part of it(but not all of them). Don't expect all the QoL feature from ME1 Legendary got back into this game, but you will get used to it.  the best part of this game is the side quest and the story, i think they handle the loyalty mission really well because you can learn their backstory and solving their problem, and i love the main story in this game the pacing can be a little too slow because how long the map is but it is not as slow as ME1 imo. and don't forget how memorable the final mission without spoiling you, the game gave you a burden how hard to leading your team, one mistakes your team can get killed easily. \nOverall i gave ME2 a 10/10\n\n\nMass Effect 3:\nMost of my issue with ME2 was fixed in ME3 gameplay wise, the combat feels fast pace, your companion AI more useful, and much more. They also add more teammate interaction, it's minor changes but significant because your teammate feels more alive and not just standing there. i also love the main story although it felt shorter if you only count the main story alone. But the reason why i beat ME3 so long is because the DLCs, they are longer than ME2 and better imo. My favorite one was Citadel DLC because how much laugh and happiness i had, plus they also add the side activity in this DLC. Honestly the ending is not that bad like some people said, i know it is not really satisfying but i already play games that has worse ending than this.\nOverall i gave this game 10/10",

Think of Buzz Lightyear, remove all the potential restraints that were applied for children, make armor and ballistics AND their effects on that world more Gears of War-ish with less chainsaws. THEN add monsters, pirates, slavers, terrorists, morally inept mad scientific geniouses experimenting on hoomans, corruption in the space council etc. \r\n\r\nGAME DESCRIPTION! Its not No Mans sky, so more like Starfield in terms of where to go or where you CAN go. No open space exploration. BUT its more like there's enough pre-destined locations to keep you entertained. THIRD PERSON SHOOTER, and for some reason you can carry all of the guns. as they are collapsable and attach to your back like GEARS OF WAR. Story and acting is a lil slower, but in terms of Story, think Star Trek. There are dark themes but nothing present. Like you wont find someone actively being tortured, you'll find the bloody chair and a corpse nearby kind of thing. Or someone telling you a story about 'what happened' Though you will get a few choices in game that determine the outcome of the sequels but not their endings.",

A lot of the lighting is much more washed out and soulless, but you can correct it with mods like MELLO that preserve the original artstyle while still giving you the enhanced textures and gameplay.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nGameplay in ME1 is enhanced, lots more mods than the original versions, and puts all of the DLC in the base game so you don't have to go faffing about on EA's websites. \nPinnacle Station from ME1 isn't in the game which is lame. \nBut that's honestly forgiveable since after playing it in the OG version on my last playthru I can 100% confirm it's just a glorified arena.\n\nBiggest flaw by far is the inferior lighting which makes the game look plasticy and soulless, but if you're willing to install some mods and the ME3Tweaks manager, you can rectify these errors.\n\n\nOverall; wait for it to go on sale, and play with mods.",

I figure if you're buying this so many years after it came out, you already know.\r\n\r\nThe good: Legendary Edition has a bunch of DLC and some bug fixes compared to the old versions. Graphics for ME 1 are better than I expected so far, and I have a cruddy workstation GPU. Haven't got to ME1 and ME2 yet.\r\n\r\nThe bad: the game is hard to launch. What happens is 1. Steam installs an app called \"EA,\" aka the \"EA Launcher?\" Not sure. Then 2. EA Launcher runs a \"wrapper\" program that lets you pick which of the three ME games you want to play, then 3. the selected version plays.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I CAN ONLY LAUNCH MASS EFFECT IF I KILL ALL EA PROCESSES FIRST. Not too bad so I won't gripe much about it. But after you play the game and close, some of the EA processes remain running, and for whatever reason that prevents ME from running again. You just get a busy icon briefly and then that's it. No error message or anything. Just doesn't work. But if you kill every process starting with \"EA\" and try again it works immediately.\r\n\r\nI know some other people have given up and requested refunds over this so I figured I'd share my troubleshooting tip. Hope it helps.",

        "review": "The Mass Effect trilogy is a wonderful set of games and the Legendary Edition is the perfect package in which to play them. Each of the games is a solid third-person shooter, but where the game really shines is in its story.\r\n\r\nAs you play through each of the games, you can see how the developers refined the game to do away with tedious gameplay and increase the focus on the story. I think the third game drew some criticism for being less open than the previous games, but I don't think it's an issue.\r\n\r\nOne thing I will say that may not be clear to first-time players - this trilogy is designed to be played in order, in the same way you would watch a trilogy of movies. The character you create in the first game can then by imported into the second, and then again from the second to the third.\r\n\r\nI cannot recommend this game enough. It's a truly cinematic and endearing experience that on completing will leave you feeling sad that it has ended.",

        "review": "Mass Effect is arguably one of the greatest RPG series out there, and I don't believe we'll ever get to see an other trilogy like this one, which is a real shame, since it's probably the single best one out there. Even though the gameplay may feel a little clunky at times (especially in ME1, it starts getting better in ME2 though) the games manage to build a universe and a cast of characters which will stick with you for a long, long time. The bonds you build with them and the individual stories are unforgettable, even though there are some issues here and there. Over the entire trilogy you get to make lots of choices, some small, some literally deciding the fate of an entire race, and getting to shape your personal role in this story is one hell of an experience.\n\nAll three games are great and I'd highly recommend them, but if I had to rank them I'd go with ME1<ME2<ME3. This isn't supposed to mean that ME1 is bad by any means, quite the opposite actually! IT's probably got the best main villain in the entire trilogy and offers some amazing world building, does a great job at introducing all of the characters and offers an atmosphere which the other two Mass Effects don't quite have. The outstanding issue is the clunky gameplay to me though - the mission design and gunplay is fine, it's old, but not too bad overall, but the exploration of uncharted worlds (which offer a great atmosphere) and the side missions linked to them can start to become a pain at some point. I personally had a really hard time exploring some of those planets because navigating in the Maco was just hella painful at times, but the dialogue and choices I got to made during the main story compensated that.\n\nMass Effect 2 was a big step up, both gameplay and graphic wise: The models and textures look a lot better, the gunplay starts to feel a lot more like the shooters from the 2010 era, and the addition of lots of all new squadmates and the constant dread of everything possibly going wrong are amazing. Side quests have also been vastly improved, now being actual missions instead of driving around in the clunky Mako over and over again.\n\nNow, to my favorite, ME3: As much as it has suffered from not getting enough time and having a rather shitty ending it's still my favorite. A lot (sadly not all, there are some plotholes here and there) storylines are coming to an end, you get to make some of the biggest choices of the entire series and ultimately finally get to face the terror of the villains which were built up throughout the entire trilogy. It truly has that feeling of everything is going to end right here and now, and I can't recall anything ever shattering my heart as often as ME3 did. On a side note, it also includes the Citadel DLC, which is probably my all time favorite DLC - it's short, but it offers so many great moments with your squad, I can't even count them!\n\nOverall, Mass Effect is one of the greatest RPGs out there - if you haven't played it yet, I envy you, so go ahead and pick it up on sale, you're not gonna regret it.",

        "review": "Mass Effect is one of my all-time favourite games, and this collection offers the best way to play it by a landslide.\nThe gameplay is rebalanced perfectly, with combat feeling smooth and fun, controls feeling more refined, and AI redone to fit with the environments and cover options, as opposed to the vanilla version where everyone rushes towards you, not just the Krogans and Geth Juggernauts. Not only that, but the boss fights are fun, and the Mako has never felt better to drive.\nBut the main reason this game is so timeless is the storyline, or more specifically, the CHOICE SYSTEM. With the exception of Alpha Protocol, I can't name any other game where choice matters this much: Every side quest and story mission has you making a major choice, each one with benefits and drawbacks, and rather than slamming you as the villain for choosing a more brutal tactic, you're instead considered an anti-hero; or \"Renegade\". \nI personally feel that no matter which class you pick between Soldier, Engineer, Vanguard, Biotic, etc., the best way to play is to balance out between both peaceful and brutal choices, as some of the choices you have to make in this game offer some genuine moral dilemmas and you have to think about the consequences each one entails. So it's for the best to consider both possibilities and the implications thereof.\nCombine this with a rich universe, fantastic cast of characters, and a nigh-uncanny balance of a dark, mature storyline with thought-provoking themes and a sense of wonder, discovery and cautious optimism, and you have a Role Playing Game that shines brighter than any other from the seventh generation of gaming.\n\nOh, and you also get Mass Effect 2 & 3. Those games are also really fantastic. \nBasically, if you haven't played Mass Effect and its sequels, THIS is the way to do so.",

Yes this game is still fun to play \r\n",

        "review": "== SHORT ==\n\n- I really liked it!\n- It took me 120 hours to finish the 3 games on Insanity difficulty and get all the achievements.\n- Overall, the gameplay is fluid and has very few bugs.\n- The story and soundtrack are exceptional!\n\n== LONG ==\n\nIt's an epic trilogy, with a very well written story and charismatic NPCs. The Mass Effect trilogy greatly values ​​the power of choices, during all games you will have to make choices that could decide the fate of NPCs, as well as the availability of future quests.\n\nThe remastering was very well done and the integration of the 3 games into a single package improved the experience of importing saves and playing the 3 games as if they were a single product. Some individual observations:\n\n- ME1: The vehicle gameplay is a bit clunky and the physics are a bit crazy, so if you want to explore all the planets and do all the quests, you might get bored, but it's tolerable. Furthermore, weapon management is also a bit tedious, you will have to manage all weapons (and their upgrades) for all squadmates.\n\n- ME2: The gameplay is very good, everything works as expected and the combat is very satisfying. The weapons management system has been improved (simplified) compared to ME1, as well as the mechanics of exploring planets and obtaining resources. The squadmates' individual missions are the icing on the cake, allowing you to create greater bonds with NPCs and learn more about their background. In short, ME2 is a masterpiece.\n\n- ME3: After finishing ME2, you may find ME3 a little opaque and lifeless, this is normal. Everything will seem a little darker and more hopeless, several aspects contribute to this: the color palette, the number of crew members on the Normandy and the progression of the story towards its apocalyptic ending. However, this contrast in relation to ME2 is not the only \"defect\" of ME3, the gameplay has some balancing problems: I played ME1 and ME2 on the highest difficulty and always using the Soldier class, in ME3 it was only possible to play using Adept class (full biotic) making power combos with squadmates, otherwise it was almost impossible to last more than 5 seconds against enemies - I noticed this very early in my Soldier run, forcing me to delete my Soldier save from ME3 and start a new save as Adept (after researching this balancing problem on the internet). This cost me a few wasted hours of gameplay, moreover, I would have liked to have finished the 3 games as Paragon Soldier on Insanity difficulty, but it wasn't possible, life goes on.\n\nAnd finally, here are some tips:\n\n- Choose before you start ME1 whether you will opt for a Paragon (good guy) or Renegade (bad guy) attitude. When you choose, be consistent and maintain this behavior in the 3 games, your story will be much more concise and you will have access to exclusive dialogues.\n\n- If you are trying to play on Insanity difficulty, remember that in ME3 it is very difficult to be efficient with any class other than the Adept.\n\n- Keep an eye on the side quests, there are several super interesting minor characters and quests that start in ME1 and ME2 and have relevant developments that are only resolved in the last game.",

At time of writing, Audemus's Happy Ending Mod and the Citadel Epilogue Mod give you an actually satisfying ending to a beautiful story. I highly recommend using both of them on every playthrough, even your first. You aren't missing anything from the vanilla ending.",

For me Mass Effect 2 wants you to explore the systems and planets compared to Mass Effect 1 and 3.\n\nMass Effect 3 combat system is better then the previous games. But for me, there was something with the story what felt cheesy, like a typical 90's Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie, big talk and big action. but the story is good but for me it felt the previous Mass Effect games story was little bit better. \n\nBut all and all i'm glad i got the legendary edition and enjoyed it from beginning to end.",

        "review": "The Mass Effect series is my all-time favourite game saga. That being said, the EA launcher causes a lot of issues with booting up the game, and my game dropped around 50 times across the 3 games. With it happening around 30+ times in ME2, it made my return to this franchise a frustrating one. For these reasons, I can't recommend this to anyone. The updated graphics are nice, but I also noticed many glitches and wrong colours popping up. It's been 3 years since the Legendary Edition was released, these bugs and crashes are inexcusable. The games themselves stand the test of time in my opinion, but this ensemble does not represent them well. If I play through it again in another 10 years, I'll be dusting off my old Xbox.",

        "review": "I've never played the original editions but I honestly really enjoy this collection very much.\nThe narrative and the story are fantastic. The lore is complex and well thought out. I love the characters and some choices I have to make in the plot are very difficult, because all options are not simply black and white and risk sometimes even the life of your squad members. \nI have only a few things to critisize about the story. My own main character lacks a bit of personality even if I chose the precostumized John or Jane Shepard, but that's not a big issue when you play around a fantasic squad. The other problem is the dialogue wheel, because the options are always an unpercise summed up version of what the character says, sometimes even so missunderstandable that my character says completely differents things than I want him to.\nWhat I like especially about this edition is the relation between the games. When you start the game you land in a menu where you can chose between the 3 games independetly, but you can import your character and all your choices to the following game when you finished the one before. Even if you are more interested in Mass Effect 2 and 3 I would suggest you to start with the first game because it's a very good introduction in the world and the story and no video game series like Mass Effect feels more like a true trilogy like Mass Effect where all games match together.\nThe gameplay is very enjoyable but still feels like an 15 year old game series with some little bugs. Especiallly in Mass Effect 1 the movement is clunky and the enemy AI is a little bit dumb. But once you're in the mechanics that's also not an big probkem, because you enjoy fantastic dialogues, some cool riddles and still have fun to shoot some aliens.\nThe biggest issue about this game is that you need the EA App and an EA Account to launch even if you have the game normally on Steam and even though it's an offline single-player game. The EA app is honestly horrible and has many errors. Therefore I often have problems to even start this game and have to restart my computer. But once you're in the game you shouldn't have any stability, so I didn't had yet any.\nThe world bulding is fantastic but I wouldn't suggest you to fly to every planet because some of them lack a bit of content and not all of the side quests there are so interesting as in games like The Witcher 3, but you can easily avoid all of them and focus simply on the main story without big problems.\nAll in all, Mass Effect Legendary is a fantastic game collection that every fan of role-playing games and epic sci-fi sagas like Star Wars and Dune should check out. For fans who already played the original gamess it's probably not as worthy because it doesn't feel like much about the games had changed, but I personally never played the original ones, as said before, and on some other internet platforms it's relatively cheap for 3 games together.",

        "review": "Mixed feelings on the remaster; it didn't spruce up the visuals much despite the massive storage increase over the OG games (more than double the original trilogy combined), and the EA 3rd party BS is entirely unnecessary. The games aren't all in the same executable either, instead it's a launcher that boots the game you select. But the save importing to sequels is completely seamless, you can finally get ME3 on Steam, and the best space RPG is available in one convenient package.\n\nReviewing the games themselves is a bit of a waste. They're still the record-breaking, award-winning RPGs of yore. They still fill me with wanderlust and the normal kind of lust when interacting with the many romantically available aliens. ME3 was the first game that made me cry actual tears, that made me actually grieve a fictional character, and the story hasn't gone anywhere.\n\nIf you're new, I beg you to play the whole trilogy back to back to back, but realistically, ME1 only holds up in terms of raw storytelling chops. ME2 took a lot of inspiration from the then-popular Gears of War and the cover-shooting is objectively much stronger; there're several reasons it's widely regarded as the best of the trilogy. ME3 remains my favorite, but only because it builds on all your effort, your relationships and accomplishments of the two games prior.\n\nPlease please please please play Mass Effect. Andromeda was a letdown, but the franchise doesn't deserve to get the EA double barrel to the back of the skull for that. It's a magnificent world with genuinely mindbending levels of flavor text and worldbuilding for you to sink your teeth into. It's an easy to follow, easy to get lost in, easy to love story of one hero standing in defiance of the end of the world despite impossible odds. Moral decisions, gray areas, duty conflicting with emotions... Many games have taken inspiration since, but none have surpassed.",

Even thought you can see the game is starting to show its age however the writing, character personality and the relationship dynamics still holds up, especially the relationship between Shepard and his/her crew. Bought this game for only 65000 IDR ($4) from summer sale. From the value alone its easy 10/10 even without mentioning the price its still 10/10.",

        "review": "I have not played the Mass Effect trilogy in a decade and I am most definitely having fun blasting through it again on Insanity. \n\nIF YOU ARE DEBATING TO BUY THIS GAME JUST FOR THE DLCS - DO NOT!!\nI have never before played the DLCs and am actually surprised at how terrible they are. \nEvery single mission with infinitely spawning enemies and unbalanced for harder difficulties was proven to be DLC. They are waaaaaaay worse than the base content. If it was not discounted so steeply in the steam summer sale, I would have regretted the purchase. \n\nI can't speak for the quality of the additional content for the third part yet, but both DLCs for ME1 were boring and the content for ME2 was aggressively bad, the worst missions in the entirety of the game, and I finished every single assignment. Zaeed and Kasumi both are flat and have the worst thought out loyalty missions, firewalker is boring, arc projector does not work half the time you shoot it from cover, Arrival takes away your agency in a disgusting way. Now that I am reviewing the list of DLCs, I have to agree that Lair of the Shadow Broker and Overlord are actually enjoyable, but that is a small minority.\n\nThe main selling point of this edition, however, is the fact that it does not use the EA's launcher, cause fuck EA and FUCK SECONDARY LAUNCHERS. \nAt the moment of writing this, I am on the last mission in Mass effect 2 and will shortly be moving to ME3 with the same character. I may update this review at a later time, I am planning to fully complete the trilogy and maybe the downloadable content for ME3 will surprise me positively.",

There is not even a slight feeling that the world has a life of its own. These are just objects that are placed in places and perform primitive animations. The shooting is also terrible. The player's task is to point the sights at least approximately in the direction of the enemy and press the left mouse button.\r\nThere is no training as such. I was not explained what the blue and purple bars mean, what they affect and how to interact with them. They didn't tell me that each character has some unique (or not?) skills. I still don't know what to do with them and why they are needed, although I have listened to and re-read all the information provided by the game.\r\nIn conclusion, this is a 2007 game with slightly improved graphics. It is very difficult and not interesting to play now. You might like it if you remember it from the old days. But I categorically do not recommend it to new players, even despite the cult status of this trilogy",

        "review": "True classics. ME1 is very reminiscent of KOTOR in its presentation and general feel. I found the Mako and planetside side missions to be arduous grinds; the payoff for a lot of the side missions was minimal in the first game (i.e., one or two conversations). However some quests (like UNC: Rogue VI) have payoffs in later games that really do reward you for taking a single character through all three games. Generally these games do a very good job with cross-game tie-ins and callbacks to decisions to you made previously that do make the games feel connected. Overall I found ME1 by itself to be fairly dated and I think first time players would have a rough time with it. The paragon -- renegade system was interesting at the time but reads as quite binary given the development of the rpg genre in the years since.\r\n\r\nME2 stands up much better today. The overarching plot is weaker, but the strength of ME2 is in its cast of colorful characters. The most enjoyable content in ME2 were the side conversations and loyalty missions, where you could learn about your companions and help them to grow as characters. The planet-scanning grind was very annoying. The final mission was enjoyable, even if the \"big bad\" was not particularly memorable. The combat was streamlined in ME2 in a way I found more enjoyable, while being slower than ME3, which I think made combat too fast. The combat experience in ME2 was overall my favorite, and I think ME2 was my favorite of the three games.\r\n\r\nME3 comes off as much more plot-driven than ME2. The companion roster is smaller, which by itself wouldn't necessarily be an issue, but several are recurring characters. While there is enjoyable character growth with some of the new characters, several reappearing companions do not appreciably grow over the course of the game, such that their appearance feels a bit like fan service in the sense that the developers may have been scared of fan disapproval if they altered the characters too much. The obvious example of this for me was Garrus, who I enjoyed from ME2 -- he has a few moments of growth in ME3 where he discusses how he feels about his people looking to him for leadership, but other than these few moments he reads fairly flat for the rest of the game. For a game that is shifting to a greater focus on plot than its predecessors, it falters in that focus. The overarching goal of uniting the galaxy to combat the reaper threat is understandable, but it is marred by fetch quests to scan Reaper-controlled systems for random widgets. It feels bad to alter the entire future of the krogan race, only to spend the next half hour collecting doodads for fetch quests with no gameplay. There is also relatively little payoff for these side quests, other than reaching the magic \"strength number\" needed to get the \"good ending.\" The combat in ME3 was too fast for me personally, with many encounters taking only a few minutes. Perhaps that could be rectified by playing on a harder difficulty. The presentation of ME3 is pretty good, but the narrative and characters falter relative to ME2. I would say they are still good relative to the RPG genre as a whole, but ME3 was not the conclusion to the trilogy that I was hoping for. \r\n\r\nHowever, the ME trilogy stands as one of the defining RPG franchices of the early 2000s for a reason. Aspects of these games, like the party dynamics and the paragon -- renegade system, had profound effects on the RPG genre as a whole, and the success of ME showed the industry that sci-fi was a commercially-viable genre, a fact most fans are grateful for. My final verdict is that these games ask you put up with a lot of downtime and grind, with gameplay that is not exactly stellar by today's standards, but in return they offer some truly memorable moments and characters that I think, in the end, are worth the trouble.",

        "review": "Mass Effect (the series) is a classic Action RPG that has influenced the entire medium of videogame storytelling. From its choice-based dialogue trees to its deep leveling, exploration, & combat systems, the Mass Effect series paved the way for blockbuster games like Baldur's Gate 3. Bioware games have a heavy emphasis on companions, & look no further (especially Mass Effect 2) than this series to find friends, foes, & romance among those who would help you save the galaxy. Be a Paragon of virtue or a self-serving Renegade. Pick the collection up on one of the frequent sales & rise to be the saviour or fall to be the villain of an entire galaxy of living, breathing beings.",

        "review": "It always starts with the same question: is it really that good?\n\nI mean, perhaps my tastes were simpler back then, less critical, more lowbrow. I rack up my brain trying to remember details of my playthroughs, but come up empty -- I remember liking it, sure, but cannot pinpoint exactly why, and the scattered screenshots in my hard-drive aren't of much help. So I boot it up again, and a hundred hours later, I end up with the same response I always do: yes, it's that good.\n\nI have played the Mass Effect trilogy three times in my life, and if life allows me, I'll do it a few more times before I die.\n\nHere's a secret nobody tells you, and one that I always forget: Mass Effect is, at its core, a character-based story. The characters are not particularly deep or complex, true, but each is interesting in their own way, and seeing them interact with each other and the world is the beating heart of this franchise. Everything ends and begins with the characters: we care about the worldbuilding because we see the world through their eyes; we think before making our choices because we know that they will react; we care about the mission because we want to see them survive; we keep playing because they are fun to be around.\n\nIt is also why I don't like Mass Effect 2 that much: too few interactions between characters. Its modular structure provides the player with some vague notion of agency, sure, but it ends up creating a narrative structure that's too hard to script for: how can you make the character react to the last mission if it can be any mission in the game? Or, conversely, how can you make two characters interact if you don't know at which point they are in their loyalty quest lines? No wonder that they simply gave up trying to do these things; in ME2, everyone stays in their own room of the ship, completely oblivious to each other and the world around them. For them, only Shepard exists, and nothing else. This would be a reasonable decision if modular shooting missions is what people love in ME -- but it's not. People like the characters, the banter. \"Do I recruit Tali or Garrus first?\" is an empty choice that no one cares about, one that ends up having no consequence whatsoever, apart from its existence making it too hard for them to talk to each other.\n\nThankfully, in ME3 they fixed it all. The storyline is more linear, sure, but that's a small price to pay for hearing what everybody has to say about the last mission. Your crew members react. Talk to each other. Move around the ship. The Normandy feels alive in ME3, in a way that had not been seen since the between-mission meetings à la Star Trek of ME1, where you could hear Wrex talking shit about Liara before she mind-fuck-massaged you in front of everyone. Those were the best moments in ME1, and it's incredible to see them resurface here in ME3.\n\nThe crowning jewel is, of course, the Citadel DLC: a mission that can best be described as \"what if Mass Effect was a sitcom?\". This DLC is, in essence, a big get-together party with the ship's current and previous crew, containing hundreds of lines of interaction between characters that, up until now, had only a dozen lines speaking to each other. In that sense, playing the DLC is like diving into the chocolate river at Wonka's Factory: a delicious thing that you rarely experienced, but now a thousand-fold, almost too much to contain. It makes you want to drown, to be there forever, hearing what Zaeed and Wrex have to say to each other, seeing how Tali gets when she drinks. They're your friends, and they're here.\n\nThe designers got it. In the end, they got it -- they realized what it was all about, and doubled down on it. It's beautiful.\n\nI have now played the Mass Effect trilogy four times in my life, and if life allows me, I'll do it a few more times before I die. The shooting kind of sucks, some missions are boring, and Shepard is a Mary Sue -- yes to all above. But no game has ever come close to being such a nice friendsfest, and in that regard, ME continues to reign supreme.",

That is the issue, it doesn't run. It crashes or claims the game is outdated. It makes it unplayable, this adds no benefit  to the consumer who already purchased the game, it is single player so does not need any additional software. It is about a company meeting app KPIs while not investing in their tech. An embarrassment that will ensure I do not purchase EA products again. This was my mistake for purchasing from them.",

        "review": "My Dad played this when the games were first coming out many years ago, he told great stories of how epic the trilogy was. I was a mere young boy and didn't understand the messages behind these stories. Many years would past and I would forget these tails of trials and tribulations. However on a random Saturday night I would find the legendary edition on sale. 80% off, what a steal. I remember hearing the stories, how this is one of, if not, the greatest trilogy of games ever created. That led me into an experience like no other. Many people play games and enjoy them. They enjoy the rush, the thrill, the story, the ups and downs. This game is not something you enjoy, it is something you experience. I went into this game with the knowledge that their was someone named Commander Shepard and there was big robots and alien sex maybe. How naive I was. The feeling you get whilst playing this trilogy is unexplainable. Every action matters. Your character will stay with you from start to end. Your experiences are their experiences and their experiences are your experiences. By the time you reach the ending of the 2nd game, you have peaked in your gaming career. Then the hash realities of what we call 'life' showcased in a grand display of symbolism the world has never seen. An unforgetable experience. The sound design was created by divine beings who are unlike anything we have ever seen or heard. I am truly saddened that I only get that true 'wow' factor playing this game once. Yes this game has great replayablitiy, but nothing with compare to your first playthrough. I have ascended by playing this game.\n\nOverall 11/10, I cannot wait for the true 4th game when Mass Effect returns (Sorry Andromeda was ass).",

I'm going to start another the minute I finish my current one. This trilogy is so rich with lore, incredibly well-written with beautifully crafted characters, an amazing soundtrack, and fantastic gameplay. It starts off as a slow-burn, but I seriously recommend going through with every side quest, every little optional thing, and just full-send it like that through the entire series to get the most out of your play through. I also cannot recommend enough playing as FemShep. Her voice acting is golden and enriches the experience exponentially. (Not to say BroShep's voice acting is horrible! I just love FemShep's dynamic voice.)\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, I realize that EA's launcher is horrible, but if you manage to butt past it, the games themselves have little to no issues. I've only experienced two bugs and crashed once in my 172 hours of playing, and they weren't completely game-breaking (a note: manually save frequently in the first Mass Effect. Autosave doesn't occur as often as it does in the following games.)",

This is one of my favorite game story lines of all time.\r\n\r\nI am not a fan of how the gameplay dynamic changes from game to game, however that was also the case in the original versions. Some of the changes were improvements and others made the game worse. Overall, it’s a wash between the two.\r\n\r\nThat said, the game port itself is absolutely awful, it is full of nonstop game ending bugs that where NOT present in the original versions of the game.\r\n\r\nIn ME1 the voice to video sync is off by as much 2 full seconds in cut scenes. At best it is noticeably off by around half a second.\r\n\r\nIn ME2 the game CONSTANTLY glitches. The sound sometimes stops playing any voice dialog, sometimes all the sound effects disappear, sometimes the music is gone. The only way to correct it is to quit and re launch the game. Unfortunately, you cannot just keep playing and ignore the sound issue because as soon as you cross any load zone after a sound glitch as happened the game will crash. Luckily this only seems to happen on the Normandy so the game remains playable.\r\n\r\nME3 same sound Sync issues as the first game. At least it doesn’t crash constantly.\r\n\r\nEven with all the super annoying bugs I still recommend playing the game, but if you have the option to play the originals instead of this buggy port, do it.\r\n",

But i can not on good concience recomend buying this while it requieres the crime against humanity that is the EA game launcher to run. \r\n\r\nFirst of all you can not run this SINGLEPLAYER game offline because it requieres that your EA account be conected to the internet. That would not be a big problem IF THE GAME WOULD ACTUALY RUN. I have not been able to start the game for three days now because when i click on the game all i see is the prepearing game loading window and after that nothing happens. I am tired of looking for solutions. I will not bother deleting and reinstalling a 110 GB game. All this bulshit because EA (a multi billion dollar company) cannot make a launcher that fucking works without bugs.  Oh and speaking of bugs they have not fixed any from the original trilogy so excpect the game to crash and doo all kinds of wierd stuff all the time\r\n\r\nFuck EA they ruin everything they tuch. Do not give them money untill they do better.",

        "review": "A few of my friend recomended me this game  , but everyone has different taste i guess. One mans trash is another mans treasure. About the game - Story was lets say abit above everage , i guess  people liked this game just because of it. It doesnt have anything else much to offer. Graphics where ok gameplay was wery outdated same button that picks up items runs  covers and jumps = failure  you allways do what you do not  want to . For example  runing from the enemy just to be  set into cover  and  facing backwards to your opponent and instantly dying . Difficulty setting insanity is true  because on  one mission  its supper easy and the second one you get killed in seconds. Ammo was allways not enaught opponents are bullet sponges. There  are basicly no navigation  to where are you suppose to go you have no idea what are you doing  is it a DLC? is it a main quest ? Maybe a side quest ? Is it missable ? You have to google  every mission and spoil your self to  know that your on the right track and not missing on  on something. Another horrible thing is EA app you must use too, and its hella buggy. Made me miss out on some achievements  but i found a workaround just set it to offline mode. So it took me 108 hours to get a perfect game , but its far from  perfect. I do not recomend this game because of  these things ive said.",

        "review": "Mass Effect Legendary Edition: A Rekindled Love Affair (Mostly)\n\nLet me just say upfront: I adore the Mass Effect trilogy. Replaying it with the Legendary Edition was like catching up with old friends. The graphical upgrades, especially in the first game, are a significant improvement. Seeing the Citadel in its remastered glory? Breathtaking. The streamlined game play tweaks are welcome, too, particularly the Mako's improved handling (though it's still a bit…special).\n\nThe narrative, especially in Mass Effect 2, is a masterclass in character-driven storytelling. The suicide mission? Still an emotional roller coaster. And Mass Effect 3, despite its controversial ending (which, let's be honest, has been softened with the extended cut), still delivers a powerful punch. The sense of scale, the weight of your choices, the sheer epicness of the galactic conflict…it's captivating.\n\nAnd then there's Tali. My Tali. From her shy, inquisitive introduction in the first game to her fierce loyalty and unwavering support throughout the trilogy, she's easily one of the best-written characters in gaming history. Her romance arc? Chef's kiss. I'm a sucker for a good love story, and Shepard's relationship with Tali is one for the ages. Seriously, BioWare, give me a Tali spin-off already!\n\nNow, it's not all perfect. Some of the original jankiness remains, particularly in the first game's combat. And while the visual upgrades are generally fantastic, some textures and character models still show their age. But these are minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things.\n\nOverall, the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a must-have for fans of the series and a fantastic entry point for newcomers. It's a reminder of why these games are considered classics, and it reignited my love for this incredible universe. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start another play through. For Tali, of course. ;)\n\nExtra notes:\n\nOkay, look, I've poured over 100 hours into this trilogy, seen everything, done everything, romanced everyone (for research purposes, obviously), and I'm here to declare, definitively, once and for all: Tali'Zorah vas Normandy is the best. End of discussion.\n\nI know, I know. Liara T'Soni has her legions of fans. The blue alien archaeologist, with her powerful biotics and evolving personality? She's a great character, no doubt. And yeah, she's probably Shepard's best match. Key word: Shepard's. Not mine.\n\nMy Shepard's heart belongs to Tali. Her quirky engineering genius, her unwavering loyalty, her adorable awkwardness, the way her voice cracks when she's nervous...it's all just perfect. Plus, that whole forbidden love aspect? The cultural differences they overcome? The vulnerability she shows beneath her mask? Come on! It's romance gold.\n\nSo, while Liara might be the \"canon\" best romance, the one BioWare pushes the hardest, Tali is the one that truly resonates with me. She's the one I think about long after the credits roll. She's the one I'd build a fleet of starships for. She's my best. And after 100% completing this legendary saga, I'm even more convinced of that fact.",

        "review": "This review for the Mass Effect series is long overdue, to say the least. The games are so beloved that I'm not even sure that my Positive endorsement matters at this point. Here it goes anywho...\n\nMass Effect is a story-rich, action-packed, RPG that takes you on a wild ride as the main protagonist, Commander Shepard. The trilogy reminds me of being engrossed in a good science fiction book series, but is even better because you get to make key decisions in your Shepard's journey. I like Mass Effect for the same reason that I like Star Trek: The Next Generation- The dynamic that exists between a diverse crew and a captain that knows the crew members as individuals, utilizes each of their strengths, and unites the crew for a common cause. The crew members in Mass Effect have uniquely different flaws, strengths, beliefs, skills, and backgrounds. I enjoyed getting to know each character, and loved watching my crew/friends work together to accomplish amazing feats. The interactions between the characters, as well as the character growth, are also believable. Shepard and the crew members all grow and change as individuals over the course of the series, in the same way that positive influences and trauma shape actual people. \n\nI am currently on another play through of the trilogy, in an effort to earn most of my remaining achievements while enjoying the story once more. This leads me to the one and only complaint that I have in regard to Mass Effect: My Shepard will not have a random love affair in ME2 and I will therefore never have all three Paramour achievements. This means that I will be missing one achievement for the entire trilogy. My Shepard's romantic partner is unavailable during ME2 because he is away on a mission, and he is also emotionally and morally conflicted over Shepard's reappearance and Shepard's alliance with questionable entities. His feelings, although very frustrating, are understandable. (My Shepard put herself in his boots for a moment, decided to give him time, polished her heart on her sleeve, and then saved the whole fancy universe some more.) I believe that all three Paramour achievements should be granted to players that remained loyal to stubborn and driven romantic partners that were only available in ME1 and ME3, so that those players have the opportunity to reach a \"Perfect Game\" achievement-wise. There is something commendable about a Shepard that knows exactly what they want and who sternly, but politely, declines easy hanky-panky. ...I guess my game will have to be Imperfectly Perfect or Perfectly Imperfect.\n\nWell this review took a strange turn- hanky-panky and whatnot. But, see how strangely invested in this game you, too, can be? I was a normal person before I played this trilogy. Seriously, get the games. The collection is fantastic.",

I didn't get these bugs on the original version so its very buggy. I have not tried ME2 or ME3 yet but if the same I will give up reinstall the old version.",

Originals had less graphics but didn't have the edits to \"artistic integrity\" that they spouted so much in 2012 when their horrible ending was rejected.  Now \"artistic integrity\" is changing other writers and designers art because they own it.\n\nMakes the 2012 fiasco complete, total hypocrisy from this company.\n\nI bought this for 5 dollars on the recent Steam sale.  To get it to be playable I spent 1 hour modding Mass Effect which I just finished, spent another 1.5 hours modding Mass Effect 2 and will likely have same or more time to mod Mass Effect 3 to edit out all their \"artistic integrity\" and return it to its original form but with updated graphics supporting modern technologies.\n\nSo, if its 5 bucks its worth it, otherwise save yourself the effort and play the originals which after 5 minutes you won't be paying attention to the slightly dated graphics in ME.  ME2 and ME3 didn't really need any graphical update but I guess they did it with all their \"artistic integrity\" edits to someone elses story.\n\nSlight spoilers...\nME still has the best ambiance of any game and my favorite mission in any game is still Virmire, the first time you speak to Sovereign.  Up until that point on your first playthrough you have hints something bigger is going on but that moment is so shocking and well done its the most memorable game moment ever, imo.\n\nIf only they kept the original writers through the trilogy and didn't go full Action cover shooter (gears of war clone) with ME2 then it would truly be above greatness.  For now its only a great game with such a perfect soundtrack/score that any moment you are completely altered in mood by sound alone.  Then the world building in 1 is great.  ME2 only has character building, like 20 character recruitment missions and 3 main missions.  ME3 is kinda meh, some decent stuff if you consider all the DLC but you can tell how much they didn't put into the Single Player to make the boring Multi-Player addition, which at release you had to engage in to get the \"true\" ending which was just a different color explosion and every elites dream, immortality by combining technology and biology.",

It is still the same great games and the minor changes that have been made are for the better. The flaws of the original games are still there and most of the problems people will have are probably going to be with ME:1. (It is the first, and it plays like it).   But in the grand scheme of things the flaws of the games are minor. The largest thing I personally had an issue with is the pre-rendered cut scenes are in their original resolution (I believe 720p). Makes sense since a remaster is just that, a remaster, not a remake. 90% of the cut scenes in the game are in engine however so it will be rare to notice this. Just an observation on my side, and depending on what resolution you play in this might not even be noticeable or a problem. I cannot recommend this game enough.  If you have never played the Mass Effect Trilogy  you are doing yourself a disservice. Get it, play it, love it, you wont regret it. 10/10.",

I don't think a piece of media has ever made me really feel like a fictional character could be so believably real and makes me want to genuinely get to know and become friends with them (My man Garus the best friend a guy could have)\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor, play these games. They regularly go on sale for ridiculously cheap. Don't look up anything about them, go in blind because you will genuinely experience an absolute Bioware banger, well, when they used to make bangers :(\r\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the modding scene for these games, the've done so much to breath new life into them (I'm looking at you Audemus ending mod) its's absolutely crazy.\r\n\r\nJust play them. What are you waiting for?",

MAKE SURE you do!  Don't just pick Soldier!!!  It is much more enjoyable to use a engineer or Vanguard that CAN use biotic powers. If you pick the basic Shepherd, or Shepard female, you will ONLY be able to use regular weapons and NO biotic-powers.  You can also get your a55 kicked because you can not have biotic defenses as a soldier!  \n\nMAN!!!  You get all 3 games for $7, all the add-ons for all 3 games, and all 3 are updated and fixed for win 10, WOW!  I saw somebody complain about it uses EAs software start-up and you need to be connected to the internet, well I am having ZERO problems with install, start-up, or game play!  ZERO!  The games are playing perfectly!  I had all 3 games on CD and I bet you money I would have issues getting them to install and not glitch because they are 10 years old.  NOW, ZERO problems!  To you guys that b!tch about the EA software, Quit your b!tchin'!  This is the best deal EVER!  I am overjoyed!\n\nReview of games:  I have played all of these through, and this game series is one of the best stories ever created for any games.  Rivaled only by Halo, Half life, and a few others.  They could keep going and I would keep buying!  And, at 7 bucks for all 3 is more than I could ever hope for!  Do not miss this deal!!!",

So far I'm currently still playing through ME1 (close to the end though, at least that's what it feels like), so a review for 2 and 3 will appear later. \r\n\r\nME1: Verdict: Pretty darn entertaining space opera. Sometimes you can tell the game is running on an old engine, the side-quests can become repetitive (land on planet -> enter building -> shoot things -> activate something -> done) and some of the game mechanics are, although still fun, somewhat old-fashioned. But this entire game is about the characters and roleplaying, and Bioware nailed that. The voice-acting is (mostly) pristine, and both the characters and story are well written. The cutscenes play out as action sequences, and I only discovered about 15 hours into the game that dialogue is skippable (by accident), as it is THAT entertaining to listen to, even with the irrelevant side-content. I can also now see how a lot of other rpg's out there have taken inspiration from this game in terms of dialogue and possible choices to make. I can see how this game was the absolute bomb back in the day, given well the rpg-elements are implemented, which is very impressive for a game from 2007. Solid game, would have payed the original price as well for it. \r\nFor ME1: 7.5/10\r\n\r\nI did read in other reviews that choices made in ME1 carry over to ME2 and ME3, so I'm really looking forward to that. Sounds quite interesting and I'm not sure how many games have done that before ME did that.",

This has been one of the few games that has allowed me to remain engaged and entertained regardless of already finishing most of the trilogy, multiple times. The design in characters, level and overall graphics is something most games today struggle to achieve, even with its age. The reviews are right with EA's launcher being trash, but this can be resolved in most cases with restarting your PC, or, running the launcher in administrator mode. Either has worked for me but not sure how it can pan out for the unlucky few. Don't let EA's launcher problem turn you away from experiencing this game.\n\n \n",

        "review": "Play the games in chronological order, you'll thank me later. The world building is immaculate and progresses really smoothly along the trilogy. The gameplay choices carry over from games 1,2 and 3 really well. Unfortunately the ending of game 3 is somewhat of a disappointment and quite frankly ignores all your choices, but 95% of the gameplay is still affected by your choices in and between the games. Companions who die are remembered, events you caused are noted and commented, and you have some unique carry-over choices based on what you did in an earlier game. Especially the major choices of MSE2 influence your options in MSE3 greatly. \nNow, to the actual review.\nIMO: MSE1 has the most genre-fitting gunplay and my preferred inventory and item system and the most RPG-elements by far (combat is quite similar to Halo 1 and 2), but is otherwise quite clunky (in a homely sort of way). MSE2 has the best companions and 50% of the best side-content, and my favorite lvl-up/progression-system. MSE3 has mostly cool action and the best visuals, good quality of life improvements compared to the two earlier games and the most casual lvl-up-system, the least RPG elements, 30% of the best side content (two longer side-quest lines in particular), fewer impactful choices discounting killing/saving some followers (basically choose which lives and dies). My biggest problem with MSE3 is that the combat feels really restricted by the newly implemented weight-system (only in MSE3), and the variety of biotic/tech powers available to the player during a single playthrough is really underwhelming. Otherwise the combat and movement is the smoothest of the three games by far, it's just a shame that using cool guns effectively makes you unable to use you powers (the more your equipment weighs, the longer your cooldowns are). Also, almost all your armor either gives power bonuses, or weapon bonuses. A balanced build is hard to make work, unlike in MSE1 where lvl-ups and the weapons themselves had most of the stats.\n\nTLDR: MSE1 best gear system and most genre-fitting gunplay and the most RPG-elements of the three games, but the worst quality of life gameplay-wise and feels its age as clunkiness.\nMSE2 most of the best side-content, most rewarding exploration, best companions and mediocre combat (not the best or worst). Also the median quality of life and over all RPG-ness of the trilogy.\nMSE3 has the smoothest combat, movement and quality of life, but also an annoyingly limiting weight system and only bare-boned RPG elements. MSE3 might be THE casual RPG of the 2010s. Also MSE3 has the worst PC keybinding options of the trilogy and a pretty disappointing ending that kinda undercuts all of your choices during the whole trilogy. Still probably the best game trilogy I've ever played.\n\nThe fact that I played the whole trilogy in 5 days (89h of gameplay in 120h) and pulled two all-nighters doing so, might tell you something about the merits of this masterpiece of worldbuilding and action-packed casual RPG greatness.",

A off chance that weather knocks out your internet or a stupid rare chance EA shuts down well good luck cause EA in all their wisdom decided you need to be online to launch the launcher cause they did not implement a offline mode for the launcher so essentially the launcher and its games becomes bloatware. now im not advocating for piracy but if company's give people reasons to pirate there will be pirated games\n\nUPDATE\nEA's launcher does in fact have a \"offline\" mode but there's 2 catches the 1st is you have to be online first to then activate a offline mode 2nd if you lose power or shut down your pc it logs you out and turns that offline option back off so you are now stuck again unable to play any EA games until you regain internet. this was brought to the attention of EA support 2 years ago but i guess fell on deaf ear",

Wherever you go you are reminded of your choices and how it impacted the world. And once you reach the end of this experience the only thing that mattered is if you have collected every single collectible there is. It turns out in the end it doesn't matter what choices you made. You are to choose from 4 endings which are in no way impacted by ANYTHING leading up to that point. You can unlock certain endings based on how much war effort you have collected, regardless of your choices. Truly disappointing.",

        "review": "In order to recommend Mass Effect, perhaps one of the greatest science fiction video game trilogies in existence, I must first give some context. I played these games as they released beginning in 2008 shortly after the release of ME1. Up until the end of ME3, me and everyone else at the time were captivated, utterly mesmerized by these games. Rightfully so. However, it was the ending of this franchise that put everyone off. You know what I speak of. The colors, the...star child thingy. Space magic. \r\n\r\nQuickly taking to the internet, it was a year that myself and many others begged developers to change the ending, tweak it, allow our Shepard to be victorious AND live to tell about their adventures. It never happened. Artistic integrity, they claimed, among many other things. We wrote hundreds of letters and even sent their studio trays of cupcakes, all vanilla flavored with red, blue and green frosting. We put up a good fight but ultimately nothing came of it save for a short freeze frame video montage at the end. An \"epilogue\". \r\n\r\nI had sold my copies a decade ago, believing the story of Shepard to never be retold or experienced ever again. Then, early this year, I saw this Legendary Edition on sale shortly after stumbling on the Nexus Mod page for the game. People had created mods for the game, important mods too. Integral mods that would bring this franchise back into the light of day and glory. Everything from the Audemus Happy Ending Mod that removes the star child from the game and allows your Shepard to be the hero you spent three whole games creating defeat the reapers and WIN, to the mod that restores the camera shot of Miranda's butt. It's all there and they are wonderful. \r\n\r\nThere's no better time to play these titles now that moders have given their blood sweat and tears making them right, epic and how they were dreampt to be by players everywhere before that swift kick between the legs at the end of ME3. Now you can play them properly and finish the fight with honor.",

        "review": "SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nThis is one of the best games ive ever played in the 2 or 3 years ive been here on steam. the story is awesome( except for how it ends on mass effect 3), the characters are written brilliantly and get you to love them if they're meant to(except for both Jacob and Morinth), and the romances are great as well(Except for Jacob and morinth again as well as the me 1 romances, although it aint the devs fault for me 1 romances). gameplays also great. now while nearly most everything about the mass effect trilogy is awesome, there are of course the cons. one problem i had with mass effect 1 is the Mako you have to use. that thing is a big pain and incredibly annoying. other than that, mass effect 1 is great. for mass effect 2, it was nearly perfect, incredibly perfect, but there are a few problems. Both Jacob and Morinth. Jacob feels like there wasnt much effort put into his character or anything like that, but rather a last minute addition. something that contradicts his character is that he supposedly hates thane for being a hired killer, but jacob himself is literally a hired gun, so some obvious hypocrisy right there, which may or may not have been intended, probably not tho. something else they could have done with Jacob considering his disdain for assassins was have him get in a fight with thane like tali and legion did along with Miranda and Jack, but they didnt't and missed out on a good opportunity to further implement his dislike for assassins. His romance is incredibly boring and hes cringey during it and even worse, if you romanced him in ME 2, he straight up cheats on you with another woman in ME 3 and gets her pregnant. He literally badmouths Garrus and Thane i think if you romance Garrus or thane over Jacob. he doesn't even do anything remotely useful in Mass Effect 3 and literally kicks back and just watches us do all the hard work in fighting the reapers. the only reason i bothered doing his loyalty mission and kept him alive was because i really don't like any of the characters dying if i had a chance to save them, even if i'm not that invested with them and i wanted the Achievement for keeping everyone alive. One of the worst characters in mass effect. For Morinth, she's basically the same as Samara and there's no point in even choosing her over samara. you may think \"maybe i could romance her instead since samara doesn't want to do a romance.\" While you are right, its literally a huge waste of time trying to get with her. if you choose to romance her and let her mind meld with you, she straight up fries your brain and you die and get a game over screen too. It further just proves the point that she's more of a detriment than actually being useful in the game. in mass effect 3, she disappears after ME 2 only to return as a banshee, being not only utterly useless once again, but also detrimental. just let Samara kill her unless you're trying to go the renegade route, now for mass effect 3. the game was pretty good, but there were some huge flaws with it, the most obvious being the damn endings you get. I kid you not, literally all of the endings in mass effect 3 sick. no matter what, your character cant survive save for the supposed canon ending of me 3 in which they somehow survive, but even then the ending is crap because while you do end up killing the reapers, you end up killing the geth(them cute robot bois) as well as EDI. in my opinion, there is no good ending for mass effect 3, no matter what. they all suck. Who knows, maybe that's what they were going for when they made the endings. maybe the devs wanted to show that while sometimes, we can get lucky and get a pretty good end like in mass effect 1 and 2, we cant always get what we want and that in war, the people we love can die no matter how hard we try to save everyone, that sometimes people will die whether we want them to or not. If they were though, they certainly haven't made that clear to us at all for over a decade. So until they decide to say that that's what they wanted for us to understand and provide proof, I'm still gonna say that the endings are complete bullshit because i wanted to see my commander Shepard settle down with Tali'vas Normandy on a nice place on earth. That's all im gonna say about ME 3 since i took up alot of time with it. While the Mass effect 3 endings are complete Trash, That is overpowered by both Mass Effect 1 and 2 and that's why you should buy this game. Well worth the money",

Every part of it - other than the worldbuilding - is a miss. Combat doesn't work, there is zero character development, the RPG part is a non-entity, the Mako is bad, and major plot points aren't even really incorporated. But, if you focus on main content, it's a breezy 10 hours or so.\r\n\r\nThen and now, it is crazy how much better a game Mass Effect 2 is. It's like they finally delivered the game they intended. I haven't finished it yet, but I will, and quickly as I am struggling to put it down. It doesn't feel like a dated experience at all. Plus, with all the DLC incorporated from the start, there are a lot of characters and experiences I missed the first time. Combat is tight and fun. Spells are more useful and interesting. The scanning mini-game is addictive and relaxing. Characters, with their loyalty missions, are much more interesting. \r\n\r\nI never actually played Mass Effect 3 - I was taking a break from video games and its original release had so much baggage. But, with 2 being so fun, I cannot wait to finally dive in.\r\n\r\nNote: Review written after Mass Effect 1 and most of Mass Effect 2.",

Summer break was when I first played the first and second game and thought it would be a great nostalgia kick to come back during the summer!\r\n\r\nThis trilogy is one of the best ever made, and definitely deserves a play through if you have not done so yet. Do not listen to these idiots complaining about the EA client, these are the same people who complained about EA taking over for Mass Effect 2 onward, to then now praise the second entry to be the best in the trilogy. The game(s) just need the client to boot the game up, you don't need to do anything with it other than maybe make an account. Once you close the game so does the EA client. \r\n\r\nTo those commenting about your hatred towards the EA client, shut the hell up, grow up. It's not that serious you will live I promise.",

You cannot use origin anymore, and even cracks do not seem to bypass the launcher anymore. After nearly 30 hours in ME1 I can no longer play this game. What a joke.\n\nUPDATE:\nI was able to force it to use Origin using a github repository and have yet to have problems again. A shame that this had to be done. Still do not recommend.",
