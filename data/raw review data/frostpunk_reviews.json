Time and time again, I find myself incredibly frustrated given the lack of breathing room. \nPlaying on easy settings, with a customized map, just to get familiar with the mechanics, sees the weather jump to -70 after several turns.\n\nThis isn't a strategy game - it's rather a \"make the right choice\" and survive until the next round. Once you learn by trial and error the correct sequence of choices, then the game is reduced to a series of predetermined moves with the same outcome.\n\nThe game is too masochistic to be enjoyed. There needs to be a balance between reward/risk without turning off the player with a consistent barrage of challenges.",

A few days ago, I said to myself \"let's give it a try\". \n\nMy god, what an experience. The learning process of the game is both easy and enjoyable. The situation, graphics, musics and given choices are truly makes you feel you're inside the game. Sometimes your people lose faith in you and you have to use force for their sake. There have also been occasions when I have felt like a dictator. You're playing as a chaotic good role. There is no bad choice, there is the most suitable choice for the conditions.\n\nAfter finishing the main story I got goosebumps for real. I strongly recommend to experience this feeling.",

You're never free from their fucking complaining. Like it's my fault that it's cold? Gent bent. Anyway, at first you don't have enough people to do anything, then you have too many people and don't have enough resources. Something is always lacking. It's a losing game.

All that is in the first scenario, each one has its own challenges\r\n and consequences on your people and your mind.  100% recommend to friends that claim they are good at city builders/ survival games, do you have what it takes so save humanity or is the frost going to freeze your spirits.",

Admittedly once you go through each of these once regardless of the scenario you are playing, you've exhausted the shiny new option feeling of the choices each branch gives you. You have different moral options available (outside of the Order/Faith branches), in a way that lets you play it mostly neutral, or an extremity of either dictatorial or benevolent leadership depending on your inclination. There's enough nuance in these choices that the game is worth playing if you enjoy city builders that have a good balance of micro and macro management aspects (you decide where citizens work in what concentration in order to adjust your resource profits in a way that fits the scenario and playstyle you've chosen, as well as deciding which/how many of each type of building to make/upgrade). \r\n\r\nEssentially if you enjoy macro/micro strategy games that have bullet point goals to achieve throughout a playthrough and/or are looking for a city management game that has a melancholy atmosphere, you'll enjoy the game. I've written this on a whim after the sequel game has come out, but as a newcomer to the genre I'd say it's worth playing this game before delving into the sequel.",

Sure, enforcing child labor or any number of other unethical choices may make colony life easier, but at what cost? Could the colony have survived otherwise? The game is unflinching in its judgement.\n\nFrostpunk is first and foremost a resource management game, and the colony is nearly always under the gun from some sort of pressure. That pressure comes in the form of deficiencies in resources, manpower, research, or social cohesion. The tension is maintained by a variety of twists and turns over the course of a scenario that require on-the-fly adjustments.\n\nI would highly recommend Frostpunk for those interested in a challenging resource management city builder.",

I do think it won't be for everyone for the very reasons above.\n\nBecause the game is so carefully balanced in order to make just existing in the environment itself a challenge, the game is a frantic race against time.  I never had an over abundance of resources till the last few days, where the resources didn't matter anymore.  I ignore wide parts of the tech tree in order to do what felt like the most important basics to live.  I also restarted about 5 times at the start of the game, because build order of day 1 is critical.\n\nThat's all to say, the game is pretty stressful.  This isn't a cozy game, nor can you really sit back and let it play itself, you need to actively min-max which is unusal in the genre.\n\nOn the other hand, if you find cozy city builders boring and too easy - this is the game for you.",

Each scenario was an interesting, different challenge to have to solve. The DLC added two more interesting scenarios to that list also. Fully recommend it as a resource management and problem solving game.",

Playing all the scenarios for 50+ hours is something I did not initially expect, but was very enjoyable all the way through. However, it is possible to spend even more quality, thinking hours if you want to collect all the achievements or just do the many choices better or just challenge yourself more.\r\nDefinitely a must play for anyone who wants their decisions to matter and is drawn to this type of survival scenario either due to the needed ingenuity of technical solutions used to survive or due to the interest in human behaviour in such situations.\r\n10/10 would do it again.",

Our Children put to work in hot houses to help feed us.. at least it is a safe job.\r\n\r\nI'm off to the Workshop. We've been ordered to research a weather balloon to scout the Ice Shelf for potential survivors... though I worry with the Captain mentioning Children as top priority.. he's been harassing the council to push a new law, yet we've only just arrived. I worry for what storms brews within his mind.\r\n\r\nOur children... occupying the mines whilst Foreman whip them to make them work... everything is run by the small hands of our children... and yet my fellow Englishman watch and do naught.

The main campaign was just the right difficulty, where I was uncertain whether I would actually make it past the storm. Kept me at the edge of my seat, and was very enjoyable for sure :)\r\n\r\nA note on the ending: [spoiler]The talks about morality in the ending are a bit silly, since if you vote specific laws and see an ending, the narrators talk about how we have gone too far (i went with faith), so in my case how faith was abused, saying how the city survived, \"but was it worth it?\" Which is downright stupid since who cares what systems were abused, better than everyone dying to the cold, the leader did what he had to to make sure that the most people possible survived, even if they didn't really have a great time. Which to confirm, not having a great time is still better than dying to frostbite. Drastic circumstances require drastic measures. [/spoiler]\r\n\r\nI did play around a bit with the scenarios, quite enjoyable, least to say the wide plains are simply overpowered since you have space to do everything, at some point on my endless run the entire outer ring was just supply depos, which had enough rations of coal for about a year (was playing it on easy, did not test out hard difficulty).\r\n\r\nNonetheless a great experience",

The music is hauntingly beautiful and the graphics really give the post-apocalyptic feel. Losing at this game doesn't feel punishing because it's a fun game. I learn from my mistakes and do better in the next game. Every minute matters and every resource matters, so make it count to survive! There are good online guides if you need help. There are a few maps, but it has nice variety in settings and scenarios. If you really like the base game then go for the DLCs. It's a good way to test yourself as a leader.",

        "review": "Rating: 8/10\r\n\r\nFrostpunk is a gripping city-builder with a unique survival twist, where every decision has real consequences. Managing resources in a frozen wasteland while trying to keep the last remnants of humanity alive creates a constant sense of urgency. The choices are tough—balancing hope and despair, deciding whether to be a benevolent leader or a strict authoritarian. These decisions don’t just shape your city’s development; they force you to confront the morality behind every choice.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is incredibly rewarding, with each scenario offering distinct challenges that test your management skills in different ways. Whether you’re dealing with limited coal, struggling to keep the generator running, or facing food shortages, there’s always something pushing you to adapt and find creative solutions. The difficulty curve is steep, but that’s part of what makes the game so satisfying. Frostpunk doesn’t hold your hand—it forces you to think ahead and manage crises with limited resources.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics are polished and intuitive, making it easy to get lost in the game’s world. Each new technology unlocks exciting possibilities, and the city-building aspect feels smooth and responsive. However, some of the achievements are a bit too demanding, requiring a level of precision and replayability that can be overwhelming for more casual players.\r\n\r\nAs for the DLCs, they are well worth diving into, each expanding the game’s scope in meaningful ways. However, after a while, the core gameplay can start to feel a bit repetitive. By the time I had explored all the content, I was ready to move on.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Frostpunk was a game that kept me hooked for a long time. I enjoyed the challenge, the tough decisions, and the bleak atmosphere, but I see no reason to go back to it now. Some of the achievements were just too much for me, and while the experience was deeply rewarding, it’s one I’m happy to close the book on. Now, I’m excited to see what the sequel brings!",

Instead of making a certain amount of progress over the course of weeks or months, perhaps leading up to an incoming event (like how the main storyline goes), in the secondary stories you MUST create an entirely  post-apocalyptic civilization in less than 4 weeks, otherwise you are a terrible ruler and your people will overthrow you and end you :) makes total sense.\n\nAs long as the game remains in a state of balance where I could complete the game on Extreme difficulty if I get a lucky enough start, the game will not be good. It needs a full rebalance, or rather mod support, but with Frostpunk 2 out, this game has been sunset and there's no reason to buy it, kept in this garbage state.",

        "review": "[b]TL;DR:[/b] Great fun for a while, but becomes boring too quickly. Also the UI / UX / usability aspects are underdeveloped. Thumbs up because it is brilliant for about 10 hours, then this game tends to waste your time. You will notice the little annoying details where it needed more polishing.\n\n[b]Full Take:[/b]\nGetting started is too hard. As soon as you know how to stabilize your city, it's very good for a couple of hours, and this is where this game truly shines. You can spend an entire night to binge it and that's great. Having success and expanding feels very rewarding. But towards the end of a scenario, there is not much left to do. It becomes very stale. So the pacing of the gameplay is not equally spread. Early, mid and late game should be more similar in terms of difficulty, activities and decisions to make. Also the random events sometimes can make it too hard or too easy.\nThe worst and most annoying part of this game is the presentation:\n- The buildings look too similar. It's hard to distinguish them.\n- Economy needs more details. I was disappointed when I couldn't get a nice table of the data.\n- No clear arrangement of structures: you cannot quickly highlight all medical / storage / industrial buildings, houses, etc.\n- For example, when there are a lot of ill people in your city, there is no quick way to show in which medical facility the patients are. You have to click through every building. Then you have to click the special healing ability in each of the buildings. There should be a more convenient way. This leads to some annoying clicking work when you want to micro-manage.\n- There should be more automation in terms of micro-managing. Like \"automatically turn on heating in a building when it's cold\".\n- The circular grid around your central generator is a nice idea, but the implementation is lackluster, especially considering the weird sizes of the buildings.\n\n[b]Final Thought:[/b]\nThe first ~10 hours are awesome, then are many annoying details that you will notice the longer you play. Have fun but quit before you start sinking too much valuable time into the boredom to come.",

Each of the scenarios has set events (e.g. weather, injury, disease, riots) that you have to manage, keeping you engrossed from the start to mid game to end game of each scenario.\n(e) there is a beauty in the cold, frosty climate with warm glow of the central generator.\n(f) there is an ease of making all commands with its accessible User Interface (UI),",

In other words, my (!)impression(!) is, there are 12 problems needing resource, and only 10 resources available.\nSo far this was constant, hence the impression, along with the very little action one can take, then fast forward time and keeps waiting for the next day.\n\nSeen far too many games in the genre to prejudice and believe the whole concept is built around that.\n\nPossibly will play a little longer to get deeper in the game as again, I'm at 0.01% right now and will happily change the review if it turns out I was wrong and heavy-handed too early in the game, but so far not so good.",

I wish there were 5 more scenarios to struggle through.\n\nThe second to last scenario was insanely difficult for me, and the last was a bit easy, but they were both still great.\n\nOne of the few games where I genuinely cared about the background and story and connecting the dots.",

        "review": "Really sad I didn't try this game out years ago, and this is one more piece of evidence to my theory that indie gaming really had a golden age in the 2015-2018 range.  If you had released it this year it would have been one of my favorites to come out.  It's a city manager but really takes some of the basics of the genre in a different direction.  The conceit of fighting against this oncoming frozen apocalypse creates some interesting decision making about how you heat and layout your colony, use coal, who is out in the cold and who isn't, and preparing for changing weather and unexpected events.\n\nThe thing I like most about this, in most similar games you have all of these buildings like resource storage and medical facilities and ways to mitigate disaster that if you're good, you just aren't using, you should be keeping your resources spent enough you don't have to waste any on building storage facilities, if you screwed something up and significant numbers are getting sick, you need to reload something further back because you've started a downward spiral you just should have avoided.  In this game, people are getting sick.  You feel the winter in this game, people are being sent out into a cold where some of them are going to come back in bad shape, your question isn't if your hospitals are going to be overflowing capacity, but how much of your resources are you going to spend trying to save a few more people and how shady are you going to get trying to mitigate the problem.  How many groups of refugees are you turning away, are you using child labor so you can get the heat up sooner, are you going to just euthanize those that are probably not going to make it anyway to free up the beds for people who are going to die without help.\n\nThe game has a boom and bust cycle, if you send out scouts you can't be sure what they're going to find in the wasteland when exploring, weather patterns change your current needs, events and some plot points can hit you with unexpected issues, and so on, so essential to the game is taking advantage when things are good and burning through resources and making due when things are bad, and timing that right and planning for the unknown unknowns are critical.  Every time I would think \"oh well the game wouldn't do that to me\" it is the kind of game that definitely will do that to you, but in a way that's reasonable, not in a random punishing way but like, \"yeah it makes sense the refugees I agreed to help were almost all sick and unable to work when they arrived after trudging for weeks through wasteland\" or \"yeah it makes sense the first time I sent people out to fix that thing it didn't work and now I need to rip another one of my critical buildings apart to get another steam core if I want to try again.\"  Reasonable, but unfair.\n\nYou're playing well outside the colony management playbook, almost imagine another colony sim game where you've definitely lost, you're watching everything fall apart, but for whatever reason you've just stubbornly decided you're not reloading, you're going to play out the save to the bitter end, and you're pulling off every tricky bs move you can think of to make things last just a little bit longer, deconstructing some buildings, move some people around, intentionally letting some of your population die if you have to, wildly spend resources to keep things going, make deals with the devil if you have to just to get a few more days, that's the perpetual state you are in from the moment you start until the end.  This also has the side effect of making it a self balancing game, i.e., the game is a lot easier if you just turn away almost everyone and generally be as unethical as possible, but how much boyscout nonsense can you get away with before you've doomed everyone, remembering, again, that the game will not be even handed with you.\n\nIt also has a bunch of additional scenarios after you complete the main game that are quite good.  I think the replay value on the main campaign would hold up reasonably well, the fact that there's a half a dozen extra scenarios that feel like they could almost be seperate solid games is amazing, which change up your starting situation in interesting ways and give you a different plot and events and local wasteland to explore, like starting out with a colony of all scientists trying to keep a seed bank from freezing which limits the kinds of jobs you can do but changes your priorities considerably (no one has to live! your goal is to automate), or playing a group of revolutionaries who will refuse to turn away anyone.",

The game looked daunting—overly complicated, slow, and definitely not for beginners. Spoiler: all of that’s true. But despite its harsh learning curve, it’s an experience worth the struggle. Cold, challenging, and deeply satisfying—Frostpunk is the survival game you didn’t know you needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPros: \"The Warm Glow of Victory\"\r\n+ Simple Yet Engaging Strategy: At its core, Frostpunk is a city-building sim, but it’s dressed in survival-horror clothing. It taps into that SimCity-loving part of you, with just enough dystopia to keep you hooked.\r\n+ Addictive Gameplay Loop: Once you crack the tough mechanics, the game becomes hard to put down. The constant battle for survival keeps you on edge, always coming back for \"just one more day.\"\r\n+ Scenario Variety: If you’re ready to throw in the towel on one campaign, you can jump into different scenarios, offering a nice change of pace without starting over entirely.\r\n+ Unique Strategic Decision-Making: Every choice matters, and it often feels like you’re weighing the survival of your entire population with each decision.\r\n\r\nCons: \"The Bitter Winds of Defeat\"\r\n– Daunting Learning Curve: This game doesn’t care if you’re new or if you read the manual. It’ll drop you straight into the cold without so much as a guide, leaving you to Google your way through basic tasks.\r\n– Clunky UI: The interface can feel unintuitive. Trying to figure out why your buildings are freezing despite being in a heater’s radius can drive you mad. Expect a lot of \"trial and error\" moments.\r\n– Frustrating Mechanics: Sometimes, no matter how well you think you're managing things, it feels like you’re fighting an uphill battle. The game seems to enjoy watching you squirm.\r\n\r\nNeutral: \"The Permafrost of Repetition\"\r\n+/- Scenario Similarity: While there are several scenarios to choose from, after a while they start to feel pretty similar. It's still cold, you're still struggling, and the mechanics don’t change much from one to the next.\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\nFrostpunk is a tough but rewarding strategy game. It’s not beginner-friendly, and the UI can be a hassle, but once you push through the initial frustration, the sense of accomplishment is immense. If you’re into city-building with a dark survival twist, this game will keep you hooked. Just be ready for a steep learning curve and a few moments of rage.",

It is a game and you play to have fun, well these two games are not that for me.  I have played over 350 hrs and completed several of the games including the fall of  Winterhome. \nWould like to try Frostpunk 2, but am sure, being made by the same Dev's, the people will have the same spineless attitude.\nIf the Ukraine people had an attitude as the folks in this game, they would have given up and shot themselves.\n",

Also being able to pause the game is very handy, especially when every moment can cost/earn you a resource.  The sound track is well composed, and appropriate, as it sets the dire stage that you are on.  The learning curve is critical as it took me five attempts before I could survive.  Well done - all without a single rocket, cannon or pistol shot.",

So you either have to get used to it, or get severe anxiety\r\n- Doctors, researchers, technicians, are called \"engineers\"\r\n- Sawdust is a great MSG, uncle R*ger would be proud. Safety is not guaranteed, tho\r\n- Have you ever wondered what meat they are eating?\r\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna continue becoming a bad leader because I can't put this game down.\r\n\r\n11/10 great game!",

It's themes and atmosphere are unparalleled, the soundtrack is a thing of beauty, it's replayability is superb and the main story is just so good with an ending that will make you hold your breath along the citizens of your city. I love this game and if you some depressing and deep stuff about society, this is a no-brainer. Although, please play the game on easy difficulty when you start, it's really punishing. The Rifts and On the Edge DLCs are not that great, but The Last Autumn is awesome!",

I felt no sorrow as these people slowly died to the final storm.  \r\n\r\nIf anything, I was annoyed at the constant notifications during the final storm about the townspeople's sniffles.  By that point, nothing I could do would change the fate of my city.  My city survived the final storm, but the sharp increase in difficulty at the end just felt like the devs screwing me over.

        "review": "Holy crap, I just realised that I've never reviewed this game in over five years since I first played it. Anyway, on with it then.\r\n\r\nFrostpunk is, to my knowledge, one of if not the first kind of survival city-builder games on the market. Many city-builder games generally tend to focus on the building mechanics, with some occasionally featuring a military element here and there.\r\n\r\nThis game has none of that. Though building placement is a main feature, the key drive is to keep your settlement alive in the frozen wastelands by maintaining the Generator, a marvel of Victorian-era technology and the last symbol of the dying British Empire's power before the world became shrouded in snow.\r\n\r\nFrostpunk's main campaign scenario sees you trying to keep your settlement intact as its residents brace themselves for the Great Storm. In addition to harvesting resources, you're confronted with difficult choices that can negatively impact the populace's level of hope. Should discontent rise high enough, exile to a frosty death in the wastelands is your end.\r\n\r\nThe other campaign scenarios tend to be shorter, but are no less impactful, as they deal with the circumstances that are adjacent to the main one. In the case of The Last Autumn DLC, you have to build the Generator before the Great Frost sets in.\r\n\r\nThe game's other mechanics are also of interest. Heat, of course, is the main thing that keeps everything in working order. Having to keep everybody warm enough against the amount of coal you can mine is one of the more challenging aspects. Similarly, feeding the populace and ensuring they don't fall ill too frequently will grind your gears in the early part of a given scenario, and practically throughout all of it if you choose to play on the higher difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe research for newer buildings & passive effects is relatively simple enough (compared to Frostpunk 2's system) but you can get stuck should you lack the sufficient resources to do so. And scouting is a matter of both luck and timing, lest your exploration teams perish in the frostlands. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect of the game is its Book of Laws. The Purpose laws are generally immediate in their effects, while the Adaptation laws take time to do so. While Purpose's impact is generally benign, one ought to be careful when dealing with Adaptation. The right number of laws will serve to benefit your society, but go too far and it can spiral out of your control.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Frostpunk is a unique twist on a saturated genre. The only drawback is that developer 11 Bit Studios did not make the game moddable, which is a shame as it would've greatly extended the game's replayability. I gathered that they've somewhat addressed this in Frostpunk 2 with a modkit. Hopefully, if Frostpunk 3 ever gets made, they return back to the basics but this time with modding features.\r\n",

I wasn't actually sure why, the atmosphere is great, the OST is awesome and the gameplay is solid, but then I realized that the difficulty is 100% based on \"did you build the right thing in anticipation of what the game will throw at you next?\" which is knowledge you can only acquire by repeatedly playing the game. You need to know ahead of time how cold things are going to get, how you can ensure you have enough coal stored to heat everyone, the exact number of hunters/farmers needed to keep the city fed, where you can find more steam cores/extra citizens...\r\n\r\nAs a result, playing the game feels almost masochistic, as the game punishes you for not being aware of events that happen in the future due to a lack of experience, as gathering resources and building structures is too slow to manage your city reactively. This forces you to restart your game, try things out until you get past the hurdle that killed your city last time, then you hit the next hurdle, where the process repeats itself until you get past the scenario. Then you can either try a different scenario or up the difficulty.\r\n\r\nLike I said, the atmosphere alone is a reason to play this game, but you're going to struggle to enjoy playing through every bit of content the game has. I for one got pretty tired of trying a new scenario, then getting shot in the proverbial leg for not knowing I needed a specific setup to get past the next temperature drop and being unable to recover because all my citizens were now mad at me.",

I bought it on sale out of curiosity due to the excellent reviews, as well as vaguely remembering a lot of advertising for the game years ago. Best purchase I made. \nThe game is addictive, desperate and punishing. It sounds bad, but it's extremely catchy. One thing that surprises is the connection we created with the game because we wanted to save and avenge the people in a desolate scenario. \nI challenge you to give it a chance and realize how fantastic it is. And yes, you will lose lots and lots of times eheheh.",

I will say that the developer doesn't seem to understand what \"easy\" means in the difficulty selection.  I'm trying the \"Endurance\" scenario and it hits you with -70 degrees before you have a chance to upgrade your generator or develop adequate coal supplies. Very disappointing. One other problem is similar to other games of the sort. It's really hard to tell many of the building types from one another. I get that this is hard to do, one way to help is to have a \"building type selector\" so you can highlight all buildings of a certain type from a drop-down selector.",

Even the normal difficulty is brutal if you don't know what you're doing.  Your people will freeze and start to starve if you don't get things in order fairly quickly.  Recommend to anyone who likes survival builders/apocalyptica sims.  Good cutscenes.  Good exploration UI once you understand how your scouts deploy.  You'll need research.  Start early.  Scooped the full content pkg on sale and I'm glad I checked this game out!  8.5/10 (so far).",

The game’s artistic graphics, combined with its unique sound design, fully immerse the player in the frozen, desperate world.\r\n\r\nChallenging Gameplay: The game strikes a good balance between resource management and ethical decision-making. Every decision you make about allocating resources or setting city priorities can have significant consequences, forcing the player to always think strategically.\r\n\r\nStrong Story and Ethical Dilemmas: The game’s narrative and random events fit well with the gameplay. You are given the ability to enact different laws that directly affect your community, but many of these decisions lead to moral dilemmas, adding depth to the game.\r\n\r\nExceptional Resource Management Design: Managing vital resources like food, coal, and manpower is cleverly designed, requiring the player to carefully decide how to allocate limited resources in the most effective way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSteep Difficulty Curve: The gameplay may feel overly difficult and frustrating for some players. Even with careful strategies, the game can be unpredictable and challenging, which might lead to frustration for some.\r\n\r\nRepetitive Challenges: While the initial ethical and strategic decisions are engaging, after a while, some of these decisions and challenges may feel repetitive, which could reduce the depth of the gameplay.\r\n\r\nLack of Variety in Modes: The game focuses on limited modes, and once the scenarios are completed, the gameplay potential feels somewhat limited. Post-release content has addressed this issue to an extent, but more variety could still have enhanced the experience.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nFrostpunk is a standout game in the survival and resource management genre, presenting players with a dark and challenging world. Despite some drawbacks like limited content variety and steep difficulty, the game offers a unique and engaging experience thanks to its strong atmosphere, exceptional artistic design, and strategic gameplay.",

Every other scenario is basically how much the game settings can make your survivability worse, and how you will deal with it.\n\nOf course you're forced to get creative - and face moral challenges, yes, why not - hence try new strategies. But if you're like me and want to be the most benevolent leader you can, man you're in for a hard time. Very hard time. \n\nSince I don't want to contribute to your long backlog of games, think it like this. If you want to play this game, think long term. Otherwise buy it on discount and play the stories you fancy the most: you've tried something challening and new at a good price, and then moved on.",

        "review": "I went years not thinking that this game was for me because of the difficulty, especially when playing on Xbox (where I originally purchased it), and bruh. This game is great! So much easier to manage on the PC. I had a couple failed play throughs, which still irritated me to an extent, but I was hooked enough to keep trying again, and once I got the hang of it, I LOVED it. Super happy I gave it another shot, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good, challenging (first few playthroughs) city builder.\nI got so excited over it that I went and bought Frostpunk 2, and I will say that it is a whole other experience, and to be honest, I'm a little too overwhelmed to enjoy both of them at the same time right now. I instead will continue playing this one until I am satisfied at which point I will move on and figure out what is going on with the second.",

        "review": "Происходящее отдает неприкрытым идиотизмом с самого начала, когда нам показывают печку Емели на стероидах и бредущих куда-то людей. Ехать внутри чудо-теплушки? Залезть на броню? Хотя бы сделать пару шагов в сторону и идти по проделанной колее? Нет, мы будем ковылять к светлому будущему по сугробам до подбородка!\r\n\r\nИтак, выжившие [spoiler]из ума[/spoiler] добрались до какого-то кратера с непонятной целью, непонятно как спустили теплушку, непонятно как спустились сами. И ради чего все это? Почему нельзя было остаться в городе? Там, может, тоже холодно, зато мародерствовать проще, а стены зданий защищают от ветра. Но нет, в палатках в жопе мира местным шизикам почему-то лучше.\r\n\r\nЗачем было забираться туда, где волки срать боятся (в буквальном смысле - в игре вы не встретите ни одного срущего волка)? Откуда вокруг взялись аккуратные кучки ресурсов, которые даже снегом не запорошило? Так много вопросов и совсем нет ответов.\r\n\r\nДальше больше. В качестве центрального здания люди строят огромную печь, которая обогревает все, кроме домов. Хватит греть воздух, проложите трубопровод в здания! Металл для этого имеется. Делать мы этого не будем, но можем построить мини-печки посреди улицы, которые тоже будут греть воздух.\r\n\r\nОтдельный маразм - это очень короткий рабочий день. Люди делают все, чтобы сдохнуть. Дело происходит в Англии в конце XX века, когда 8-часовой рабочий день вводился лишь локально и в рамках экспериментов. В реальности нормой были рабочий день в 12 часов, несколько смен и детский труд. Нарубить угля ночью? Давать детям посильные задачи с самого начала? Напрячься, чтобы не голодать и быть в тепле? Нет, мы лучше будем ворчать на нашего лидера и сдохнем! А когда начнем дохнуть, то разозлимся на лидера еще сильнее, что он нас не уберег. Хорошо хоть, что люди не требуют выходных и праздников.\r\n\r\nНеумение строить большинство зданий намекает на то, что мы управляем пещерными людьми. Они могут поставить палатки, но не могут сделать нормальный сруб, для этого нужно исследовать несколько технологий. Дороги не имеют смысла. Какова их цель? Грамотно распределять ресурсы? Нет, дороги бесплатные. Упростить жизнь людям, прокладывая оптимальные маршруты? Так они все равно не пользуются дорогами и чешут напролом через сугробы.\r\n\r\nЗаконы можно выпускать только с определенной периодичностью, их нельзя отменять, а некоторые законы друг другу противоречат по непонятной причине. Например, нельзя обучить часть детей инженерному делу, а часть первой помощи. Либо все дети инженерят, либо клизмы ставят, третьего не дано.\r\n\r\nСоциальная составляющая игры - отдельное дно. У взрослых есть 2 гендера - рабочий и инженер. Речь идет не о современности, когда инженер и рабочий должны понимать базовые задачи друг друга. Речь идет о конце XIX века, когда инженер был редким и образованным кадром, а рабочий дешевой низкоквалифицированной силой. В игре же вся разница между этими категориями в том, что инженеры могут исследовать и лечить, а рабочие охотиться. Да и сами инженеры не редкие и ценные, как ожидается с самого начала.\r\n\r\nКстати, о людях. Это ресурс, и не более того. Разработчики наделили каждого болванчика именем, но по факту это просто еще один ресурс. Индивидуальности между поселенцами нет с самого начала, а когда их количество переваливает за 200, ее становится еще меньше.\r\n\r\nЭкспедиции проводятся с помощью воздушного шара, чьей вместительности позавидует любая маршрутка в час пик. У меня в одной корзине запросто помещается 5 человек из экспедиции, 30 с лишним беженцев, более сотни единиц ресурсов (наверное, это несколько тонн) и какой-то чудо-модуль для строительства крутых зданий. При этом никто из этих людей не замерзает, не ест, не болеет и появляется в лагере всегда в отличном состоянии.\r\n\r\nОчень странно, что почти обойден стороной вопрос удобства. Недостаток домов только снижает настроение людей, но я не заметил, чтобы ночующие на улицах чаще болели. Одежда так вообще отсутствует, хотя сама идея игры весьма определенно подталкивает к ее введению.\r\n\r\nПосле преодоления первого кризиса в поселении появляется группа враждебно настроенных лондонцев. Они говорят \"здесь живется плохо, давайте свалим обратно в Лондон по холоду и сугробам без возможности обогреться туда, где мы точно не выживем\", а люди им отвечают [spoiler]\"А давайте!\"[/spoiler]. Вы думаете, лондонцы просто соберут манатки и свалят? Да щас! Они еще две недели будут жить в поселении, ныть и изредка избивать патрульных, продолжая при этом добросовестно работать на предприятиях.\r\n\r\nЛюди начинают замерзать в -20, а в -50 им даже в домах холодно. Непроизвольно возникает вопрос - как же в Сибири на воздухе работают примерно при таком же диапазоне температур? Причем в игре температура всегда кратна 10 градусам, нет никаких плавных изменений, только резкие аномальные перепады. А температура под -100 окончательно превращает происходящее в какой-то анекдот про совершенно другую планету.\r\n\r\nНо я все сюжет и атмосферу, хотя видно, что их даже не пытались создать. Поговорим про геймплей, ведь ради него обычно и покупают игры. А он тут устарел лет на 20. Помните старые экономические стратегии Caesar, Pharaoh, Zeus? Помните, как надо было решать сиюминутные проблемы поселения, одновременно думая над грамотной застройкой районов и организации логистики? Помните, как надо было расставлять приоритеты? Во Фростпанке геймплей примитивен до невозможности - если не хватает жилых домов, строим жилые дома. Не хватает ресурсов - добываем ресурсы. Холодно - исследуем технологию \"как положить дрова в костер\". Не нужно пытаться удовлетворить разные слои населения и не нужно думать о застройке, достаточно ставить здания как попало.\r\n\r\nСтарые экономические стратегии сейчас устарели, но для своего времени многие из них были весьма неплохи и оригинальны, а здесь у нас просто примитивная и кособокая головоломка. Все здания/приказы/исследования делятся на суперкрупые, адекватные и бесполезные, но вы не знаете, что вам пригодится наперед, пока не станет слишком поздно. Есть только одна верная стратегия, и отклонение от нее усложняет жизнь. Короче, над балансом здесь работали так же, как над сюжетом.\r\n\r\nНу ладно, перейдем к плюсам. Их можно пересчитать по пальцам одной руки рабочего из игры, у которого половина пальцев уже отморожена. Плюс первый - это оптимизация. Системные требования адекватные, загрузки быстрые, что сейчас является большой редкостью. Плюс второй - оформление. Звуковое сопровождение хорошее, картинка приятная глазу.\r\n\r\nВердикт. Представьте пазл, который вы должны собрать с закрытыми глазами на ощупь. В первый раз это унылая игра в угадайку, во второй раз играть не хочется. Впрочем, если вам нравится смотреть на людей, которые демонстративно страдают, то это может даже зайти.",

I felt so helpless 🥶 All hope gone bruh. I watched my citizen count drop, and drop, and when it ended, I actully cried and celebrated like I survived the apocalypse. (Which, we totally did😂 I dont know in what state tho 😂) Such a great game! Got me sweating and thats f cooold😂. I can't belive my people would simply tell me they would not go work 🤠 I could only lament myself at that point like, bestie who's going to keep the generator going???? 😂 Everything went to sh*t, and then they were threatening me, so I made triage, and I was like, broooo there is 200+ people wanting to recieve medical attention 🤠 and of course 100+ died. I was just soooo so scared everything was going to be for nothing, and then they hit me with the \"But was is worth it?\" after I SURVIVED THE END OF THE WORLD and honestly, F you 😂 you try to keep this ungrateful people alive and tell me how it goes. Best part was when days earlier I sended a random dude to the unknown to go find his daughter who scaped us, thinking he would simply die, AND HE CAME BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORM WITH HIS KID. EVERYONE WAS DYING WITH A F GENERATOR KEEPING THEM WARM AND THIS TWO CLOWNS NONCHALANTLY CAME BACK TO OUR HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORM, AND I SIMPLY LOST IT. I love the game already, and I only have played the first escenario😭The only people I ever banished from my city were the ones that wanted all the rules to be gone cuz they were sure they were going to die in the storm 🤠 I was like; im working my a*s off so ctmres like you can live, you ungrateful f b, so go die in the snow, cuz following women in the street is the only thing not allowed in my city, respect.🤠",

It has survival, heavy resource management, decision making that affect your town and also a law system that further shapes your town (or more like survival pit) and can affect your people.\n\nThe immersion is outstanding, from the world, to the UI and a big factor for me, the music, plunge you in this time-critical game where your decisions matter and where there is never enough time to fully prepare yourself to survive what is coming. Some may consider this game stressful. I do too, but in a very good way.\n\nEven though the game only has a set amount of scenarios that you can play through (and also an endless mode), I have never got bored of repeating said scenarios as every play-through kept me at the same level of scrambling for time to manage and gather my resources and develop for the upcoming temperature drops.\n\nWorth every penny even at full price however, the developers sometimes offer it as good discount as well.",

I really did feel a tear fall down my cold face after sending child number 43 into the generator to prevent the fourth melt down, damn engineers can't keep the heat going!. Now you may ask, where were all the adults. Good question, many gave there heroic lives  out in the cold to get more Tesla coils but non ever return =( or froze to death trying to get more people and supply. But what about the other adults? We don't speak of those vile people! all in prison! how dare they try to return to home i save them and this is how i am re-payed! Even my guards couldn't be trusted!  Then on my second play through and becoming the voice of god this game taught me a wonderful lesson.  Absolute power in the hands of the right person or god chosen voice is a good thing.  That and get rid of hope and replace it with something better quickly!\n\nFor the dlc first one is a bridge never got it. last one at release seem like a rush project many bugs and spelling errors but other wise still enjoyable. Last Autumn,  took what was great about the base game, expanded it added great new moral choices and decisions and ramp up how far someone who is by right entitled for absolute power can go! For my first run, i  learnt a harsh lesson make sure you keep a guard tower over every dwelling, cause if just one is outside of your view, damn bloody useless builder will stab you in the back! \n\nFor my second run, i made sure that generator was completed not just on time but way ahead of schedule! along with plenty of supplies too coal steel wood, all you could ask for. Plus threw in a lot of bodies.................. extra meat rations that will be nice and cook when that generator it turn on. I am a good foreman! that will teach those damn builder to question  my orders!\n\nAll in all good game, got really into it. Now i feel like starting a coal mine.",

        "review": "- Audio pops/glitches. First time in my life I had audio issues in a game.\n- Stuttering during the 2D cinematic scenes in a game from 6 years ago in a Ryzen 9 7950X + RTX 3070 computer.. The main game runs fine so it's a bug on their side instead of hardware specification.\n- Interface glitches like resetting animations when opening a menu (which also triggers the audio pops issue). The interface is so polished I don't know how they missing a bug like this in menu we open all the time.\nMaybe it's something with the GOTY version but the game feels buggy.\n\nI could even ignore these annoyances but the game isn't good as a survival/base-building. There is not a lot of freedom or map exploration you would expect from this genre. It's more of a politics management puzzle with a base-building gimmick which is slow and the progression is somewhat scripted if you want to survive. It's a shame because they really nailed the visuals and atmosphere. Most game interfaces nowadays are so bland and basic, this level of polishment is very hard to see.\n\nI heard that Frostpunk 2 improves on the base-building, for the dismiss of who liked the politics management/puzzle stuff, but it sounds much better to me. I'll probably try the sequence instead.",

The graphics is beyond serene, the Sound effect is right on the spot, the ambience is gripping, the story is rich and deep. There's zero lag and bugs, unless you count \"unable to leave the game mid way using alt-tab\", because the game forbids you to use your pc any other way, unless you fully quit the game, which i'm completely fine with. Contrary to most comments saying the game is boring because it only forces you into clearing the game with only one way after multiple trails and errors, and almost seemingly unbeatable, well, it's not.

Every choice matters, whether it’s enacting harsh laws or deciding who gets the last rations. It’s a game that rewards strategic planning but punishes hesitation.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"Frostpunk\" delivers a gripping, thought-provoking experience that keeps you on the edge.

They really weren't holding back when they made this one. It's like a whole game on its own. They almost could have called this Frostpunk 2, though it would definitely be a lateral move instead of the full evolution that the actual Frostpunk 2 seems to be shaping up as.\r\n\r\nThe Last Autumn shakes up the core game's mechanics in interesting ways, most notably by almost entirely ditching the temperature mechanic that defines Frostpunk in large part. It sounds like a game that revolves around temperature management ditching the temperature management for the DLC would be a huge mistake, but they pulled it off by introducing enough new conflicts and factors to keep things interesting.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything that holds it back a bit for me, it's that it's a little on the easy side as far as Frostpunk goes (though I see plenty of people felt the opposite, so I won't hold that against the game — beating the main game and the Fall of Winterhome scenario right beforehand may have over-prepared me). I finished the main objective a full 10 days ahead of schedule and knocked out all of the bonus objectives too with plenty of time to spare. I don't think the game was prepared for me to run things so efficiently because I had nothing left to do for the final 5+ days and ended up just leaving it on fast-forward until the ending arrived. Not an exciting note to end on, which stood in stark contrast to the main campaign and the Fall of Winterhome scenario that both had nail-biting finales. Still super fun and engaging, and an extremely impressive display of ingenuity to reconfigure the game's systems into such a drastically different experience.\r\n\r\n-On the Edge:\r\nIt's truly impressive how these developers were able to find so many new ways to utilize the same core mechanics while consistently upping the difficulty and making things feel fresh, though this one did seem to peak in difficulty early on while the climax was far easier in comparison",

Типичная индюшатина разхайпенная серой массой до состояния золотого телёнка.\nМеханики примитивные, геймплей прост до скуки, каждая ваша \"катка\" будет копией предыдущей, ибо будете проходить тем же способом. А почему? А потому, что игра и палки в колёса от разрабов заставляет вас идти по пути меньшего сопротивления и играть как игра требует от вас, а не как вы хотите.\nВсе сложности возникают как раз от таких вот палок в колёса от разрабов, порой до абсурда. Усложнения сделаны не ради разнообразия и приятного геймплея. А только ради того чтобы растянуть ваш прогресс на часы пока вы методом тыка или узнаете от советов от других игроков не найдете \"мету\" как, что делать в каком порядке чтобы даже на самый высокой сложности вас не сломили в первые секунды вечная нытьё этих изнеженных \"жителей\" и усложнений от разрабов. После того как найдёте всё сведётся как ранее писал к одному и тому же геймплею и пути в создание ваших городов.\n\"Сюжетка\" если её так можно назвать ведь по сути это просто те же карты что и в свободной игре только с парой дополнительных скриптов и немного больше текста в всплывающих окошках, проходится за 6 часов, самая сложная будет сюжетка за Винтерхолд только из-за того в начале вам надо быстро-быстро прочистить и стабилизировать поселение а в конце надо много ресов за таймер собрать. В остальном проще некуда.\nDLC \"сюжетки\" и \"карты\" и \"режимы\" не проходил и не буду. Не хочу покупать длц. Меня эта система длц в играх заебала ещё 5 лет назад.\nА потом я ещё узнал от других игроков, что разрабы известны такими высказываниями как [b]\"All future content will be free\"[/b] а потом смотришь треть-половина игра залочена за платными dlc. Шикарно :)\nСвободный режим это фактически так же сюжетка только меньше скриптов и текста в всплывающих окошках.\nС оптимизацией и запуском никаких проблем не встретил, нормально шло в 2к 140, но невозможность отключить замыливание(Blur) разочаровало.\nВзял чтобы глянуть, потраченного времени жаль.",

        "review": "Frostpunk is a pretty complex game that requires a lot of managing short term problems while trying to plan for the long term and any lack of planning in either regard will either wreck your run early in or have it collapse in the end as you try to manage an ongoing crisis\r\n\r\n--And I love it. I love the way that this game makes you think strategically even if it doesn't exactly require the most creative planning. I think this game also succeeds in creating a very fragile balancing act between the end of the world and whether or not the player decides to maintain the societal norms that existed in a world where order and organization were the backbone of civilization, and it's also a game where often the most moral solution isn't the right one. For example, ceremonial burials will make people happy and retain some normalcy in the most dire times, but if you dump them in a pit and freeze them for use as either organ donors or fertilizer, you'll provide a much needed service to your people. Or cramming people into crowded hospitals. It might not make them happy, but when everyone is frostbitten, ill, and on the edge, it makes sense\r\n\r\nMy major complaint with this game (aside from performance) is that the scale kind of boxes you in and prevents creative thinking. Most runs of each major scenario are likely to play out in a similar way, and when you've played it multiple times, it eventually all becomes second nature which isn't exactly something you want in a game like this. Especially on \"A New Home.\" You rush overcrowding, rush to the automaton, mechanize the city, end with 650 people, and it's over.\r\n\r\nStill, everything from the sound design and music to the world building, visuals, and the way the game requires quick thinking are done phenomenally, and I would recommend this game to anyone, even if they  aren't necessarily fans of RTS/city builders, because that applied to me and I still had a lot of fun.",

        "review": "Frostpunk is a masterclass in combining city-building with survival strategy, offering a compelling and often nerve-wracking experience. One of the game's strongest features is its replayability. The missions are designed in such a way that, even after completing them, you can return with a different strategy and face new challenges. The procedural nature of the events and the way the environment responds to your choices mean no two playthroughs are exactly alike. Each time I’ve gone back to a scenario, I’ve found something fresh that has kept me on edge, forcing me to adapt and reconsider my tactics.\r\n\r\nThe city-building mechanics are highly intuitive but complex enough to demand your full attention. Managing resources, keeping your people warm, and ensuring their survival all require you to balance short-term needs against long-term sustainability. What I particularly enjoyed is the game's pacing when it comes to resource management. Resources are always scarce, but they’re never so limited that you feel helpless—just tight enough to force critical decisions. You’re constantly operating on the edge, and that creates a level of tension that drives the whole experience forward.\r\n\r\nAnother standout aspect is the moral and ethical dilemmas the game throws at you. As the leader of a frozen colony struggling to survive, you're often forced to make decisions that can be brutal. Whether it's enacting child labor laws to keep the coal mines running or deciding whether to provide more care houses for the sick, every choice affects the morale and survival of your people. These dilemmas are not just there for shock value; they add depth to the city-building mechanics and make you consider the human cost of your decisions.\r\n\r\nVisually, Frostpunk’s bleak, frozen world is beautifully rendered, with the cold feeling palpable as your city expands. Watching your city slowly grow into a bustling hub of survival amidst the desolation is incredibly satisfying, and it gives the game an atmospheric edge that pulls you into its harsh reality.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you’re someone who loves strategy games with real consequences, detailed city-building mechanics, and a touch of survival, Frostpunk offers an experience that’s challenging, thought-provoking, and endlessly replayable. The balance of difficulty and reward, combined with its strong narrative elements, makes it a standout title in the genre. It’s one of those games that keeps you coming back, trying to do better, trying to survive just one more storm.",

There was a learning curve but it quickly became addictive and all consuming. There are many roads to success, many hard choices to do, and it is all very satisfying. That final portion of the game in particular was very memorable.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of replayability as the game offer different scenarios and it's probably more fun when you know  your way around the various technologies and upgrades.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend, I'll keep my eye on the sequel for sure.",

It has the balance between the consumption of difficulties and enjoyment. I just can't believe I'll find the perfect game. I thought there was no such thing.\n\nBTW i beat the game on the fifth try, with 10 people left. The feel was so satisfying. I love the game and my advice is, BUY IT! You wont regret.",

Makes me want to buy FP2... I guess that was their intent with the sale. :)",

        "review": "This is a citybuilder game. It has a circular ring design which is somewhat novel, and an aesthetic design which is somewhat unique and well put together. (skip to last paragraph for ADHD)\r\n\r\nWhat this game really has [u]going[/u] for it is a really well structured and compelling narrative, which is also integrated into the visuals and audio (which are both really good). The reason the city is circular is because everybody is freezing to death and the (one) furnace is located in the center of the town, pumping heat out of the earth's core. The steampunk aesthetic almost couldn't be more narratively fitting, and the soundtrack has this dramatic string orchestra style that is just unbelievably gripping. (exaggeration)\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that this game is content short, it can be played in one 24 hour period during, say, semester finals (ask me how I know). There ultimately isn't very much game beyond the highly structured linear storyline. Also, I would say the 'society' progression system is flawed, it feels like the game wants you to progress to fanatical despotism but you can also just not do that? But then, you're just sitting there with a game notification telling you a decision can be made, but the decisions are \"I AM THE MACHINE GOD\", \"IMPOSE THE WILL OF THE DEATH-STATE\" or \"MANDATORY SUPER-CANNIBALISM\". Like, if you want to go with the flow of the game and just go crazy you can. But personally I wouldn't have minded some more 'moderate', or rather less insanely framed, policy progressions. If the author wanted players to pursue these policies I think they should have been narratively mandatory or something the player fights against trying to enforce.\r\n\r\nThe game also isn't that difficult but is very unforgiving if you haven't learned the systems. This is great narratively because the player can be 'burned' by their mistakes while trying to survive, matching the desperate scramble aesthetic of the whole game. But ultimately you are either doing things right, and the game is totally easy, or you aren't, and if you don't get it right bad enough you just have to reload. There aren't many design roadblocks, ways to play, or any real complexity to unravel or engage with. It's not like, a Sim City simulator where you're larping as a civil engineer grappling with road capacity equations or traffic flow schemas. There aren't really even meaningful logistics mechanisms or really anything to create ambiguity and potential for design variety.\r\n\r\nUltimately what I'm saying is that this game is an interactive movie, and the medium of interaction is a shallow but not un-enjoyable citybuilder. You'll love it if you want the story, but if you're into long-play citybuilding games this will probably be disappointing. I don't remember paying as much for this game as it is currently priced at, but on sale I couldn't possibly not recommend it. Also they're making a sequel! So if you want to know if that 60 dollar pre-order (lol) is worth it you should probably play its predecessor which is functionally its demo version.",

        "review": "Frostpunk is a standout in the city-building and survival genre, masterfully balancing simplicity with depth. At its core, the game presents basic mechanics: gather resources, manage heat, and keep your citizens alive. However, the beauty of Frostpunk lies in its complexity beneath the surface, making it easy to understand but extremely challenging to master. The game offers a perfect blend of resource management, exploration, and moral decision-making, all wrapped in a haunting, atmospheric narrative.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has spent many hours with Frostpunk, I found that once you get a handle on the mechanics—optimizing your city, keeping your citizens warm and fed, and managing their hope and discontent—it becomes a joy to return to again and again. While the game is relatively short (most of the content can be completed in about 30-40 hours, depending on how quickly you adapt to its challenges), it's the kind of game that pulls you back in for more. Even after mastering the gameplay, I love coming back to create my own little roleplaying scenarios, imagining new stories for the inhabitants of my city as they struggle through the frozen apocalypse.\r\n\r\nThe game may be intense, but that's part of the appeal. It's perfect for a few hours of highly engaging city-building where every decision counts. Whether you're experimenting with different laws, trying new strategies, or just seeing how long your city can last in the harsh environment, Frostpunk keeps you on your toes. It's a short, concentrated experience, but one that keeps you coming back for more—each return a fresh and intense challenge in a world on the brink of extinction.",

Some city builders are about creating a balanced system, but this game will push your spinning plates and make you readjust on the fly. The iteration loop is hours long, and you can fail long before you get a game over. The interesting thing is the moment when you realize that you've messed up, and it's a hopeless situation. I really liked it; I felt pride, hope, shame, despair, fear and relief during my play through. For a jaded person like me, that means a lot. I can recommend this game to anyone who likes a relatively short strategy game with a strong aesthetic. However, if you want a game you can play forever or a power fantasy, it's not one of those.",

Only bought on steam because it was on sale and I wanted to support the developer for creating this amazing game][/i]\n\nFrostpunk has just the right amount of difficulty when it comes to strategy game. In fact, I would say this isn't really a strategy game, more like a city management game.\nYes, the events are very challenging and kinda depressing at times. But it also feels very fresh and rewarding at the end. The music is so damn good. And the cherry on top is that the story is pretty good as well.\n\nI'm probably not going to log any extra hours on steam, I just had to log a few hours to be able to write this review, mainly because the next installment is due 6 days at the time of writing this review. I pray that game comes with decent optimization at launch. Thankfully it's on Game Pass so I won't have to spend extra money to buy at launch.\n\n[h3] An easy 90% rating for me [/h3]",

I've put over 50 hours into Frostpunk so far and I still come back to it for my RTS needs.\r\n  Highly recommend to experienced RTS\\Civ players and new, though new players may find it easier to start with everything on Easy in Endless Mode Custom Maps.",

        "review": "Great city-building/management, emphasis on the management! Your first few play-through's will no doubt be frustrating. I had to restart about 3 times before I got a handle on things. It is especially brutal in the early game and you have to kind of know what techs to research in order to not stunt your city's growth. \n\nI liked the large political aspect in the game as well. It gives you some different ways to manage your citizen's needs and they have their own pros and cons. You can be a kind leader or somewhat of a dictator or even a cult leader. \n\nMy only gripe is that the game could use a little more tutorial as I had a couple starts where I basically killed my city because I didn't know a somewhat vague mechanic. I recommend just reading a little online for the early game to save yourself a restart or two. \n\nI will likely play some of the other scenarios as well. Fun game with great art and sound to boot.",

As a city-builder title, the cylindrical design was new to me as most previous games I've played use a grid but that's a minor point. Trying to balance research and new laws/policies seems simple enough but with some resource management anybody should be able to keep both going around the clock. This is definitely one of the few titles I've come across that makes micromanaging fun. You'll definitely have your fair share of rough starts and more than one failed playthrough but over time, things get easier and make more sense to really draw you in for the next evolution in your society.",

The other scenarios have either a slightly different story or a slightly different story along with a slightly different UI/mechanics so there isn't a lot of difference between the scenarios. It definitely doesn't feel like a new game.\n\nBut the mechanics are fun and the slight story keeps you engaged to try to beat the scenario in your way. So definitely a game to try out for the main story and if you enjoyed that try the other scenarios to see if you like them.",

I have played this game every single year since it came out, usually around Christmas when I am alone and the drinking gets bad and I feel my liver popping out of my right side like Ernest Hemingway. Frostpunk is my only comfort. My menthol cigarette. My gái điếm in Khe Sanh. I would sooner kill a family of four behind the wheel of my 2005 Toyota Corolla than give up my Frostpunk habit.\n\nI have spent most of my 25 years of life hoping against hope that I could be a tyrannical fascistic leader that would send children to work inside of a 150 degree celsisus generator. Frostpunk gives me what I’ve always wanted. To sacrifice children in the name of industrial progress.\n\nSpeaking of sacrifice, the fact that I can send five fathers to die inside of a wrecked piece of high technology, the likes of which humanity will likely never see again (as long as I am in charge), in search of a sketch of a flamingo or something like some New York yuppie really takes the experience up a notch.\n\nOne time, the game asked me if I would order a dying man’s arm amputated in an effort to save his life. I, of course, said yes, but insisted they amputate his legs as well. He died. Good.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that will transform not just your mind, but your very mortal soul in the image of George Nathaniel Curzon, this is the game for you.\n\n5/5 The children yearn for the lumber mill.",

It has survival, heavy resource management, decision making that affect your town and also a law system that further shapes your town (or more like survival pit) and can affect your people.\n\nThe immersion is outstanding, from the world, to the UI and a big factor for me, the music, plunge you in this time-critical game where your decisions matter and where there is never enough time to fully prepare yourself to survive what is coming. Some may consider this game stressful. I do too, but in a very good way.\n\nEven though the game only has a set amount of scenarios that you can play through (and also an endless mode), I have never got bored of repeating said scenarios as every play-through kept me at the same level of scrambling for time to manage and gather my resources and develop for the upcoming temperature drops. \n\nWorth every penny even at full price however, the developers sometimes offer it as good discount as well.\n\n",

When I first tried it I expected to just play a little and then go to bed....\r\nI ended styaing up until 5 am when I was working a couple of hours later. After 80+ hours of I can safely say:\r\nIf you hate:\r\n- Amazing music\r\n- Thinking ahead\r\n- Being forced into making difficult decisions\r\n- Manage limited resources\r\n- Have your gf ask you why you are still up that late....again\r\n\r\nChoose another game\r\n\r\nIf not.

It can get pretty stressful the first go round, but it's good learning for the next run at it, which only gets more fun! Learning curve is not bad at all. Unfortunately for me, I tend to abandon what should be great games when the learning curve is steep and doesn't pull me in early... fortunately for all of us  this is not one of those games",

Don't have enough hunters and they will starve, etc. The end of the main story is a white knuckle struggle to hold on, that is genuinely harrowing, and if you're like me you will will start, and abandon, many saves just learning the correct paths to even get you there.

Makes you straddle the line between \"Oh no we're going to run out of resources if we don't do something quickly!\" and \"Phew, I think we should be fine for a while\" very well. As soon as you think you're comfortable you need to make a horrible choice between something like authorising frostbite amputations and overcrowding medical facilities, or maybe some natural or social disaster throws you off course and you need to deal with it. The time and resource pressure is engaging and the setting and art is stylish and interesting too.\nDefinitely recommended.",

You are there as part of a story, a story the game tells very well using the city-sim format. \r\n\r\nThe initial playtime is not so long, as the scenarios have limited replayability and endless mode doesn't really offer much. I have gotten 230+ hours out of it though, by waiting a year before playing through the scenarios again. The story, the vibe, it always hits home and the core gameplay/strategy feels fresh after the break. A game that is a good addition to my library, doesn't just clutter it up after playing it once. \r\n\r\n",

        "review": "Imagine the settlement as a character. You’re looking after it, growing its population, upgrading it, and keeping an eye on its health and temperature. Then you head off on a journey to rescue other survivors and bring them back to the camp. But the camp’s overflowing, resources are running low, and the temperature’s dropped sharply. Each night, someone dies. The graveyard’s too close to the homes, and it’s impossible to survive indoors. Despair just keeps mounting with every passing day.\n\nIf the whole settlement were one character, this would be the longest, most painful, and agonising death in the game. I’ll need time to get over the wreckage and start again.\n\nThe game is brilliant. The music, the style, the animations. The sounds of the blizzards, the steampunk stoves. The bell that tolls for each new day of suffering.\n\nA masterpiece.",

        "review": "Frostpunk is beautiful, the aesthetic is spot-on, and it very quickly sends you to a dark place of survival in a winter apocalypse. I like the mechanics and how the decisions you make for your settlement fork into other, more difficult, and often more dire, decisions that need to be made. I found the UI to be easy to understand and navigate and thought the controls and strategies were easy to pick up on.\n\nHowever, this game suffers from something I have come to recognize (and despise) in other games and describe as 'artificial difficulty.' Artificial difficulty, at least the way I am going to describe it here, is difficulty that springs from the player not doing things exactly the way the game wants you to do it - basically, egregious amounts of trial and error. It is more akin to punishment than anything else. It became very obvious very quickly that Frostpunk forces you into certain pathways as far as what to build, research, and prioritize, or else you just lose. The repetitive, trial and error feeling comes from the fact that the scenarios seem to be 100% scripted, forcing you to anticipate what the next problem is going to be or else fail. This means that you end up having to memorize your way - one issue or problem at a time - through the play. This, quite simply, is just NOT fun for me. At all. Ever. \n\nI would expect a strategic game in this genre to have several ways to approach problems, but the lack of depth means that some strategies just don't work based on what the scenario is asking you to solve, and in what order. I wonder if a large portion of the buildings and/or research technologies are even worth it, but didn't play enough to get deep into the game to know for sure. When following the tutorial quests still ends up in you losing rather quickly, there is probably something wrong with game balance. It's a shame, because I wanted to like it. If you like the look and feel of it, buy it on sale and give it a try. But for those of you who want more strategic depth and freedom, I would probably urge a strong pass.",

        "review": "This was really fun city-building and management game until I realised that my sick children were actually returning to a tent they call home from 14-hour shift in the coal mines to eat a bowl of sawdust in -120°C, one of his parents working in the pleasure house and the other one was having his organs harvested and beign thrown into an organic fertiliser. All of that and I didn't even bat an eye because all I had was a goal in mind - the city must survive. It was only at the far end of the game when all was over that I suddenly realised the cost of this survival and my heart was burdened by a sense of guilt.\n\nNot sure if it fits the city-builder genre since it's more about managing your resources and decision making as the game goes on, but certainly has some of those features. Do not expect SimCity but in Greenland.\n\nThe soundtrack was also very cool, especially \"The Still, Cold World\" and \"The City Must Survive\" tracks, love it. \n\nIf you get this game make sure you get the additional scenarios too, each having a different themes, goals, challenges and moral dilemmas that are just as good, if not better than the main game. Truly awesome work.",

A city building sim combined with moral choices, hard punishment for failing to plan ahead and a magnificent score and you get Frostpunk. 10/10. And I started playing just in time for the sequel! Looking forward to it very much. Only the last three scenarios left to complete in this one!",

Like other good strategy games I've played, it's impossible to address every issue fully (at least, it has been for me so far). I reached the failstate on my first playthrough, which was a significant learning experience. I'm on my second round now, having learned a lot about what you need to plan for. I can see already that I've made some poor choices my second time through, which is actually fun! I imagine there's quite a bit to learn from this game yet.",

Most of the time I stop playing them because their isn't a story or type of scenario. After watching a video on the game, it intrigued me, and I bought it while one sale. I was hooked almost immediately. After finally completing the normal difficulty of the base scenario, I can easily say this is one of the best and well-polished games I've played in recent memory. If you enjoy a challenge, I cannot recommend this game enough. I have yet to complete the other scenarios from the DLC, but I am still very excited to see the direction they take with the sequel!",

Most toxic relationship I've ever had with a game and I'm not mad about it.\n\nOn a serious note, it's gorgeous, very well done and polished, and really makes you work for the \"win\" (though the \"win\" usually feels more like your grade school teacher looking at your chewed up homework and dusty clothes with pity and passing you anyways because they think maybe you're having a rough time at home).\nYou'll most likely have to retry some of the scenarios a couple of times before you figure it out, so if that's not your thing, then this is probably not going to be your kind of game. You'll have to get used to the rage/defeat quitting because you upgraded the wrong thing at the wrong time or went down the wrong morality branch early on, or you've just been straight up fired as overlord of your colony due to aforementioned incompetence.\nIf this punishment sounds like your thing, then I wholeheartedly recommend this game to you.",

There's nothing like deciding whether or not 4 hours of coal is worth a handful of human lives. Only criticism is that once you've learned the game, it has no more curveballs to throw at you and the outcome is more or less decided in the first 5 days. I want crushing, bewildering difficulty for Frostpunk 2 that doesn't let you get comfy, especially when you're well ahead economically and feeling like a boss. Probably the best OST in the entire industry, It's Poland's world and we're all just living in it.\n\n10/10 game, would enact unnecessary fascism again.",

Well I am being challenged but not in the way I was expecting, it feels like no matter what I do and how many resources I collect, the game wants me to play it a very specific way and I thought these types of games were supposed to be how you want to build your city. Makes me feel restricted and feels very RNG heavy which makes for a bad game design imho. \n\nEverything else about the game is great, story, art and music does help it but doesn't carry or make up for the poor game design. Also the people giving me those weird notifications when I'm trying to speed up the time lapse is annoying which causes the timer to slow down or stop when I don't want it doing either. \n\n\nWish there was a mixed button review because this game would def get that but for now it will get the thumbs down. \n\nAlso its fine to promote your game but doing it to where its the first thing I see when I boot up the game is annoying af.",

And I couldn't really say how my original goal of 'don't die' had led me to become the ruler of a cult of divinity out here in the arctic.  That's the magic of the game- it makes it easier to win if you do terrible things.  And it blurs the line between concepts like 'good' and 'evil' in a way that's interesting and realistic.  Is it really evil to kill a guy to save three hundred others?  What about just saving yourself?\r\n\r\nWorth it for that moment alone.  The gameplay is tight, they don't spoon feed you success, and it's easy to die if you're not paying attention.  If you can beat the main campaign, you earned it.",

No it's much more than that.\nYou are put in charge of a population in a dying world, there is not real \"Victory\" in this cold and unforgiving wasteland.\n\nThe world you knew before is Gone along with the green and warm summers, here there is only Frost and Death.\nBoth of which go hand in hand.\n\nThe Choices you have to make so that your people survive is astonishing to say the least, It's one of the few games where Child Labor is a need not a suggestion with no other alternative.\n\nSure you can try to save everyone, but in the end people will die and the real challenge is recovering from it and maintaining your control over this City.\nThe NPC's or Citizens in this game don't know what you're going through to make sure they survive, you're there for a greater purpose than a couple of Miners which died due to suffocation in the Coal Mines.\n\nIt's been said before, Survival is the only Goal. Whatever it takes and no price is to high.\n\nSympathy is punishable and dereliction is unacceptable, You must refuse to be led by your Morale Compass and instead choose to cover only the very needs of your population, as resources cannot be wasted.\n\nAs if you engage in Gluttony, You will come to know just how harsh Mother Nature can be..\n\n10/10 Game.",

For a city-building game, it allows too little freedom for a player - there is literally 'one way or highway' path to a victory, especially on higher difficulties. You either memorize that needs to be built where or you lose. \r\nReplaying the same scenario twice is not interesting as all the scripted events are repeating exactly. To master your victory, just memorize what needs to be built when and with which settings. Done. But where's fun??\r\nOverall I have enjoyed ancient 'Caesar III' game much more than this fancy one.",

        "review": "It's a nice Steampunk-esque game. Really nice visuals, helpful tutorial. Still lost my first playthrough, but I'm learning. It'll happen. However, when perusing the settings, my eyes espied a particular option: temperature.\r\n\r\nThe game will let you choose which measurement systems to use. Excitedly, I clicked the right arrow: fahrenheit. I clicked again, celcius. I continued clicking, partially due to shock, partially due to amazement.\r\n\r\nThis game will not let you choose to us Kelvin as the thermal measurement unit.\r\n\r\nSo, I obviously have to say I cannot recommend this game, as it's obviously incomplete and is still waiting on the developers to finish adjusting settings, so that they can add an update to add Kelvin in. When they do, I am obviously going to be more than happy to change my recommendation. I just can't bring myself to do it, with the game in the incomplete state that it is in.\r\n\r\nIf you also want to try playing it, despite it's incomplete state, don't let me stop you. I'm just making sure that everyone knows the current state of things, and knows about some of the missing features. Thank you for reading, and have a pleasant day!",

Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nResting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nPreparing the filling:\nBoiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.\nPreparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Sauté the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.\nMaking the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the sautéed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.\nForming the dumplings:\nRolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.\nForming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.\nCooking the dumplings:\nBoiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.\nCooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).\nServing:\nRemoving the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.\nServing: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or sautéed onions.\nEnjoy your meal!",

Then I started playing and it is the hardest thing I've ever done! I failed 2 times and switched it to easy just to prove it can be done. \n\nI love how brutal the game is. It really makes you grapple with pressing issues like 24 hour work shifts and amputation vs. death. I can say that when I watched the 2024 Summer Olympics when I saw the hot air balloon go up I had a bout of PTSD where I was flashing back to when I was in the trenches at -30! \n\nTo sum it up this is like a brutal, hardcore game of civilization 6 where you are building buildings and working plots  preparing for the temperature to drop even more! It's resource management at its finest.",

I had fun with my time with it and my only real gripe is the same as with all of these types of games: they are incredibly fun and you can't put them down for a day or 2, but then you never play them again.",

Normally this wouldn't be a real issue except the game leaves out KEY detail about how buildings function and how strategies work leaving it up to you to stumble through the game to figure it out... While it is fun to come back and play with the new knowledge it starts to feel like a chore. It especially becomes tiresome mid game because it feels like every single mistake is punished brutally.... For that i cant recommend this game, maybe the second game fixed the lack of information on buildings/laws & strategy..... \r\n\r\nIn summary,\r\n\r\nThis game brutally punishes you if you dont have everything pre-planned out making it feel like a repetitive  chore... ill probably continue to play it till i beat it but i wouldnt warrant anyone buying it without doing some heavy research on it first",

And pretty addictive once you get over the how-does-this-work hump.\nIts a tough game which can quickly spiral out of control if you make too many bad calls or let one or two run too long before correcting them.  Having said that, I completed the scenario after a 2-hour trial run to see how the game worked and then managed to complete it on the next run, on the default medium setting.\nThe interface and visuals are good, no complaints at all, very atmospheric!\nLooking forward to the next game on a new scenario.",

Not the kind of city building game where you can just build stuff and wait for the resources to come in. It can take a lot of patience and restarting scenarios over and over again until you learn how to efficiently manage everything. It took me about 2 weeks of daily play (multiple hours a day) to finish the main scenario on hard on Xbox. Once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad. But if you're going at it blindly without any online guides or youtube tutorials, then be prepared for Dark Souls levels of difficulty.",

Personally, it's a must try atleast once for anyone who wants to kick back and devlop a city.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I DISLIKE is I wish when adults,engineers, children get sick they would auto add the unemployed ones to keep up with demand, it doesn't get annoying having to keep adding and subtracting when I'm trying to build requirements. Another thing would be replayability, once you mastered the game there isn't much afterwards. However, 100% think anyone should give this game a shot, not to intensivebut a great game for anyone who wants to get a taste of city planning/urban sprawling.",

This is one of, scratch that, the BEST city building game I have ever played in my life. It takes resource management, risk/reward, foresight AND hindsight, compassion, dictatorship, altruism, and greed to succeed at any of the scenarios. You may think to abandon your moral compass to succeed, and sure the kids only lost a SINGLE hand in the sawmill, but you \"won\", right?  I have never been so sad that I had \"succeeded\" at a game due to its gripping commentary of what is necessary to \"win\". The setting and depiction of this world is so immersive, with what is actually just a drop of backstory, to make you feel like you are in this alternate 19th century dystopian timeline. I enjoyed this work so much that I have put 18 hours into it over the course of 2 days, and thats with a fulltime job. Speaking of, it is now 3am and I have work in 5 hours. I just couldn't say no to saving my people, I am their leader, and I shall be till the last snowflake falls.",

They really let you dry in the sun in this topic.\n\nGood campaing, but horrible skirmish playing, since normal difficult is ridiculously easy (you max all resources so easy and fast, then nothing ever really breaks you in an endless game....) but then extreme difficult is something built for never achieving it (you get 50%, 60%, 70% of your population sick, ergo, useless so fast you never really have work force to build a city before the very first storm kills every single one of them).\n\nThey need to change how fast sick people get, or giving more engineers to treat them in extreme mode, because normal difficulty is too dull.\n\nWhat I've realized is this game carries a very, very, very and extremely narrow path for doing things, almost as a cake receipt. In changing the order among the ingredients, you ruin the cake.\n\nProblem is; it gets very, very dumb then, for it promises to be boring as hell. You get tired of the same cake taste.\n\nSo, this game is for people who doesn't like learning different ways to do things. You switch two buildings, fail. Switch two laws, fail. Switch the day and day time to build that particular and specific build, fail again.\n\nYou literaly HAVE TO sign or build at 5:00 in game.... that's too much demanding, that's just too dumb, because you kill the space for moving and enjoying. Think a RPG which you can only walk frontwards, never dodging, never jumping, never ducking, never hiting. Feels like a game for 5 y.o. to learn using a keyboard. \"Press 'N'. Congratulations. Go to next fase now\".\n\nMuch rather play age of empires, northgard, knights of honor, anno series, since developers made a very dumb strictly order list of doing things. Go play patience then, since you'll never be able to do something different.",

        "review": "Frostpunk is a great game, love the engaging challenge of the game that makes its grittiness a unique experience and its just challenging enough for it to feel fair and not just trauma-dumping. The world built around a very simple concept adds a ton of depth in each scenario, which in turn had me committing hours each time I booted up the game, and consistently losing track of time. As a base builder, Frostpunk carries itself pretty well within its genre as a game filled with unconventional conflicts, mitigated with thoughtful solutions.\r\n\r\n**The graphics** is beautiful enough to achieve a truly immersive journey and the pacing of the story adds a lot of character to each scenario. (4/5)\r\n**The gameplay** itself is very easy to pick up, making me feel adequately resourceful after a few hours of playing (4.8/5)\r\n**The UI **is quite simple to navigate and **the engine** very rarely has any issues or bugs for me (4.3/5). \r\n\r\nI've been wanting to play this game for the longest time but couldn't persuade myself to pay $30 plus DLCs. A game of that value I expect replayability and to be quite honest, although this game is very immersive, captivating and very easy to lose track of time playing, I do believe that it's only replayable if you're personally motivated to do better in the four available scenarios. I do hope that they release the DLCs for free upon the release of Frostpunk 2 and I am looking forward to the advances they make in their sequel.\r\n\r\nOverall score: 8.7/10",
