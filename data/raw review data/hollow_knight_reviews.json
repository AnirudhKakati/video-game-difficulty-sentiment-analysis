Everything about Hollow Knight is incredible-- the art, the gameplay mechanics, the music, the souls-like approach to storytelling. All of it works so insanely well together. I wish I could go back and experience this game for the first time again. An absolute must if you love 2D metroidvania platformers and a hauntingly beautiful setting.",

If you want to play it for fun, go for it. But if you feel: \"I want to see all the endings!\" -- fucking don't. It's not worth it. Godmaster is a huge pain in the ass, and it's not fun after having to practice these boss fights to perfection, and then having to run them all in a consistent gauntlet. You need to be a VERY specific type of person to enjoy Godmaster, and I'm not that type of person, and I tried to beat it for over 2 weeks, and now I low-key hate Hollow Knight for it.",

Firstly, I despise bosses that do nothing but spawn waves of minions at you and aren't otherwise very interesting to fight against. And this game has an alarming amount of them. It's just lazy design, period. (Flukemarm is probably one of the worst boss designs I've seen in a minute.) Secondly, I generally don't think it's a very good design choice at all to have the path between a boss and your last checkpoint be unnecessarily long and littered with a bunch of enemies you have to fight over and over again. It doesn't make the game more challenging or fun, it just makes it more frustrating and ultimately more boring. And the excuse of the path \"being part of the boss fight\" or whatever is completely ridiculous and so obviously a cop out for not putting in the effort of finding a better solution. I know this game takes a lot of inspiration from the Souls games, and this is definitely an element of soulslikes I think is just flat out bad game design. It's nothing more than the game wasting your time.\n\nBut other than these minor issues, the game is flawless, and better than 90% of AAA games out there.",

My first hour was spent just wandering around, trying to figure out where I need to go and not knowing where I even was... also because I though I'd be finding some upgrade first before fighting the first boss, so I tried not to go fight him, which was a mistake, as that is indeed the way to go.\n\nAfter you did that and find/get the mapupgrades however, it becomes an incredible experience. A hard one for sure, but very satsifying! it is a soulslike game after all!\n\nThe characters are great, the story is sad and gets you to try and find out more and more about it, as to why things ended up the way it did.\n\nThe movement and all the abilities and movement upgrades in this metroidvania, feel very responsive and nice to use. I enjoyed every bit of moving around in this game and this makes all the hard fights so fun to try over and over! If you lose, you know you lost because of yourself and don't blame the game for something that was out of your own hand. It's all up to you!\n\nThere are some cute caterpillars as collectibles that you can rescue. Just the soundeffekt they make when getting freed is so heartwarming, that you want to find them all!\n\nThe bosses themselves are all very unique and always feel great to learn. It really has some of my favorite fighting in 2d games.\n\nI really like looking back at this game again and again and if you aren't turned off by something that gets pretty hard sometimes, this will definitely please you!",

        "review": "Hollow Knight might be the highest rated metroidvania on Steam, and I'm saying that it's also the most overrated. Combat is simplistic, exploration is slow, and it punishes the player for using basic features like maps and map markers. But, none of that is why I can't recommend the game. Hollow Knight is just unforgivably inconvenient. Not difficult. Inconvenient.\n\nMy two primary rules for video games are respect my dollar and respect my time. Hollow Knight barely satisfies my first rule -- there are countless more engaging metroidvanias out there -- and absolutely stomps on my second rule. The leading examples of this are the slog of exploration (slow movement, sparse fast travel locations, obscene backtracking, poorly executed map,) and the baffling gap between save points and boss fights.\n\nBecause Hollow Knight snorted the souls-like powder, boss fights are tough. I like tough fights. What I don't like is my nearest save point being a five minute slog from the boss fight. There's a word for this kind of design: discouraging. No feature of any game, at any point, for any reason should ever be discouraging. If the player's feeling becomes \"I would have a better time if I stopped playing this game,\" the game has failed the player. Hollow Knight failed me.\n\n\n\n",

The organic way that Team Cherry connects every area in Hallownest is simply amazing. It allows the player to personalize the abilities of the knight with the big pool of charms. And lets not forget the history, although it is not told like in other games (given by different NPCs and lore plates in the environment), it is a deep and touching story with several endings. One of the best games that i have ever played",

Just try it, it has everything one could ask from a video game : immaculate art, creative game design, amazing soundtrack, phenomenal bosses, breathtaking world, sensational exploration. It's so good that I brought it at full price after pirating it, felt like I robbed the developers and couldn't silence my guilty conscience until I gifted it to few of my friends. With Silksong on the horizon, I think now is the best time to experience this masterpiece",

It's criminally under-priced, been out for years, and still stands as one of the best metroidvanias in the digital world. It's non-linear, with many different paths to take, and with so much to do. The story is amazing, the characters are amazing, the dialogue is amazing, the voice lines are amazing, both the mechanical and physical designs of this game are phenomenal. It's the perfect game for both skilled players and emotional players at the same time. If you're someone who enjoys game mechanics, prepare to frolic in the fields with controls that just feel incredibly right. If you're someone who gets attached to characters quickly and strongly, prepare to cry.\r\n\r\nIf you're reading these reviews, debating on whether or not to play this game, please. There's nothing to lose, and there's EVERYTHING to gain.*\r\n\r\n*this does not apply to people who get angry very easily at video games. this is a hard game for people who haven't played, don't expect it to be a cakewalk. earn your dopamine, buddy\r\n\r\nIf you're reading these reviews just to read them, hai helloo hai",

Even with my trash of a pc, this game runs almost perfectly. It can get hard to decide what to do next, especially without someone helping you out over call, text, or video, but It can be so fun just to explore this vast world. I've heard there's a TON of lore, and I've barely uncovered any. For as cheap as this game is, it is so worth picking up for a play! Even if you don't like this game, steam let's you refund games that you've played for less than two hours, so there is no reason not to get this game. I HIGHLY recommend this game.",

This could have worked but the distances between save points are too big meaning that you will most likely end up loosing everything your next try. Also, there are no checkpoints before bosses. You have to spend much time, each try, just getting to the boss over and over again, which is really tedious.",

        "review": "This game is very funny. I beat the boss at the far right of the game, but at the same time i died. When i went back there, she was nowhere to be found. It was like she evaporated, and it was hilarious. I really liked the twist ending where she tires to help me kill the final boss but fails and ends up dead. Something else funny is that there is a really easy skip that you can do to skip to a late game boss. all you have to do is go where the game expects you to use wall jumps to go over a wall, but instead of having wall jump you can just ascend by going right next to the spikes and repeatinglly swinging down. For some reason, the game developers didn't think to account for how hitting something with a downswing knocks you upwards and you can use it to skip stuff. One complaint is that the journal requires like 25 mosskins, but there are only like 7 in the entire game, so if you want to complete the journal you should probably kill a mosskin whenever you see one instead of just avoiding them. Another funny part is when you are in the coloseum and it spawns two throwing guys, but then a spike floor comes in and kills them. I don't understand how you can play as that one lady in Silksong if she dies at the end of the game. Maybe there is an alternate ending where she lives. Something else funny is that the game spends a bunch of time working up to a \"void heart\" item, but it does nothing. I guess it is just meant as a challenge, like that secret part in the Dream Palace where you have to downswing on the spikes that go up and down to reach a miniboss which is actually just two minibosses. It was difficult, but it wasn't too hard for me since i am pretty good at bouncing off of things by downswinging (which is my favourite way to kill enemies).\n\nUpdate: I found some alternate endings. One is where that lady never shows up to the final battle, possibly because i didn't refight her at the edge of the map, or maybe because i didn't do something else. The other ending i found is when you hit the final boss with the Dreamnail after she jumps on it.",

The fast traveling system requires going to the fast travel points and they are so few and far between that they rarely make a difference between going to the fast travel point to travel and just hoofing it the whole way there.\n\nAlso, the ost is kind of bland leading to the game experience feeling a bit dull. Not sure if I ever really cared to make the difference between the region's music as its all kind of the same \"dark, gloomy, and sad\" aesthetic.",

And the gameplay is just as good if not better than the lore. The platforming is satisfyingly smooth and the combat is intuitive allowing a low skill floor and an endlessly high skill ceiling. There are countless challenges in the game in the form of increasingly difficult bosses and even the boss-rush event in the Pantheons. All in all, Hollow Knight is 100% worth it to purchase and play.",

Every death is a mistake to learn from. Nothing is handed to you and everything is earned through persistence and becoming a better fighter and platformer.\n\nMasterfully composed soundtrack that keeps you going in every single fight. Good metroidvania aspects with fun power progression/scaling.\nEach environment is pretty and crafted to be its own within the world of Hallownest.\n\nSome of the most memorable and best boss fights I've ever had (minus that one mf moth) that really showcases the fast and fluid movement/fighting mechanics -- be bold and jiggy with it!\n\nEDIT: Adds a nice touch to the souls-genre by making you fight your own death shade to get your money back. Compared this with the same mechanic in Nine Sols and I appreciate it more.",

Terrible checkpoint system forcing you to walk through trivial areas \"as punishment for dying\", which is a fancy way of artificially inflating game time. Combine that with the terrible map system, the loss of resources and insanely boring back tracking, you just get a frustrating experience.\r\nThe fast travel system is a joke, once again forcing the player to run around areas that do not matter anymore.\r\nThe few boss fights I had so far were very easy, but I'd assume these pick up over time, but I will not waste several minutes walking back to more difficult fights over and over again.\r\nThe music was by far the highlight of the game for me.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Dark Souls masochist that thinks not being able to play the game is a good punishment system, go on ahead, otherwise there are plenty of better alternatives.",

The indirect and direct storytelling is incredible and its fun discovering it yourself. Gameplay is super fun and graphics hold up super well even after quite some time. One of my favorite things about Hollow Knight is that mod support is not limited, so youre able to play Multiplayer, etc. using mods. \r\nHolds a very special place in my heart. Loved this game and its atmosphere.",

The story is intriguing and at times actually plays into the gameplay, and there is a wealth of extra side-tasks to complete to further fill out the world and the experience. Overall, an easy 10/10. An easy game to suggest to anyone interested.",

        "review": "Very excellent game! Firstly, the hand drawn style of the graphics has been well polished to adapt to the electronic form of art in gaming; Secondly, the game has rich content that can bring many different adventure experiences, so there is no need to worry about excessive repetition; Thirdly, the game's design is interlocking and linear, allowing each part of the map to be played once and explored again later; Fourthly, the game difficulty is reasonable, with a good balance of difficulty distribution, and players with different levels of skills can have their own performances. Overall, it is very suitable for purchasing and playing!\r\nSome other points: Some people think there is a problem with the map movement of the Hollow Knight, but I think this has different answers for everyone. Not everyone likes to place the teleportation point at the boss's doorstep or at a distance of ten million miles. It can only be said that the production team has made the necessary balance in it. Some people think that the guidance of the game is too poor, which cannot be denied. This game has almost no guidance, but requires you to do many hidden tasks to advance. I think instead of setting too many guides in the map, perhaps the storyline can be used to secretly guide the player's route through storytelling. Currently, the plot of Hollow Knight can only be understood through design books or the internet, which can be improved.\r\nMy English is not very good, I hope you guys can understand me. Looking forward to the SilkSong!",

The bosses in this game are hard, your reflexes in real life are probably going to improve upon completing this game.\n\nOnly 1/5th of people played this game to full completion and beat The Hollow knight, so be ready for a challenge. Something else I found odd, for some reason fans of this game across the internet think that the characters in this game don't have genders? Don't listen to them nor the wiki (wiki's aren't maintained by devs), the knight you play as is male same for the Hollow Knight. Some people claim the game to be woke but it really doesn't come across like that to me. \n\nI think the game is great, and I wish anyone who buys this game a lot of luck!",

        "review": "Hands down, this is my favourite game of all time. When I started, I thought it would be a game I maybe beat once, then forget about it. But, oh boy, was I wrong. You start by exploring the starting area, then progressing towards the first boss. Team Cherry did a great job by making the start of the game not to overwhelming. Then, you find a few more regions, beat a few more bosses and collect a couple of charms and abilities. Then, before you know it you’re at the final boss. And you might think that after that, you’re done with the game, however, that is not that case. You can discover new endings, beat some more bosses and beat an entire pantheon.\n\nThe boss fights, the map and the combat mechanics are absolutely outstanding. Even though this was my first true “souls-like,” even though I spent hours on some bosses, this was the best experience I’ve ever had with ANY video game. You can unlock charms, use unique abilities and much more. The developers truly went over the top creating this game, and for that I’m very grateful. Not only that, but this game is criminally underpriced. $21 (aud) for a 60 hour story, INCLUDING free dlc. And I would be doing this game shame if I didn’t mention the soundtrack. The music fits the theme so well, it is relaxing at times, and exhilarating at other times. Every part of this game is unique and absolutely flawless. I would recommend this game to anyone, even if it was there first soulslike. Just please, get this game, you won’t regret it. It’s an absolutely phenomenal game, props to the developers. This game is truly a gem. Can’t wait until silksong.\n\n(pls remove path of pain its painful asf)",

I died several times, and isn't possible to pass across an area without defeating again and again all the monsters, EVERY TIME you do that path. That doesn't make any sense and don't make the game more hard itself, but makes him more annoing to play. I'm sayng that afer all, If you can't chosse the game difficult, when to save, If u die 2 times you loose all and the difficoult to move, at least don't make the moster spawn when I have already defeated too many times",

        "review": "Hollow Knight and I have an interesting history. I started off feeling very \"meh\" about it. The boss fights were incredibly long without a health bar to know how close I was getting, several bosses were difficult because of ads or environmental hazards rather than the actual boss being hard, and so many bosses were were optional that I missed a vast amount of content in my first playthrough. \n\nI \"beat\" the game on my first playthrough and thought that was pretty much it, put the game down and moved on to the next thing. It wasn't until at least a year later that I watched a random youtube playthrough of Hollow Knight that I realized I didn't just miss one or two bosses, but I missed entire regions, abilities, and amazing charms. I am also someone who is normally quite thorough in exploration. I decided to get back into the game and I played Hollow Knight the way it was actually intended. \n\nHaving the basics down, I experimented with spells, charms combinations, and different strategies. The experience was night and day. Boss fights became much faster, and were no longer tedious now that I was doing consistent damage at close and long range. \n\nI explored every inch of the map (looking for Silk Song), found every boss, and took on the Pantheon. Even as a souls veteran who is used to challenge, the Pantheon was the hardest challenge I've faced yet taking me over 8 hours to finish P5 alone. If you stick to it, it is also extremely rewarding once you've climbed that mountain.\n\nHollow Knight is one of those rare gems that depends on what you put into it. If you only explore the surface level, you'll have a nice experience that likely won't be anything special. The caves are vast and you'll enjoy the sense of exploration and being lost. However, if you invest time to explore, master mechanics, and take on all of its challenges, you will quickly find Hollow Knight rising to the top of your list of favorite games. \n\nit will also make you sad that Silk Song isn't out yet.",

Even the Pantheons in this game are fun. Spell Builds are ABSOLUTELY BUSTED. NKG IS THE BEST BOSS IN THIS WHOLE GAME. Speedrunning the game is surprisingly fun and easy, thanks to Fireb0rn's Speedrun guide, and you'll find yourself at the end of the game in no time at all. 112%ing this game is worth every hour spent.",

I've recently been trying to add this game to my perfect games collection, and while some things are grindy, they are optional. If you are looking for a calmer, relaxed experience, you can have that, even though this is a moderately hard game. If you're like me however, you can do more of the harder stuff, and this game proves again and again to be a challenge.\r\n\r\nOverall, Hollow Knight is a fantastic game, and I'd recommend it. 9/10, point docked because; Silksong when?",

Its almost like fnaf in the way that the lore you need to use your big head to figure out which I personally dont like but it could be good for people who want to be satisfied after finally figuring out the lore. My second and final flaw is that it is too easy to get lost and not know how to progress in the game, which makes it an “explore for ages and hope you find something that progresses the story”. Otherwise the game id perfect, the map is beautiful, I love the art style, its the perfect difficulty, you can play the game in so many ways, there are so many things to do and finally the game has better endgame content then pokemon does, which is extremely difficult to pull off. 9/10 definitely worth the $15",

        "review": "The video game community at large has no shortage of indie darlings, but one would be hard-pressed to find one as widely praised as Team Cherry's beautiful metroidvania: Hollow Knight. It doesn't take much time playing the game to understand exactly why it's so beloved - the lovely hand-drawn sprites and backgrounds pair with Christopher Larkin's breathtaking score to produce an atmosphere that, on its own, could easily carry a game half as good as this one to fame and acclaim. Thankfully, the game is excellent even beyond its audiovisual merit. Taking heavy inspiration from Castlevania and Dark Souls alike, Hollow Knight's map winds ever in on itself, seeming to grow more and more dense with each skill you unlock. Combat, meanwhile, is rhythmic and satisfying. The simplicity of the moves available to the player requires encounters with unique enemies to carry the longevity of the experience, and between bosses and regular enemies, the quota for variety is met and exceeded. If there was one thing the game truly excels at, however, it would movement. The player's control over the Knight is honed to a fine perfection, making the positioning, spacing, and dodge-heavy fights feel like an elegant dance - as most great action games should strive for. With one playthrough under my belt clocking in at just over twenty hours, I still feel as though there is much left to see and discover in Hollow Knight, and I'm already looking forward to my next foray into Hallownest. 9/10.",

The music and ambiance do a great job empowering the atmosphere, and overall somber feel. There are a lot of characters that make the world feel alive and inhabited, the cute and somewhat simplistic art style helps their personalities shine. The gameplay is a solid mix of action and platforming, the charm systems allow for different builds so the player can choose the way of playing that suits their taste. The difficulty is rather moderate with some difficult optional challenges.",

        "review": "Hollow Knight is the gold standard of side-scrolling metroidvanias, and for good reason. Simple yet deep combat, incredible atmosphere, excellent level design, strong sense of mystery encouraging exploration, and terrific soundtrack.\n\nIf someone likes those things (I imagine most people do) then this game is highly recommended. The only caveat I would put on it is the willingness to frustrate the player in a way not shared by many modern titles (for better or for worse). There are two main principles that demonstrate this that inform how the player plays the game for the entirety of the duration. \n\nThe first is the respawn mechanic which happens at benches (save points) rather than being able to manually save at any time. This is not a huge problem for the most part when benches are placed directly outside major boss encounters, but there do exist instances in the game where the bench is perhaps needlessly far from the associated boss encounter with several enemies and hazards along the journey back, leading to frustration.\n\nThe second is the lack of a fast travel mechanic outside of the stag stations are particular points in the world, necessitating the player to physically arrive at these locations just to travel to an array of prescribed locations that may or may not be anywhere close to where the player wants to go. This can lead to a lot of what can be considered unnecessary journeying that pads game time.\n\nHowever, it must be said that many consider these features of Hollow Knight as opposed to disadvantages. They are very obviously intentional design decisions, and it must be respected that Team Cherry decided to go with them to fit their vision of the game despite knowing they would frustrate some. It could just as easily be argued that the placement of benches away from certain bosses emphasis the importance of learning the attack patterns and weaknesses quickly. It could also just as easily be argued that the lack of an instant fast travel (e.g. in something like Breath of the Wild, or even in a game more comparable to this like Ori and the Will of the Wisps) necessitates familiarly and learning the routes of the (very beautiful) world to get places as quickly as possible. It should also be noted that these things are certainly not unique to Hollow Knight and do appear in many other very beloved games, so one can't truly single this game out if they disagree with these design choices.\n\nI believe the \"for\" and the \"against\" arguments are both valid at the same time, and whichever one someone agrees with more entirely depends on the person. This is even more reason as to why these things need to be pointed out.\n\nOverall, Hollow Knight is a terrific game that's easy to run and also great on handheld consoles (steam deck, ROG ally, etc).",

Every time I set the game down, I'm pulled back in, powerless to resist. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Will I ever know peace? Not until I defeat her.",

I kind of rushed through it just to get it over it since like I said it wasn't my cup of tea but I still enjoyed majority of it.

Only downside I can think of is some very hard specific platforming sections. These are very frustrating and you don't do platforming that much in the first place there weren't any need of them in my opinion.\n\nBuy this game for yourself and for your friends. It will be one of your best spending.",

I get backtracking is important in metroidvanias , but it has been done so much better since . Today games that have maps as big as hollownest ( like prince of persia lost crown ) don't have the issue of backtracking feeling repetitive . \r\n\r\nOverall , this game had a huge influence and is a classic , but sometimes classic don't age perfectly for everyone . 7/10 and still a must try , but there is nothing wrong for not enjoying it .",

I had only heard excellent things about this game, and they were right. This game is a masterpiece and a must-play. It's difficult, yes, but where your skill starts and where it ends is night and day.\n\nPantheon 5, for example. If you know, you know. I had made it my goal to complete it, but at the time it was a pipe dream. Now, I've completed every single achievement in the game. Before, the first bosses were a struggle, and now I'm doing it deathless. This game is satisfying. The combat, music, world-building, artwork, all top-class. Do yourself a favor and play Hollow Knight.",

It becomes more and more unforgiving as you progress through the story. This game is designed to kick your ass in every possible way, and I hate it. I hate that I’ve already sunk almost 40 hours into it, and there’s no end in sight. Every new location is much, much harder, and not in a fun way. Later areas remind me of those 'hardest game in the world' types, where you have to avoid constant obstacles. And then there’s the geo grind, which you can lose very easily. Even when you think everything’s under control and your geo is safe, the game throws nasty surprises at you—just to annoy you.\n\nDon't, I repeat, DON'T buy this game if you're a casual player. This game is like your ex—it makes you fall in love at first with its beautiful visuals, music, and manageable early bosses, but then it just screws you over. You get trapped in a sunk cost fallacy—you’ve already invested so many hours that you feel compelled to beat it, but it’s unbelievably hard, and it just makes you angry. I don’t enjoy games that make me angry, games should be fun. If you’re looking for fun, play something else. This isn’t fun—it’s a grueling difficulty grind. If you have real challenges in life (like a job, kids), focus on those. This game isn’t worth it.",

        "review": "while I enjoyed the game, it came with a ton of flaws that mods have already partially fixed. the biggest issue lies in traversing the map; this game has terrible flow. compared to other search action games like metroid dread or blasphemous, I was never asking where do I go next, I had a general idea or adam just told me (although they put the way forward right in front of you most of the time after you grab a new powerup in metroid anyways). in hollow knight: no. it's really cool for a while just kinda wandering and filling out the map, but after like 8 hours eventually you run out of places to wander to and you will hit some kind of dead end.\n\nwhen you hit this dead end, you're like great, do I really have to walk back all the way and yeah, you do. sometimes you might find a train station, but if the place you want to go to is not near a train station (usually always this is the case), then get ready to backtrack a lot. once the game starts passing normal game length of about 8-10 hours, the rest starts to just get to fatigue you. I spent most of the rest of my 10 hours just going back over each part of the map like 3 times before I finally find a powerup, then I have to go to every door that leads to blank space on the map to check if my ability I just got solves why I couldnt go there earlier, of course mostly by walking all the way back there, and it it just compounds and compounds and just gets so tedious.\n\npart of this gets solved if you add a teleport to any rest spot mod, but also you can't fix the level design. the levels themselves are fine, there's just no flow. you get a new ability in one odd end of the map, then you have to use it to get out of the room you just got it in, but nothing nearby requires that ability; the nearest place to use it is on an opposite end of the map. if you're on the bottom and get the double jump, you need it on the far east end of the map or the very top. if you get the super dash on the east end, you need it on the west end, like ??? maybe if they included like a town portal scroll type deal, you could at least use the train from dirtmouth to try to mitigate things a bit, but nah, you're stuck. you can unlock an ability to place a teleport at a location of your choosing, but I unlocked it 16 hours into my playthrough where it was nearly beyond its usefulness since most of the map was unlocked already).\n\nit's weird, it feels like they're trying to pad the length almost even though, nah, they dont need to. the other complaint is that the final boss is way more difficult than any other non-optional fight in the game (with ghost refights being the only things near the same level I found, the soul guy and ghost knight guy). then if you also fight radiance, they decided every hit does 2 damage for some reason and if you die, you have to beat the other final boss over to get another shot at it? why? it just wastes my time and made it take like twice as long to figure out the fight (I was playing really aggressive because I wanted it to end sooner, until I learned you gotta play defensive against it, so ugh). they made radiance a \"dont fruck up\" fight, where if you make a mistake, it's compounded against you real hard since there's not much heal time. you can get away with like 1, maybe 2 if you're lucky, and each hit does 2 damage, so bleh. so all that and you have to get good at the previous guy, lame.\n\ntldr: game wastes your time a lot, consider using teleport mods for when you get lost to keep you from wandering. final bosses lame.",

        "review": "Oh boy, am I gonna get crap for this...\r\n\r\nI bought this game with its reputation of being one of those \"instant-classic\" games that every gamer should play, but about ten hours in, I wasn't having fun, and things just got more miserable the more I played. (I finished it because I'm stubborn)\r\n\r\nGraphics & sound: \r\nThe game is well animated and the sounds, music, and even lighting are on point. The ambiance and atmosphere is by far this game's strongest point. \r\n\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is kind of a \"speculating wildly on the internet over crumbs\" situation. With exception of the environment itself, there's not much story which is actually told to the player, only a few scraps of information from various characters, and a lot of \"use your imagination\" to go around. By the end of the game, I still hadn't pieced together more than \"The kingdom is in ruin, most citizens who aren't dead are insane & kill-crazy, and everything sucks.\" I got the distinct impression that I wasn't a hero trying to save what was left of the world, but some random murder hobo who wandered in to finish it off. This lack of any distinct goal just left only \"clear the map and find new things\" as the only reason to keep going, which was not very fun. And then all the annoyances which I would have swept under the rug if I were more invested, just kept stacking up. \r\n\r\nCombat:\r\nOverall, combat is pretty good, and just the right level of challenge for [i]most[/i] of the game.  The player character is oddly capable of most combat right out of the starting gate. The only real upgrades you get (besides damage number go up) is a weak projectile spell, a worthless vertical-attack spell (which isn't much better than your normal upward swing), and a downwards charge, which is rarely useful in combat, and I really only used it for opening up areas. Well, you also get longer ranged melee swings that you have to charge up, but honestly you're far better off just using normal attacks 99% of the time, since it's easier, and you’re not stuck with cool-down frames. So yeah, get used to the attacks you have at the beginning, as you're gonna be using precious little else for the rest of the game. \r\n\r\nNavigation:\r\nThe root of so many frustrations I had with this game all keep coming back to revolve around the map. You can only use the map if you bought one for the area that you're in. You can only get a map if you randomly stumble upon the one room in the area that has the map merchant. You can only record down the layouts of rooms after you search every corner of the room, then go back and sit on a bench (which might be around the corner, or another ten rooms away). So often you're just going to be bumbling around blindly, missing secrets left and right, then have to backtrack over every inch of ground later on when you get the map, then AGAIN when you get another access ability, then AGAIN when you get the next one, and then AGAIN when you look up a guide to find out you still missed like five things in that one room because you didn't try hitting every single wall to see if it broke, and there's an entire level hidden behind there (looking at you, Bee-Hive). Also, can we just admit how BS it is that you need to use one of your notches to equip item that tells you where you are on the map? It's like needing to equip a piece of armor just to pause the game. You'd have to be a lunatic think this was a good idea.\r\n\r\nThere were so many areas that I missed because I couldn't pull up my map and put a marker \"come back for this later when I get another ability\" on that area, I didn't find the guy who upgraded your sword until I had cleared over two thirds of the map. I didn't find the lady who sold you charm notches until I had enough progress to just buy out her entire stock in one visit. I didn't get the poison resistance ability until I was done exploring 95% of every area that had poison pools. There is no clear direction, and you can easily go through and clear areas way harder than what they are supposed to be because you decided to take on the Colosseum of Fools with only a Mothwing cloak, Mantis hook, and your starting blade because you didn't realize you were supposed to go elsewhere first, and you bang your head into the difficulty wall for THREE WEEKS STRAIGHT because \"this is a souls-like and it's supposed to be hard, right?\" Don't even get me started on the Spirit's Glade: just look up a guide before you walk in, and thank me later.\r\n\r\nConclusion: \r\nThis is an \"internet\" game. You watch your favorite streamer play this a lot, watch ten essays breaking down what the plot is about, then you decide to try it out for yourself after you already have a good idea of where most things are, what you want to take from the story, and a guide to collect all the things. Overall, I give it a 3 out of 5, (a bit too charitable), but I can't give it a positive recommendation.",

Her Light seeped out and appeared in bug's dreams because the vessel wasn't actually devoid of mind nor will because it bonded with the Pale King, which is proven by the memory you see in the White Palace, and now everyone has turned into mindless zombies which caused Hallownest to fall into ruin all those years ago??

        "review": "The Masterpiece of Hollow Knight: A Deep Dive into Its Artistic Brilliance and Gameplay\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the realm of indie video games, few titles have garnered as much acclaim as Team Cherry's Hollow Knight. Released in 2017, this action-adventure Metroidvania has captivated players with its hauntingly beautiful world, intricate design, and profound storytelling. Its seamless blend of artistic vision, gameplay mechanics, and emotional depth establishes Hollow Knight not only as a standout title of its time but as a modern masterpiece in the gaming landscape.\n\nArtistic Vision and Atmosphere\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Hollow Knight is its hand-drawn art style, which creates a visually stunning and immersive experience. The game's world, Hallownest, is rich in detail and diversity, featuring beautifully rendered environments ranging from the eerie Forgotten Crossroads to the lush Greenpath and the desolate City of Tears. This artistic choice not only captures the imagination but also complements the game's themes of decay, beauty, and resilience.\n\nThe atmosphere is further enhanced by the haunting soundtrack composed by Christopher Larkin. Each area of Hallownest features unique melodies that evoke a range of emotions, from nostalgia to melancholy. The music weaves seamlessly into the gameplay, enriching the player's journey and reinforcing the sense of isolation and exploration.\n\nGameplay and Design\n\nAt its core, Hollow Knight excels in gameplay mechanics that reward exploration and mastery. The game's map is expansive and intricately designed, encouraging players to revisit areas with newfound abilities. This Metroidvania structure not only fosters a sense of progression but also deepens player engagement, as every corner of Hallownest is filled with secrets, lore, and challenges.\n\nCombat in Hollow Knight is fluid and precise, striking a balance between accessibility and depth. The player controls the titular knight with agility, utilizing a mix of melee attacks and magical abilities. The game's bosses are particularly noteworthy; each encounter is a test of skill and strategy, featuring unique designs and attack patterns that challenge players to adapt and learn.\n\nStorytelling and Themes\n\nUnlike many games that rely on overt exposition, Hollow Knight tells its story through environmental storytelling, item descriptions, and interactions with NPCs. The lore of Hallownest is rich and layered, inviting players to piece together the narrative through exploration and curiosity. Themes of loss, sacrifice, and the cyclical nature of life and death resonate throughout the game, making each encounter with its inhabitants—both friend and foe—feel significant.\n\nThe game also explores the concept of identity through the protagonist’s journey. As players delve deeper into Hallownest, they uncover the knight's past and the tragic history of the kingdom, prompting reflections on duty, legacy, and the consequences of choices.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a gaming industry often dominated by flashy graphics and linear storytelling, Hollow Knight stands out as a masterclass in artistry, gameplay, and narrative depth. Its ability to create an immersive world that invites exploration and emotional investment is a testament to Team Cherry's vision and craftsmanship. The game’s legacy continues to influence developers and inspire players, solidifying its place as a modern classic. Hollow Knight is not just a game; it is an experience that lingers long after the screen fades to black, making it a true masterpiece of the medium.\n\nand also Zote",

The atmosphere, the gameplay, the music; it's all great. This game is a work of art and I truly think its the best in the genre. The worst thing about it is now I also have to wait for Silksong :(",

It was extremely challenging for me as a person who isn't very good at video games especially platforming but I loved it so much despite my lack of skill because it's so beautiful and rewarding. It took me ages to get where I am and I'm still not 100% but it's absolutely worth it. If you're good at metroidvanias then you'll have a different experience but for those of you who consider yourselves \"bad at games\", I really recommend you keep trying with this one.",

The story and world-building are incredible, the soundtrack is a top 3 all-timer, the art, the gameplay, the challenge, the replayability... the *mood*. It's the Half-Life of 2D games and you have to play it. Good luck.",

        "review": "Hollow Knight, what to say, it's one hell of a great game. The way that it both makes you lose at the start of the game yet still willing to uncover every tiny place of the map is amazing. I gotta tell you, I haven't been sure whether I actually want to purchase this game, yet listened to people telling how great the game is and how glad I am I did. \r\n\r\nFor the starters, although at first it kinda looks like NPCs in this game don't really have that much interesting to say, I'm greatly surprised by how deep and interesting the lore of this Indie game is. I could listen someone talk about this game for hours and still I feel like there is thing I still don't know about lore of it. \r\n\r\nBosses, well some may say that they don't look that challanging and that the pattern is so clear to say. Well easier to say while watching and while playing, throught my first playthrough i died what felt like hundreds of times to bosses (might be skill issue). As some bosses seem to be more rewarding or challanging it's still extremely fun to fight with every one of them, even the less rewarding ones.\r\n\r\nI personally think that if you want to really enjoy this game, at least 100% it, and later check after your expierience whether you want to continue your journey on getting 112%. To give up on Hollow Knight after first 3 locations is quite literally missing out on finding diamonds. There is so much content into the game that it's just foolish to give up after unlocking like 3 major abilities. This game has it's reasons to be so well respected, known and enjoyed throught whole world. And I can for sure say that one of main one is the fact of it's map which is both beautiful and big to not keep player bored.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be shame to not talk about the soundtrack/sound background of this game. Literally wherever you go you either hear fitting perfectly ambient sounds to the locations or on contrary as you make yourself through quite literal Abyss, there is not that much sounds you hear. And not to mention the music that companions you and builds you up while fighting the bosses. Just pure masterpiece. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend to anyone to try this game, controls might at first be a bit hard if you're not used to such set of keys but of course you can change them to the way that it's more comfortable for you to fight throught this majestic and at times slightly horrifying world.",

I've never played a game like this before, so it's my first time, and I'd say it's pretty easy if you pay attention to movements and get a rotation going with enemies in the game. It is a beautiful game, and it has such interesting NPC's as well as lore; somewhat confusing for me, but I'm following along as much as I can. Overall, it is 10/10, and I'm definitely taking my time with it to really take it in and get better at it too, so maybe I can speed run it one day.",

In my opinion, Hollow Knight is THE definition of a Metroidvania (obviously excluding Metroid or Castlevania).\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is phenomenal, smooth, and extremely fun to master in terms of both movement abilities and combat. The OST and visuals are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen in gaming, to the point where this is pretty much the only OST I casually listen to. The lore is actually extremely complex if you decide to delve deeper into it, but most of it is entirely optional and extremely fun to seek out.\r\n\r\nThe thing I love about Hollow Knight this most though, is the community. It's one of the most wholesome, wonderful communities I've ever seen on the internet, and I'm proud to be a part of it. :)\r\n",

The combat is challenging, but you can feel yourself improving consistently. The lore is there, but you have to dig for it, and it doesn't force you into annoying cut scenes or make you follow a direct path. This means you can focus on whatever you want during and after you play, be it fighting mobs or bosses, collecting the various trinkets around the map, or immersing yourself in the fascinating lore. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys challenging combat, and wants to be whisked away to a dark, yet charming world.",

        "review": "\nVerily, this be the finest game ever conceived by the hand of man, a marvel unmatched in all the vast and boundless realms of creation. In its very essence, there lieth a rare and wondrous delight, as though the heavens themselves had bestowed their favor upon its making. Each element, from the smallest whisper of sound to the grandest sweep of its world, doth speak of a craft so fine, so peerless, that it seemeth almost a divine gift. No mortal work of hand or mind can so lay claim to such mastery, for in its intricate design, its rich and beauteous tapestry, and the depths of its mysteries, doth it far surpass all that hath come before or may ever come again.\n\nWithin its boundless halls, one doth wander as though upon the very edge of dreams, where every shadow holds secrets and every step doth stir the heart. Its challenges, though fierce and unyielding, doth quicken the spirit, and in every victory, there is a joy that few other ventures can bestow. The player, like a valiant knight of old, must prove their mettle through wit and skill, and in this proving, they doth find not only entertainment but a reflection of the self—a journey as much of the soul as of the mind.\n\nTruly, this game doth transcend the mere bounds of amusement, for it is a thing of beauty, of art most sublime, where every corner, every moment, doth sing of the highest ideals of creation. The tales it tells, the challenges it offers, and the world it weaves doth elevate it far beyond the realm of common diversion. It stirreth the heart with a passion unbridled, enchanteth the mind with endless wonder, and transporteth the soul to heights unimagined. Lo, no other game, be it from ancient times or those yet to come, may boast such grace, grandeur, and perfection. In this creation, one doth find the spirit of the ages, a timeless masterpiece that shall stand for all eternity as the pinnacle of human imagination and endeavor.",

Gave it a try, and it was not fun, I was confused, frustrated and overall not having a good time. I tried over and over agian to try and get into the game, yet nothing worked. For over 2 years, i did not think this game was worth the hype. \n\nIn 2023 I finally beat elden ring and earlier in 2024 i had completed the DLC as well. It was my first taste of a souls like and i really loved it. That finally inspired me to give this game one last shot. I loaded up a save, blasted thru the first couple of sections, and finally got into it. (mind you with a full map of the game bc i can't stand being lost) and I had a great time. Hollow knight is one of the few perfect games. Even if i wasn't a fan of the backtracking I can fully understand that is just personal preference and doesn't affect my view on the game. Please, if you are just sitting on this game, do your best to try it once more, get thru the first two sections (should take about 2 hours) and see how you feel. I promise that it is fully worth it.",

The speed and complexity of the boss fights gradually ramp up, constantly providing new challenges to overcome. Some of the late game dlc bosses are difficult but fair. Managing to adapt and overcome these fast paced encounters is very satisfying.",

With a vast world full of different characters, environments, gameplay mechanics. And it's so, so fun to play. The hardest part for me was how this game plays with your trust. I wasn't used to that darkness in games. And yet I learned so much from it. Very grateful to have played so much of this, and hoping to one day re-visit it to get more achievements.",

        "review": "It is difficult to find where to start to talk about this game. There are so many good things to want to bring forward.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there is the storytelling, which is done both via the vibrant world and the characters you meet. Conversation is minimal, but there is a very clear idea what is going on with the areas you traverse. \r\n\r\nThen, there is the metroid-esque ability to choose some parts of where you go next, which means that you can often go multiple ways and continue elsewhere if you get stuck. Fortunately, there is a duo of fast travel systems to encourage that. \r\n\r\nNext, there is the combat, which is difficult but fair, and there is only one single boss that makes me rip my hair out, even though I have died dozens of times to some others. (DAMN YOU ZOTE). \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, and no parts of it intrude too much upon your gameplay. The game has something to continually entice you to keep playing, and I have 106%-ed it so far, making me a few percent of from full completion (the free DLC causes the rise above 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you like 2d platformers and metroid-like exploration, this game is highly recommended.",

Also everyone has a different experience with this game because there is just so much to explore and find no playthrough is the same for two individual people, (except maybe speedrunners but that's not really a first playthough). It's an incredible challenging game that keeps me coming back to it even after playing so much on my Switch.",

        "review": "Holy crap this game is incredible. The way I found it was from a 2 minute segment of a video about a totally different game, but even from what I saw and heard, I was completely hooked. And I can certainly say that Hollow Knight more than lived up to my expectations. From its beautiful artstyle, fluid movement and controls, complex and satisfying combat, expansive world,  rich lore, and deep characters, this game has SO SO much to offer. And not to mention that the game is ONLY $15 which is such a steal it's insane. There are a couple things that I don't like about this game, like that the Dream Warriors are a little bit annoying to fight, but it's such a small percent of the game that I don't like (and it isn't even required) that it can essentially be overlooked entirely. TLDR; This game is incredible, and you should 1000% play it. Absolutely worth the time and cost.",

        "review": "Hollow Knight is an indie gem that stands out as one of the finest examples of the Metroidvania genre. Developed by Team Cherry, this hand-drawn action-adventure game offers a stunning world filled with intricately designed environments, deep lore, and tight, responsive gameplay.\n\nSet in the ruined kingdom of Hallownest, you play as a small, silent warrior exploring caverns, ancient cities, and much more while battling a variety of enemies and bosses. The game’s visual style is simple yet striking, with its hauntingly beautiful art evoking a sense of melancholy and mystery. The attention to detail in the environments is exceptional, creating an atmosphere that feels both grand and intimate at the same time.\n\nGameplay is where Hollow Knight truly shines. Its combat is deceptively simple, but as you progress, the game introduces a wide array of abilities, upgrades, and spells that add layers of strategy. The map system, exploration, and platforming mechanics are well-balanced, making every discovery feel rewarding and every challenge earned. The game’s difficulty can be punishing but fair, appealing to players who enjoy a challenge without feeling overly frustrating.\n\nThe soundtrack is another highlight, perfectly capturing the somber yet epic mood of the game. The score adds depth to the already immersive world, enhancing emotional moments and boss battles with its evocative melodies.\n\nOne of Hollow Knight’s strengths is its non-linear exploration. It doesn’t hold your hand, encouraging you to discover secrets and make connections between different areas on your own. This design can sometimes make the game feel overwhelming, especially since there are very few explicit directions, but for players who enjoy figuring things out, this adds to the experience.\n\nIn terms of value, Hollow Knight is impressive. Despite being an indie game, it offers dozens of hours of content with its sprawling world, secrets, multiple endings, and post-launch DLCs, all of which are free.\n\nIn summary, Hollow Knight is a masterclass in design and atmosphere, offering a richly rewarding experience for players who love exploration, challenge, and deep, immersive worlds. Its blend of precise gameplay, artistic beauty, and haunting music makes it one of the best indie games in recent years.",

What should be praised is how you play the game and as the story develops, it helps you play without making the game too difficult or easy. The combat is also a gem as some games go for style in boss fights (Final Fantasy) or intensity (Dark Souls) this game makes the boss fights both stylish and intense.\n\n   In the context of Story, we see how the world in which it is set entire history and how it went from greatness to ruin unlike some games that tell you everything (elder scrolls) or are overtly vague (Elden Ring) which reduces the impact it has this game understands how to make a balance that allows you to understand the world. Finally this game somehow never loses its ability to be repayable which in many games and even after you complete the games I guarantee it doesn't lose its edge. In Conclusion, play it now!!!",

There is so much to do, so many bosses to fight, so many collectibles to find, so many upgrades to get, and so many side quests all in one game that costs fifteen bucks. There is so much to play, that most of the hours that I have sunk into this game, are on one save, (most likely around forty-five hours), so I think that might prove how much this game has to offer. So if your on the fence on buying this amazing game and happen to see this, this is your sign to buy it.",

All of the exploration and gathering of upgrade material is incredibly satisfying.",

Nope. Nah. Not doing it. Tried it for a while and just noped the hell outta there. Grimm was a freaking walk in the park compared to that clusterfuck of despair.\r\nI truly love Hollow Knight and can't wait for Silksong to drop - but fuck Godhome. You filthy elitist time-sink...\r\n\r\nAnyway, play the game. It's amazing. Just don't expect it to be kind with your feelings in the end-game stuff.\r\nAnd be ready to accept that maybe some parts of it were just not meant for you. Which is fine.\r\nThanks for an amazing experience, Team Cherry!",

I could wax poetic on and on about every aspect of this game, every little detail; but my words would still fall short in describing this absolute masterpiece. it is an easy 10/10, in my top 3 favorite games of all time, and is an experience that transcends the video game medium and is an expression of pure, wonderful, joyous art. this game makes me feel like a child again - the kind of game that makes you feel nostalgic for something you never experienced before. If you love video games and you have yet to play Hollow Knight, please- please. Play this game. \r\n\r\nBorn too early to explore the stars, born too late to explore the seas; But born just in time to explore Hallownest. Love this game til the end of the Earth. GG",

I loved the music and artstyle and played for a good 12 hours before I neglected it and it became backlogged.... until 4 years later I decided to start a new save file and I played it properly all the way through to 100% completion and I can't express how great it was. I feel stupid for backlogging an actual masterpiece.\n\nThe world that Team Cherry have created is just unbelievable. It's clear that a lot of passion and care went into crafting it. For a derelict underground cave system, Hallowest feels so alive and rich with lore. This game doesn't tell you where to go, you have to explore yourself and are rewarded greatly for doing so. Discovering things accidentally in this game is such a cool experience, whether it's other characters, items, new areas, or just something that's simply \"cool\" and fun. \n\nThe game does get challenging and quite combat focused in the late game, but it never felt unfair. You just have to be prepared to get good at the game.\n\nThe visuals you can probably see from the trailer are just fantastic, and it only gets better the more unique areas you discover.\nThe soundtrack.... Christopher Larkin is actually a musical genius. Very good soundtrack, might be my favourite ever.\n\nGoing into this game blind is one of the best things you can do for yourself, it's just such a magical experience.\n\nOnly downside is after finishing everything there is to do you have to be forever tormented by the never ending wait for Silksong.",

Nothing is boring. Boss are hard at times but doable. \r\nZones at times are dark, scary, with no signs of exit anywhere. With no benches on sight and you are carrying tons of Geo, its intense and fun. At other times, slow and thoughtful.\r\nBought on sale for 2$.

        "review": "Hollow Knight is a game that, despite its widespread praise, left me feeling more frustrated than entertained. It’s undeniably visually stunning, with its hauntingly beautiful hand-drawn art style and atmospheric soundtrack. But unfortunately, the game’s style is where my praise ends.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the difficulty curve in Hollow Knight is not just steep—it’s brutal. While I enjoy challenging games, the lack of accessibility options or difficulty settings is a major oversight. For a game so heavily focused on combat precision and exploration, the punishing enemies and bosses often felt more like an exercise in frustration than skill development. There were too many moments where I felt like I was being punished by the game’s design rather than learning from my mistakes. The hitboxes on enemies and the protagonist feel inconsistent, and often the controls seem sluggish, leaving me blaming the game rather than my own input.\r\n\r\nThe vastness of the map, while impressive, quickly becomes overwhelming. The game does little to guide players, leaving many to wander aimlessly through vast, monotonous areas without any clear direction or purpose. While some may praise this “sense of exploration,” I found it more tedious than rewarding. Backtracking across the sprawling world becomes a tiresome slog, especially when progress often feels gated behind obscure mechanics or hard-to-find upgrades. There’s also a lack of fast travel points, which further exacerbates the frustration of revisiting previously explored areas. After a few hours, the game’s world starts to feel more like a chore than an exciting place to explore.\r\n\r\nThe lack of narrative depth is also an issue. While the minimalist storytelling approach works in some games, Hollow Knight feels needlessly cryptic. Important story beats are buried in vague dialogue or hidden in obscure corners of the map, leaving much of the lore inaccessible unless you’re willing to read fan wikis or spend hours deciphering obscure details. The game tries to be mysterious but ends up feeling pretentious and hollow (pun intended).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the checkpoint system is another source of frustration. Dying forces you to trek back through long, enemy-filled areas to recover your soul and currency, which can often lead to multiple deaths in succession. Losing valuable resources this way quickly becomes aggravating, and it feels more like an artificial way to inflate difficulty rather than add meaningful challenge.\r\n\r\nIn the end, while Hollow Knight is technically impressive and visually gorgeous, its punishing difficulty, lack of direction, and tedious exploration mechanics make it a game that’s hard to recommend to anyone except those who thrive on challenge for the sake of challenge. For many players, like myself, the frustration outweighs any potential enjoyment, leaving a hollow experience rather than a satisfying one.",

Its just great.  i hate that this was my first metroidvania because now i cant play any other one.  they just are not as good.  i did not even know i liked metroidvanias.  now... whats good about it?  The combat is great, the exploration amazing.  i love how the game forces you to learn the map by heart.  the platforming is great.  theres a little bit for almost everyone in this game.  you like hard platforming? right here, you like cool secrets and tons to colect? right here, you like convoluted story that you can be a conspiricy theorist about? also here, you love difficult combat challenges? it gets CRAZY, you want the perfect game to replay with a ranomizer?  How do you think i got 200 hours?  Do you just want a great game with cute charectors and all the things i said before but not crazy hard?  yeah just dont go for 112%  It teaches you about everything you get by letting you learn it yourself.  every other game needs to do it this way.  Anyways, top 2 Fav games along with Undertale. 10/10",

The visuals are hand-drawn in a special way I've never seen, there is a giant map to explore (I MEAN giant) and if exploration isn't your thing, we always have the 46 unique bosses, almost (I mean almost) all of which are crafted to perfection. And last, on both of the OSTs, I haven't heard a single soundtrack I'd consider bad. However, be prepared for lots of backtracking.",

From the dusty grays of Forgotten Crossroads to the opulent greens of Greenpath, each area has it's own identity compounded by Christopher Larkin's phenomenal score. The combat is tight, allowing for plenty of variation dependent on your play-style. The platforming is precise, providing the perfect challenge. \r\n   The world feels alive and lived in. Each NPC has their own personality no matter how brief their dialogue may be. However, this game is not for the faint of heart. If you grow frustrated with dying frequently this might not be the game for you. It is so layered that this review could easily be an essay, but I digress. To anyone up for the challenge, I absolutely recommend it!",

Certainly worth the wait!!!\nOnly Team Cherry could pull of something as magical as this game!\nNo amount of waiting would keep me from playing the sequel!\nGranted, they could maaaaaaaybe breathe now and then.\nWould like to know if they are alive and well, you know?? JK!!!\nHow hard is Hollow Knight? Very! How worth is Hollow Knight? VERY!!!\nEasy or not, I would play this whole game all over again! \nNever again will you come upon a game like this one. \n\n:)",

Extremely recommended (I use to write positive reviews, as I just finish and review games that I liked,  but being fair this game is certainly in another level; specially being an indie game...mindblowing taking in consideration its content). Every aspect of the game is fantastic; art, controls, combat, variety, all is perfect for me. The progression in challenge (specially bosses) is so good and exploring the vast map finding tons of secrets feels awesome. This two things combined create an awesome sensation of fulfilment specially if you go blind. It can be frustrating (specially optional bosses and  end-game challenges) but it doesn't matter as the game has captivated you already and the response is so perfect that you want to keep trying willing for more. In conclusion, it is a so satisfactory game to play, as I said earlier, one of (if not the) best objectively speaking as it is so so amazing in terms of creativity, sensation of fulfilment, level design , simplly but complex and fun comabt, ... it is so polished; being perfect in what in wants to be. Fortunnately I ve played now, and ist sequel will be released in just 4/5 years xd (honestly I prefer to wait, if the result is as good as it first part, which has set a very high standard tbh).\r\n",

Maybe some kids can kill this boss but a lot of younger kids can't. There should be levels, easy for younger kids, medium, and harder, for adults. The game is no fun for these kids that earn there hard earn money but can't defeat the bosses. Also, come on, it's 2024. When it's bed time, don't make the kid go to a bench to save the same. It should be able to save it where ever they are. This isn't the names without ROM chips. If I had to do over again, I would not buy this game.",

You can't... it's lauded because it deserves to be, the rabid crowds are right - this is simply one of the best games created so far.

There are few games i'll go out of my way to replay, especially ones with long playtime and having a busy work schedule, but this is one of those few. When Silksong eventually arrives, I will be more than eager to dive back into this world. Would highly recommend.",

It has been 6 years since I began playing this game and Hollow Knight is still my number one favorite game.\nThe map exploration, characters you meet, little side quest, the main story line, collecting of items, charms, grubs etc. it is just amazing!\n\nThe story of Hallownest is full of mysteries, making me want to know everything that happened/is going on. The characters you meet along your journey are interesting, and their dialogue is written amazingly (don't even get me started on the way the [spoiler]Hunters Journal[/spoiler] is written. Most of my favourite quotes come from there).\n\nThis is not an easy game. The boss fights are hard and when you step into a new area for the first time, it can be unforgiving. However, the game does help you with teaching how to overcome these hard challenges (not by taking you by the hand but by giving you the opportunity to train). And once you manage to survive these challanges, man, does it feel good. It was worth all my frustrations.\n\nTeam Cherry, I love this game and I cannot wait until Silksong comes out!! (please I beg you I have been waiting so longggg)",

        "review": "One of the best...if not THE best metroidvania games ever.  Only complaint in the entire game is after you beat the second boss, it is very unclear what to do if you don't use a guide.  Other than that, the art, the music, the story, the gameplay...they set a precedent for other similar games to strive for.  This game is just beautiful and packed to the brim with stuff to do.  Tons of optional bosses and areas.  And my favorite part...The Radiance.  True final boss took me 141 attempts.  And it never once felt unfair.  After I beat it I just felt sad that my adventure was over.   I cannot recommend this game highly enough. 9.5 out of 10.  Only 3 games out of the 1000's I have played rank higher.",
