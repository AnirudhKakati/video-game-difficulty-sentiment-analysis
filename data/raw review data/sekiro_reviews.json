Although this may sound tedious, I find it incredibly fulfilling to gradually learn how to counter a boss' attacks until you inevitably get to the stage of knowing the victory is just a couple attempts away. Difficult boss fights for me are most memorable and this game is full of them. This was the first FromSoftware game I've played and even though some consider it the hardest, I'd recommend it to any new player to the genre as it perfectly captures that feeling of triumph!",

Listen and learn what the game tells you for gameplay but if youre stuck and cant figure out where to go its more worth to look it up and continue to enjoy the game then give up like me.",

Classic missable NPC quests and extremely hidden stuff, I just used the internet to find the last collectibles at the end of the game. This game contains cheesy items and prosthetic super moves if you're not so good of a gamer but obviously I didn't need or use those. The game is not nearly as hard as people say it is but of course I am a master level Street Fighter 6 player so maybe I'm a little better than your average gamer. The hardest encounter in the game is not a boss but three random spear enemies standing outside a Buddhist temple. Last boss is cake if you mash parry.\r\n\r\nOverall I give this game a 9/10. I recommend it for anyone looking for a fun adventure through fictional China.",

        "review": "Best Fromsoft combat IMO, very limiting, yet very satisfying to master. Sometimes having more options =/ better game. Sometimes having 1 specially crafted system and the entire game built around that system can feel like a more catered experience. The time period being old Japan makes for beautiful lore and scenery. The attention to detail is laser focused, feels like 0 corners were cut on this passion project.\n\nThe lack of multiplayer is fine too. There is really no shortcuts in getting to the finish line- no summons, no min-maxing, no OP builds... just your sword, skills, prosthetics, and weapon arts. You have to stick with it though. The difference in not being able to hit the B or Circle button to get yourself out of sticky situations is a huge setback in terms of muscle memory at first, especially if you'd already sunk hundreds of hours in other fromsoft games. It's almost harder to get into if you're a diehard souls fan due to this fact specifically. But trust me, the payoff from persevering is a feeling you wont get in hardly any other video games. And once you get good at the system, you STAY good at the system. Besides attack and vitality upgrades, the gameplay is pretty much the same no matter what. So subsequent playthroughs allow you to retain the skills you've acquired, and makes it almost a completely different game.\n\nThe first time I played through this game, I quit on the demon of hatred because it was so brutal. But after looking up some guides (which in my opinion is necessary if you don't want to end up banging your head against a wall for unnecessary amts of time), I was able to persevere. Then the next boss, SSI, literally took me to a point where I'd never gone to as a gamer. I think that the creators realized that many people relied on cheese and summons to get through the previous games, so they consciously decided to create a game where you literally had no options than to simply git-gud. And I thought I had gotten good to be honest, until I reached this boss. There's almost like a fear that you get when you reach moments like this- like, is this even possible? Is there any possibility for me to complete this? That fear can either turn you away or you can put your head down and be tenacious. I chose the first option for the DoH the first time fighting it, but after coming back months later I decided to do the second option for the rest of the game. It was painful, and disheartening at times. But this game has such a great way of making you FEEL. Feel that you've actually accomplished something, that you actually conquered something. It legit teaches you how to persevere in some ways. And after beating SSI, the feeling was unlike anything I'd ever felt in a singleplayer game.\n\n 9.7/10 \n\nNot perfect because the game feels short, and not a whole lotta replay value ;(",

        "review": "Not a fan of Souls-like/Soulsbourne genre, but something about Sekiro just feels different. \n\nYou're woefully under equipped and under-skilled in the beginning, but with time and practice, you just get better. It took 30 hours of gameplay for me to feel like I can actually beat this game. Instead of focusing on builds, Sekiro requires you to master deflect/parry, sidesteps and counter attacks. Some people say this makes it more like a rhythm game in how the combat flows. Sekiro has some of the best combat systems I've come across in games.  \n\nThe tools you acquire over time help a lot, but defeating every single boss without using tools is doable, although extremely difficult. The precision and timing required in this game is quite challenging to master. However, Sekiro also gives you a lot of control unlike the usual clunkiness in movement that mars the genre. The sword fights feel epic and real.\n\nHighly recommend to anybody looking for a challenging action game involving some of the best swordfights in gaming. Deserves all the GOTYs it got in 2019.",

However, unlike Souls games, the game feels bad to play and does a poor job of making me care enough to learn the game. It sucks to live in the timeline where this game was released on PC instead of Bloodborne.\n\nEdit 10/14/24\nNow that I've had enough time for my salt levels to come down, I can explain a little better.\n\nIt comes down to the combat system. I dislike how fighting more than 2 enemies will destroy you. The parry system feels janky, like some of the timings feel off from what you see to when you would parry. There is a boss in red armor with like 4-5 gunner adds that gave me a lot of trouble. I was finally able to take them down with hit-and-run tactics after about 10 tries. Then I met the bird ninjas and well, it was gg for me.\n\nSkill Issue? Yeah. The combat just isn't clicking for some reason. I'll try again at some point and update accordingly.",

        "review": "Man, this game is incredible. Elden Ring was my first soulslike game, and I had heard so many positive things about sekiro that I decided to try it after I had done literally everything in elden ring. Sekiro is a fantastic and rewarding game. The combat in this game is just so rewarding. I feel like the difficulty of the game is much less punishing than elden ring, but it feels so satisfying to improve and beat a boss after many attempts (looking at you, genichiro). \r\n\r\nOf course, the game is much smaller than Elden ring, but absolutely worth $60 or whatever they charge. My first playthrough was about 50 hours, and my second playthrough was more like 5 hours.",

I didn’t think I was going to enjoy it as much as I did.\nI personally however found it quite an easy title, boss battles wasn’t that hard to start learning.\nThe fighting mechanics with the weapons was awesome, very easy controls to learn, bosses and other enemies was pretty awesome. The feel of the game keeping it in Japanese with English subtitles for myself really did make it all the more engaging.\nI did find it a bit weird in parts of having a story feel in a title like this and some parts of going to and from places to just carry on with the progression of the story was a bit ‘meh’. Although with this only negative of the game, I can see myself loading this title up once again to play some more.\nPlayed on my Steam Deck perfectly, controls and visuals just as good as my desktop PC.",

There is also gear and multiple ways to approach a situation that can make the battles much more manageable. I can not count how many times I said \"How the hell am I supposed to do something about that?!\" to continue playing and find a method around the difficult situation.\r\n\r\nThis being said, don't be afraid to take a break and come back to the game later. It is a very good game, but the difficulty can easily Frustrate you into playing significantly worse due to anger or impatience.",

The satisfaction that you get from parrying a boss's full combo is very intense like literally. This game is only hard until you manage to get a full grasp of the parry mechanic and once you do, it turns this game into something more enjoyable.",

Anyone who enjoys difficult fights and learning patterns should definitely play this one!",

You shouldn't hate dying because it's part of the process, I hope more games like this show up in the coming years. This level of difficulty brings me back to the games I've played in the 90s.\r\n\r\nIf you think you're dying too much in this game, you're wrong. But how can you improve that? I say, observe how you approach the battle and correct all the wrong things you're doing. They key is observation, not only of the enemy's movements but yours too. In my case, I always die because I push too hard until I learned that I need to take it slow and attack only at the right time. It also makes you feel like a real shinobi by weaving your sword with intent.",

        "review": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is still, even years later, even after Elden Ring, my favorite FromSoft game ever. And that isn't primarily because of the excellent story, the beautiful art design, or the stellar version of fictionalized Japan that has been crafted. No, it is mostly because of the insanely well-made combat system, which remains one of the finest in gaming. \n\nPeople have spent years comparing Sekiro's combat system to a rhythm game, and they aren't far off; the ebb and flow required to parry and strike in perfect sync with the opponents makes for one of the most (and possibly the single most) satisfying combat experiences around. Each battle is a dance, and you have to learn the steps. It just feels incredible.",

Every death let's you learn enemy attack patterns and their movement, and it sticks with you. \n\nThe combat in this game 9/10 - deflecting is very satisfying. Can't really say much as it is a more experience thing. I haven't given this a 10 because of a mechanic called fear - this is the worst part of the game honestly. Only a few enemies have it such as the shichimen warriors and the headless (all which are optional but they drop good loot which is very good to have). And if i'm correct one boss (true corrupted monk) has this mechanic. Yet it can easily be avoided with a certain prosthetic tool.\nThere is poison in this game but I didn't have any issues with it.\nProsthetic tools are something which you collect throughout the game, they provide useful abilities which can help and make game play more satisfying (and to a certain degree easier). They also make the dog enemies so much easier with the shurikan prosthetic group.\nThis game is designed for one versus one duels between the nps's.\n\nThe level design - 9/10. Generally there is many memorable areas, though some very forgotten ones. Best place for me was  fountainhead palace. worst place is the dungeon.\nYou have a grappling hook, so many areas are designed to allow you to use them. This can be used for stealth or to get passed a lot of enemies.\n\nStealth 7/10 - stealth is fun in this game but there are some problems such as too many enemies to a point where it gets annoying. \n\nBoss fights 10/10 - play the game to find out. One boss fight took me 5 hours (duo ape). For me personally for the harder boss fights, they took 3 hours roughly. But dying is a part of learning in these type of games.\n\nStory 8/10 - there is a story and i won't spoil it for you. PLAY THE GAME!!!!\n\nThere is many mini-bosses and they drop these items called beads. 4 beads are required to upgrade your vitality. 4 beads make up a bead necklace - there is 10 bead necklaces.\nBosses give you memories which are used to make your attack power stronger. \n\nwith this info - the way you get stronger in this game is by defeating bosses and mini-bosses. Struggling is achieving.\n\nDifficulty - varies as once you get a hang of the combat then it is not too bad compared to when you started.\n\noverall objectively it would be a 8-9/10, but personally i would say it's a 10/10.\n\nIf you read this - thank you very much. Have a good day, a good morning, a good afternoon and a good night!\n",

Even as someone who does like hard games, this really rode the line for me of just too frustrating to be fun. I got to the guardian ape on my first run and realized I had not really learned the mechanics of the game well, but by then the game was assuming that you had learned and was not giving you easy enemies anymore. So I restarted from the beginning, and had the feeling that I was having the amount of difficulty that I was \"supposed\" to have the second time around.\n\nAfter truly learning the game's mechanics though, it is really fun. The combat is very pure and while there's a couple of janky bits (the camera at times, occasional weird input buffer or non buffer that's tough to understand). The feeling of beating a hard boss is incredibly satisfying because you know you had to be perfect, or nearly perfect to get there. Great game, but expect it to take some serious effort before you fall in love.",

Remove/disable dragonrot, it is entirely counter to the whole point of a game where you attempt bosses many times.\n2. Losing 50% of your experience when you die with no way to recover it...huh? Just disable that garbage.\n3. Limited to 60fps, easily fixed with a fps unlock mod\n\nThe setting is very cool, characters are awesome and epic, and the good ending is realistic for a player that is paying attention (the same cannot be said for other FROM Software games lol). The graphics also hold up quite well considering the game's age.",

You can only be treated like a jerk so many times. I'm sick of having to kill trash mobs ever time i'm running back from the graveyard to fight a boss. I dont think that last part is applicable to this game though, which was nice about Sekiro",

        "review": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an exceptional addition to FromSoftware’s illustrious lineup, offering a unique blend of intense action, deep storytelling, and stunning visuals. Departing from the RPG elements of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro presents a focused experience that emphasizes skill, strategy, and a rich narrative.\n\nThe world of Sekiro is a breathtaking tapestry of Japanese aesthetics, blending lush landscapes, intricate temples, and meticulously designed environments. The attention to detail is remarkable, with every area feeling alive and immersive. From the serene beauty of the Ashina region to the haunting depths of the Senpou Temple, the visual storytelling draws you into a world filled with history and intrigue.\n\nThe combat in Sekiro is a game-changer. Rather than relying on the typical RPG mechanics, Sekiro emphasizes precision and timing. The posture system encourages players to engage in aggressive, skillful combat, rewarding parries and deflections. Mastering these mechanics transforms battles into a thrilling dance of death, where each encounter feels like a test of both skill and strategy. The diverse arsenal of tools and abilities, including the grappling hook, adds layers of depth and versatility to combat.\n\nTrue to FromSoftware’s reputation, Sekiro is unapologetically challenging. Each enemy encounter requires focus and determination, with boss fights that push players to their limits. However, the game rewards persistence and learning, making each victory feel earned and satisfying. The absence of traditional leveling mechanics shifts the focus from grinding to skill mastery, resulting in a rewarding experience that feels fresh and engaging. The sound design in Sekiro is equally impressive, with a haunting score and immersive audio that enhance the atmosphere. The clashing of swords, the cries of enemies, and the ambient sounds of nature create a rich audio landscape that draws players further into the experience.",

I regret spending 63$ freaking dollars and if i do get my refund i'm going to buy either Elden Ring or God of War Ragnarok. Trailers on Steam are badass though but I wouldn't pay full price.",

We both were very happy and cared for the cat more than ourselves. We almost went into debt trying to save our cat, until we did some quests, we got money. on like day 5 we let the cat outside the garage, we spent 5 minutes looking for it. Wasn't really a big of a deal. After a few days we were making very steady progress, and bought another cat this time it was a white one, we were Having A LOT of fun about making screenshots and clips. Really great game and mechanics. Until day 8 struck...\n...\nWe Spent until DAY 10 SEARCHING FOR THE CAT. I had an idea to \"cut down all the trees\" so that's what i did, i did it half an hour of cutting wood, the trees around our property in order to find the cat. I finally found it somewhere near Day 11, we both scolded the cat so hard. At the arrival of Day 11 wee had the cats in the garage for them not to escape again so we don't have to find them again. I was using the sawmill like usual, near the garage, getting planks for the fences. Until my friend wanted to check on the cats. We see that our orange cat from Day 1 has died....\n\nThe Depression has struck.\n\nI stare at the dead cat abosloutely speechless, rubbing my eyes and head, (german stare).\nWhile my friend has no choice but to skin it as he can't move the cat.\n\n\"Yeah, that's enough for today, get some sleep.\"\n\nI continue staring at the same spot I've been staring in, until I get disconnected when my friend logs off.\nWriting this review, this game has made me depressed.\n\n(I love the gameplay yet I may never touch this game again after this incident.)",

But From's decision to build Sekiro with a specific protagonist results in a masterful synergy of storytelling and gameplay. Being limited to one playable character focuses the various challenges of the game in ways the Souls series never could. And the presentation of the plot becomes more straightforward, with more meaningful interactions between you and the NPCs. This is arguably the best action game ever made.",

My expectation was that it would be insurmountable, and incredibly precise based on what I heard online but I'd say don't worry about it if you think the difficulty is unapproachable because it really is easy to abuse the mechanics to make it easy. I was a bit let down at this game's whole focus on the parry system because I feel like it wasn't fully thought out on how it affects the way a player approaches the meta or fine tuned. Once I came to the realization that health doesn't matter and that it is all about the posture gauge, it completely changed my approach to every fight in a way I felt was inelegant and cheesy. Boss fights went from being highly movement focused to instead being about planting my feet and timing my parries. Just not what I was hoping for in general when playing a game with such an agile Ninja character with a grappling hook. \n\nThat said, it is a good introduction to FromSoft games at least to me purely because of the lack of RPG mechanics and not having to worry about making an awful build based on the game not communicating properly to the player like I've heard friends moan about with the Dark Souls games. The big setpiece boss moments were very memorable and it's a lot of fun to just explore these more focused, smaller environments, especially with how dense these areas are with secrets.",

Is it a hard game? yes its very tough, but i find the learning curve not to be so high, its all abut repetition and learning the rhythm of the bosses. Once you get over that curve and start defeating bosses you feel like a bad ass like you're a boss your self. Contrary to what people say this game is not the hardest fromsoft game it cant be, it is a great game to break the ice if you're fromsoft newbie so by all means give it a shot.",

        "review": "The Treatment of Prisoners of War by Japan During World War II\n\nWorld War II saw many nations engage in brutal warfare, but the treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) by Imperial Japan stands out as particularly harsh. Japan's treatment of captured soldiers and civilians from Allied nations, as well as from China, violated international conventions and human rights. This essay explores the underlying factors that influenced Japan’s wartime conduct and the inhumane conditions POWs faced, examining both the cultural context and the long-lasting impact on those who survived.\n\nTo understand why Japanese forces treated POWs so poorly, it is essential to consider the cultural and ideological backdrop of the time. The Bushido code, a traditional samurai code of honor, placed great emphasis on loyalty and sacrifice. Under this code, surrender was seen as a disgraceful act, a notion that deeply influenced Japanese military ideology during World War II. Soldiers were expected to fight to the death rather than be captured, and as a result, the Japanese saw POWs as dishonorable and unworthy of respect. This mindset contributed to the mistreatment and dehumanization of captured soldiers from the United States, Britain, Australia, China, and other nations.\n\nJapan’s treatment of POWs contravened the Geneva Conventions, which established the rights and protections for prisoners of war. Although Japan was not a signatory to the 1929 Geneva Convention, it was still expected to abide by international norms regarding the treatment of POWs. However, Japanese forces regularly violated these norms. Many POWs were subjected to forced labor in dangerous conditions, often in Japanese factories or construction projects, such as the infamous Burma Railway. Thousands died from malnutrition, overwork, and physical abuse. Disease was rampant, as POWs were given little medical care and lived in overcrowded, unsanitary camps.\n\nThe suffering of Chinese prisoners during World War II, especially in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), represents one of the most severe aspects of Japan's wartime atrocities. Unlike Western POWs, Chinese soldiers and civilians were not afforded even the most basic protections under international law. The Japanese military often refused to recognize Chinese captives as legitimate POWs, instead classifying them as bandits or insurgents, which led to particularly brutal treatment.\n\nThe infamous **Nanjing Massacre** (1937), also known as the Rape of Nanjing, exemplifies the extreme violence perpetrated against Chinese prisoners and civilians. After capturing the Chinese city of Nanjing, Japanese forces committed widespread atrocities, including mass executions, torture, and sexual violence against tens of thousands of Chinese civilians and soldiers who had surrendered. It is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 people were killed during the six weeks of terror. Many Chinese POWs were summarily executed, while others were used in forced labor or subjected to horrific medical experiments.\n\nIn addition to the atrocities committed in Nanjing, Chinese POWs and civilians were also exploited for Japan’s wartime industry. They were forced into hard labor in mines, factories, and construction projects, often under deadly conditions. The Japanese military also conducted biological and chemical warfare experiments on Chinese prisoners in facilities like **Unit 731**, a secret military unit that carried out experiments involving lethal diseases, frostbite, and vivisection without anesthesia. The suffering endured by these prisoners remains one of the most horrifying aspects of Japan’s wartime conduct.\n\nOne of the most notorious examples of Japanese brutality was the Bataan Death March in 1942. After the fall of Bataan in the Philippines, approximately 75,000 American and Filipino soldiers were forced to march over 60 miles to a prison camp under extreme conditions. Along the way, thousands died from exhaustion, dehydration, and beatings by Japanese guards. This event became a symbol of the cruelty faced by POWs under Japanese captivity.\n\nSimilar atrocities were carried out across the Pacific, but Chinese soldiers and civilians often faced even worse conditions due to Japan’s longstanding enmity toward China. Japanese propaganda dehumanized the Chinese, viewing them as inferior, which fueled the brutalization of both POWs and civilians.\n\nThe impact of Japan’s treatment on POWs was long-lasting. Survivors of Japanese POW camps often suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), malnutrition, and other chronic health problems for the rest of their lives. The psychological toll was equally significant. Many POWs struggled with feelings of shame and guilt for having been captured, in part due to the cultural stigma of surrender that Japan projected. The trauma endured in the camps also left a legacy of strained post-war relations between Japan and the countries whose soldiers and civilians had been mistreated, particularly China.\n\nThe emotional and physical damage caused by Japan’s wartime atrocities left deep scars on Chinese society. Families who lost loved ones during the Nanjing Massacre or saw their relatives subjected to forced labor and experimentation often struggled with collective trauma. The suffering of Chinese POWs and civilians has continued to influence Sino-Japanese relations to this day, with demands for further apologies and reparations from Japan remaining a contentious issue.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, many Japanese military leaders were tried for war crimes. The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, held from 1946 to 1948, prosecuted several high-ranking officials for their roles in the mistreatment of POWs and civilians. While some were convicted and sentenced to death or imprisonment, many of those involved in lower-level crimes went unpunished.\n\nIn the case of China, the post-war justice process was complicated by the rise of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. While Japan has offered apologies for its wartime conduct, these gestures have been seen as insufficient by many in China. Survivors and their families continue to advocate for formal recognition of the atrocities committed and for greater reparations, though the issue remains a sensitive topic in Japanese society.\n\nJapan’s treatment of POWs and civilians during World War II, particularly in China, remains one of the darkest aspects of the Pacific theater. Driven by a cultural code that devalued surrender and compounded by a lack of adherence to international law, Japanese forces subjected thousands of POWs and civilians to horrific conditions. The physical and psychological impact on survivors was profound, and while post-war efforts have sought to bring justice and reconciliation, the legacy of these atrocities endures. The suffering of Chinese POWs and civilians, in particular, continues to affect regional relations and serves as a stark reminder of the horrors of war.",

        "review": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice – 9.5/10\nCombat (10/10)\n\nStrength: Sekiro’s combat system is flawless, an absolute masterclass in precision. Every fight, from the lowest grunt to the most fearsome boss, is a dance of timing, deflection, and parrying. The Posture system encourages aggressive play, making defense just as vital as offense, creating a high-stakes, adrenaline-fueled experience. Unlike other FromSoftware titles, there’s no turtling behind shields or magic crutches—you either learn to master the sword or face brutal defeat.\nCritique: While the combat is exceptional, its steep learning curve might alienate players who are new to the genre or accustomed to the slower, more methodical pace of other Soulsborne games. There’s no real alternative playstyle—Sekiro offers no magic, no ranged combat (outside of gadgets), and no character customization, which can make replayability feel more limited than other FromSoftware titles. That said, this focus is both a strength and a potential drawback, depending on what you want from the game.\nBoss Design (10/10)\n\nStrength: Sekiro’s bosses are the best in FromSoftware’s repertoire—period. Each encounter feels unique, testing a different skill or aspect of your mastery over the game’s mechanics. Bosses like Genichiro, Isshin Ashina, and The Guardian Ape have become legendary in gaming circles for their difficulty and design. Each fight is a tactical puzzle that forces players to adapt and think on their feet.\nCritique: The bosses are punishing, to a level that might feel unfair to some players. There’s an inherent difficulty spike that could be discouraging for players not accustomed to FromSoftware’s combat philosophy. While difficulty is part of Sekiro’s DNA, it does border on brutal at times, with certain bosses feeling overwhelming until players spend hours mastering their attack patterns. This kind of grind might feel excessive to those looking for more balanced difficulty scaling.\nWorld Design and Exploration (8/10)\n\nStrength: The world of Sekiro is beautifully designed, a detailed reimagining of Sengoku-era Japan with mythological twists. The verticality of the level design, thanks to the Grappling Hook, adds a sense of freedom and exploration that was absent in previous FromSoftware titles. Every nook and cranny is packed with secrets, and environmental storytelling is a staple, letting players uncover lore and hidden items through careful exploration.\nCritique: While Sekiro’s world is visually stunning, it lacks the sprawling interconnectedness of previous Soulsborne games. The open-ended, maze-like structure of Dark Souls or Bloodborne is traded in for a more linear experience. There are far fewer optional areas and secrets compared to Elden Ring or Dark Souls, meaning the game feels more constrained in its world design. Exploration is encouraged, but the game is still tightly focused, which can feel like a step backward for those who love the interconnected worlds of Miyazaki’s earlier works.\nStorytelling (8/10)\n\nStrength: Sekiro’s narrative is much more direct than Soulsborne games, giving us a clear protagonist with a defined goal—rescuing the Divine Heir, Kuro, and breaking the cycle of immortality. The game’s exploration of themes like loyalty, sacrifice, and mortality is fascinating and gives weight to the character’s journey. The story is delivered with more clarity than usual for a FromSoftware title, which helps ground the world in emotional stakes.\nCritique: However, Sekiro’s story, while clear, lacks the emotional depth found in more narrative-heavy games. Compared to Red Dead Redemption 2 or even The Witcher 3, Sekiro’s story is more functional than profound. The character of Wolf (Sekiro) is somewhat emotionally detached, which can make it hard for players to feel deeply connected to him compared to the personal struggles of characters like Arthur Morgan or Kratos. The supporting cast, while memorable, is somewhat underdeveloped, and players might find themselves wishing for deeper character arcs.\nStealth Mechanics (7.5/10)\n\nStrength: Sekiro introduces stealth mechanics, which allow players to approach situations with more strategy. Crouching, hiding in tall grass, and taking down enemies silently adds a layer of gameplay that was absent in previous FromSoftware titles, and it helps create a unique pace that alternates between frenetic combat and quiet planning.\nCritique: The stealth, while functional, feels underdeveloped compared to true stealth games like Metal Gear Solid or Hitman. It’s more of an accessory to combat rather than a fully fleshed-out system. Once you’re spotted, stealth becomes irrelevant, and the game forces you into direct combat. There’s no depth to the stealth mechanics, no gadgets or meaningful tactics beyond basic avoidance. For a game that tries to add stealth as a major component, it feels half-baked compared to the precision and detail of the combat system.\nInnovation and Legacy (9/10)\n\nStrength: Sekiro is one of the most innovative FromSoftware titles. It revolutionizes combat by focusing on parrying and posture-breaking instead of the traditional health-based system. The introduction of resurrection mechanics adds a fresh twist to death and combat, forcing players to reconsider when and how to use their second life. This creates a tense dynamic where every death matters more than ever.\nCritique: Despite its innovations, Sekiro doesn’t have the same legacy-defining impact as Dark Souls. Its focus on a single playstyle limits its appeal compared to Soulsborne games, which offer a wide variety of builds and strategies. For those who love the freedom of choice in previous titles, Sekiro’s rigid design can feel like a step backward. The game’s innovations are brilliant, but they come at the cost of replayability and build diversity—a key aspect of why people love the Souls series. It’s a game designed to be played in one very specific way, and that lack of flexibility may turn off some fans of FromSoftware’s previous work.\nPacing and Structure (9.5/10)\n\nStrength: Sekiro is tightly structured, with little to no filler content. The game’s pacing is relentless, throwing challenging bosses and enemies at the player in a way that consistently keeps you on edge. There’s almost no downtime, which enhances the feeling of danger and intensity. Boss encounters are spaced out perfectly to keep tension building without feeling overwhelming.\nCritique: While Sekiro’s pacing is strong, its linear nature means the game can feel claustrophobic at times. There’s a lack of freedom to explore different areas in the way you can in other FromSoftware games. The game’s structure is more reminiscent of an action game like Nioh than an open-ended RPG, which might leave some players wishing for more exploration and discovery.\nFinal Verdict: 9.5/10\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a masterpiece of combat design—arguably the best combat system ever created in a FromSoftware game. It forces players to adapt and master its systems, resulting in a deeply rewarding experience for those who are up for the challenge. Its bosses are legendary, its world is beautifully crafted, and its tight focus on skill-based combat makes it a standout among FromSoftware’s catalog.\n\nHowever, its narrative lacks the emotional depth of other narrative-driven games, and its stealth mechanics feel underdeveloped. The game's rigid focus on a single playstyle limits replayability and build diversity, which may turn off players looking for the flexibility and customization found in Soulsborne games.\n\nWhile Sekiro is a remarkable achievement, it doesn’t quite have the same replayability or build freedom that defines the legacy of the Dark Souls series. Nevertheless, it’s a must-play for fans of tactical combat and those who love a brutal, skill-driven experience.\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is, above all, a true challenge for the player. It doesn’t just ask you to play—it demands that you learn, adapt, and grow! LOVE IT!",

The story wasn't that great but for what it lacks in the narrative experience it more than makes up for with the smoothest sword fighting gameplay I've had the opportunity to experience and be immersed in. \n\nBeing my first Fromsoftware game to play to completion, I finally understand the formula that makes Souls games amazing and why people are always talking about them. Sekiro was very hard but not so hard that it makes you want to break something. The challenge is in learning and mastering your sword which I think is what makes it so incredibly fun. Parrying and Mikiri Counter are so incredibly satisfying that I yearned to master these while fighting the plethora of unique bosses and feeling like a badass after defeating them. The [spoiler]Genichiro[/spoiler] battle will go down as the game defining battle for me as it's when everything finally clicked and I realized that I couldn't just button mash my way through fights and hope to win. I could write so much more about how amazing this game is but I'll leave it at that. \n\nIncredible game. A masterclass in sword battle mechanics.  \n\n[h2][spoiler]死[/spoiler][h2]",

        "review": "A masterpiece! A must-have action-adventure game! Overall score: 10/10\n\nIn my opinion, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is one of the most rewarding action games of its generation. The difficulty is unforgiving, but it never feels unfair - each failure teaches you something new. It's a game that demands patience, precision, and persistence, but the sense of accomplishment after defeating a difficult boss is unmatched. If you're up for a challenge, Sekiro delivers one of the most satisfying gaming experiences out there.\n\nStory: 10/10\nSekiro offers a tightly woven narrative set in a beautifully reimagined Sengoku period of Japan. You play as a shinobi named Wolf, tasked with protecting a young lord known as Kuro, who is the key to an ancient bloodline that grants immortality. The story is rich in Japanese mythology and history, with themes of loyalty, honor, and mortality at its core.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nVisually, Sekiro is stunning. The environments are beautifully detailed, from serene Japanese temples to grotesque, twisted forests. The character designs are equally impressive, particularly the boss encounters, each of which feels distinct and memorable. The game’s art direction conveys a mix of beauty and horror, further immersing you in its unique world.\n\nSound: 10/10\nThe sound design is stellar, complementing the atmosphere perfectly. The ambient sounds of nature, clashing swords, and the weighty impact of each deathblow immerse you in the world. The musical score, particularly during boss fights, is intense and emotional, amplifying the high-stakes combat. Voice acting (available in both Japanese and English) is also excellent, lending authenticity to the game's historical setting.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nSekiro focuses on precise, skill-based combat. The swordplay is all about timing, deflecting, and exploiting enemy weaknesses. The addition of the posture system brings a fresh approach to the action, where breaking your opponent’s posture is key to victory. While it is brutally challenging, each death feels like a learning opportunity. Stealth mechanics and the grappling hook add variety to the combat, and exploration is rewarding, with hidden paths and secrets scattered throughout the world. While the sword vs sword combat is beautifully choreographed, the sword vs spear combat is clearly the weak point of the game. Spear attacks are difficult to read and block or deflect, because of suboptimal hitboxes and frustrating camera angles.\n\nReplay Value: 10/10\nThere are multiple endings to uncover, and the combat mechanics are so rewarding that many players will want to replay just for the satisfaction of mastering its systems. New Game Plus mode provides an even greater challenge, and the game's tight gameplay encourages repeat playthroughs to refine your skills. The extra content in the Gauntlets of Strength sets the player against \"improved\" versions of some already very challenging bosses.\n\nFavorite quote:\n\"Hesitation is defeat.\" - Isshin, the Sword Saint",

Enemies can be very punishing and you often find multiple smaller minions thrown into boss fights creating an almost artificial sense of difficulty, but it's a solid game at the core and one-on-one boss fights are where this game really shines. The mikiri counter is a good way to spice up the combat and add an alternative to just dodging or deflecting and you get other, less important skills throughout to mix things up a bit. The emphasis is on deflections and parries though, and traditional soulslike veterans used to dodge rolling through attacks will likely need time to mentally adjust to this one. Overall, a pretty good game.",

You play as a shinobi named Wolf, who seeks to rescue his kidnapped lord and take revenge on his enemies.\n\nThe combat is precise and rewarding, focusing on deflection and timing rather than brute force. It emphasizes agility and stealth, with a unique posture system that forces you to break your enemy's defense for a finishing blow.\n\nThe story is rich but subtly told, requiring exploration to uncover lore. The world design is interconnected and offers diverse, gorgeous environments. However, the difficulty curve can be punishing, which may frustrate some players.\n\nIf you enjoy a tough but fair challenge with fluid swordplay and a rich atmosphere, Sekiro is an outstanding experience. Every victory feels hard-earned and satisfying.",

Start the fight over\r\n\r\nUnfriendly retry design might've been acceptable back in 2011 when Dark Souls was a fresh idea on the market, but not now out of a developer as seasoned as From Software. You will die far more often in this Souls-like game than others and it's a very fast paced action game; that is to say, this problem is especially jarring. Also, with the removal of bloodstain recovery, it feels like there's less player incentive not to give up. Very disappointing, considering how interesting the combat system is that I want to enjoy.",

        "review": "Initial Thoughts: \nFrom playing many souls like games, this is the only game I do not enjoy from the get go. Everything hinges on reaction times which itself is poorly designed. Regardless of how many skills you acquire, if you accidentally press the wrong button during a perilous engagement you are punished with being near death. This is the same whether it is a ordinary mob or a boss. \nAnother aspect I do not like is the fact that you lose Exp and coins upon death with no way of getting them back.\nThese two 'features' combined make this more of a rage inducing experience than a challenging one.\n\nAfter Thoughts (completed one play-through):\nThis is my least favourite 'souls like' game. \nAs you progress, the perilous attacks from mobs are less lethal due to increased health but is still annoying especially when in a group of enemies. Losing exp and coins on death is frustrating and I do not see the point in it, as it just forces a player to farm if required. \nThe lack in customisation of apparel and swords was disappointing. So was the enemy variety. \n\n\nI get FromSoftware tried to do something different but it could have been better and with such a high rating on steam I was expecting so much more. \nAt the current price I would not recommend it. \n6/10",

The deflect feature is so satisfying and quite intuitive, though it certainly does counter spam deflecting which is nice, means that you do have to learn the bosses moves to their entirety. Went for the purification ending and somehow fluked sword saints third phase on my first time with the lightning reversal. Got super lucky there. Only 'big' boss I skipped during my run was the demon of hatred which I honestly just didn't find fun. Top 3 favourite bosses for sure were sword saint, owl father and genichiro.\nEdit: Came back and beat demon of hatred, probs the only boss in the game that I would consider bad. Such a wasted good design.",

        "review": "There are some spoilers, so read at your own discretion.\n\nIt took me 16 hours to beat the game for the first time, and here are my thoughts on it.\n\nI'm not new to FromSoftware Games. I have beaten Dark Souls 1, 2, 3, and Elden Ring. I have played Sekiro before, but I only got past Gyoubu and Genichiro, and then I quit when I found Guardian Ape (didn't even get mortal blade).\n\nBosses\n\nThe way I'm going to rank the bosses is by how fun they were to fight since all the bosses were kind of mid for me since they were all practically the same (deflect, counter, jump, and so on).\n\nGyoubu Owina\nIt took a while, but a fun \"learning\" boss for the different mechanics in the game. (6/10)\n\nLady Butterfly\nReally fun, to be honest. Quick, fun mechanics and not too hard. (9/10)\n\nGenichiro Ashina\nDear Lord, help me with this one. Holy, it took me a long time to beat him. I probably spent around 2-3 hours on him, and his bow attacks can go suck a dragon. (7/10)\n\nFolding Screen Monkeys\nSince I already knew about its gimmick, it didn't take long I just had to find out how to kill them in each of their areas. Fun nonetheless. (eh/10)\n\nGuardian Ape\nAlready knew about his second fase but still took a long time (probably around 1-1.5 hours). I feel like it does not really fit in with the hole-defelct attacks thing, so I find it rather hard to like it. It has a nice design and a fun twist, but it does not really fit in. (5/10)\n\nCorrupted Monk\nI totally forgot about this one, so I don't really know.\n\nHeadless Ape\nWhen I first found this fight, I was ready to quit since I couldn't be bothered by another Guardian ape and its pet. My friend told me to just use the mortal blade and got it right after. I guess I just made it harder in my head than it actually was. (4/10)\n\nGreat Shinobi Owl\nHe was REALLY fun for me. I really like this fight it felt simple yet advanced. He was not too hard, and it never really felt unfair. (9/10)\n\nTrue Corrupted Monk\nI beat her so quick I forgot everything about her. She only really took about 5 tries, if I remember right (skipped second fase with a deathblow from the tree). (5/10)\n\nDivine Dragon\nFun gimmick but kind of lagluster and didn't really feel like there was a purpose for this fight other than needing the item, so they plunked him in as a boss. (4/10)\n\nDemon of Hatred\nI cheesed the hell out of him.\n\nIsshin, The Sword Saint\nThis was a fun fight. It took some time, but we got it in the end. The hardest part was definitely the spear phase. The first part was easy enough, and the last phase I just waited for the lightning, and then it was straight forward. (9/10)\n\nAreas\nI'm going to rank the areas on fun, looks, feel, and enemies\n\nAshina Reservoir\nThe starting area of the game It looks nice but doesn't serve much since it's the starting area. (5/10)\n\nDilapidated Temple\nThe \"Hub\" of the game. I really like the look and feel of it. It's sad that there isn't much to do there other than the memory and prosthetic. (8/10)\n\nAshina Outskirts\nSame deal as the starting area there isn't really much here until late game, where I didn't really go there to much. The atmosphere is boring, and the enemies are mid and annoying later in the game. (4/10)\n\nHirata Estate\nThe atmosphere is really nice, but that's about it. There are some useful items here, but I never used them. Since Lady Butterfly is here and her arena is nice, it's a solid 7/10.\n\nAshina Castle\nOh boy, where to begin. I really didn't like this place. It's confusing, and the enemies are annoying and even worse later in the game. There are 2 fun bosses here though, so 6/10.\n\nSenpou Temple\nIt took me some time to find, but it's a really good-designed area. The monks are not too hard, and the atmosphere is really soothing and calm. It's a nice change from all the snow in the earlier parts. (8/10)\n\nSunken Vally\nOne of the most boring places of the game, to be honest. The gunfort is hell, the snake is a boring gimmick, and the boss in the fort is just not fun. (3/10)\n\nSunken Vally Passage\nThe Guardian Ape area/arena is really nice. Again, its a nice change of pace from all the snow. (7/10)\n\nAshina Depths\nYeah, this place can go fuck itself. (3/10)\n\nMibu Village\nEnemies can be a bit annoying, but the atmosphere is nice, and the look of the place is really nice as well. (8/10)\n\nFountainhead Palace\nBy far the best area in the game. God, I love this place. The enemies are a bit annoying, but by this point in the game, I was either good enough to deal with them or I just ran past them. The atmosphere is just so good I love it. It's probably one of my favourite places in any of the Souls games. (10/10)\n\nSekrio 8.5/10 overall\nDS3 10/10\nDS2 6/10\nDS1 7/10\nER 9.5/10",

I can remember my joy, as I finally beat the second boss. It was a tough fight for me and I couldnt manage to beat the next ones. Therefore, I quit the game. It was years later when I gave it another chance, the fourth time I started from the beginning by now. But then, it finally made \"click\". I was able to grow and continue until I even beat the game. It still makes me happy thinking about it. I went into NG+ and when I encountered the second boss again, I noticed how easy the fight was. Looking back at my struggle and effort, I am proud of the fact that I didnt gave up and worked my way to obtain every achievement. I feel like this game made me stronger as a person. It is a wonderful experience that I recommend to everyone. And always remember: hesitation is defeat. Thank you for reading.",

[/strike]\nCombination of [b] good narrative [/b], [b] strong gameplay mechanics [/b] and [b] process of learning [/b] giving you most immersive game of From Software studio. It's linear anti-souls story one hundred percent with amazing sword combat you'll never seen before. It will be so satisfying for you when realization comes out. This game can be beaten without any guide because world in this game is compact so it can be remembered for months when taking a break like i did myself. Simple and sharp. True masterpiece!\n\nFew words about PC version:\n- i'm not recommending any unnofficial easy mods because of respecting game designers\n- higly recommending fps unlock mods (dll/background app) for this game because it's not breaking anything in game engine",

I've always said that Dark Souls teaches you how to block, Bloodborne teaches you how to dodge and Sekiro teaches you how to parry. At least that's how it made sense to me during release orders. \r\n\r\nOne of the main mechanics in Sekiro is resurection, everything hits pretty hard but that's okay because if you get combo'd and go down, you get one resurection per health bar you've taken off the boss. This leaves some room for error and allows the world to show you just how tough these enemies are.\r\n\r\nThere's multiple endings and like all Souls games there's hidden and optional bosses for you to work towards which affords a lot of replayability, there's also an abundance of side quests which you can easily miss which offer a variety of items.\r\n\r\nSekiro is very parry heavy but its easier to parry in this than it is in other souls games, its all about posture/stance breaking to get an instant kill as opposed to just doing a bunch of damage.\r\n\r\nOverall, Sekiro is a game that means a lot to me, I've spent a lot of time in this game especially considering there's only one way to play unlike other souls games, the combat is just so satisfying, the musical score is phenomenal and its one of the few souls games where I enjoy more or less every single boss. \r\n\r\n10/10, I still don't get bored of this game.",

Learning the combat system is one of the most rewarding elements of the game and overall in the series. All the characters have their own storylines and secrets and reward you for eavesdropping with extra bosses in the game. Best souls game.",

        "review": "I see a lot of people comparing it to Elden ring and such, saying this game is bad cause it dosen't let you build a character, mind you these are 2 seperate games, so keep that in mind, but if someone wants to talk about skill, personally sekiro is where it's at. I own both, elden ring is my worst purchase in video game history, personally. I beat a few bosses and tbh it was less about it being hard tho im sure it is and more about it being a ROLL ROLL ROLL ROLL, DEFLECTIONS?? THAT SHIELD ON UR HAND?? NO, NO, BAD, DEFENSE IS ROLL ROLL, ABUSE THOSE I- FRAMES, OH THAT ATTACK HIT U IN THE FACE MID ROLL? NO WORRIES, DOSEN'T COUNT. Safe to say i was bored out of my mind, i couldnt bring myself to try my hardest, idk how u ppl do it, the game, the systems, the opponents are greaat but the combat is so disgusting, i like games that require skill, not a broken i-frame system. Sekiro however, i got my backside handed to me more than 100 times by some bosses and i was not even bored but instead mad cz i was bad at parrying and finding openings, but the perry system atleast works, it felt like i got better cause the defense was there, animation, timing and everything, i actually blocked hits not glitched through them. Sekiro taught me how to play the ultimate sword game, it was relentless on me but not in the pointless way like i felt elden ring combat was,  tell u the truth i tried refunding sekiro , NOT CAUSE IT WAS BAD, but cause i thought the game was way 2 hard for me and i knew i was the issue, but i kept at it and conquered it. So if you want a skill based game that will help u in all other sword games u ever play, this is it. You'll come out with better reaction time, some loss of hair but also feeling very accomplished .. this is all my personal opinion.",

        "review": "[b][i]Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice[/i][/b] is an action game in the fantasy Japanese setting during the Warring States period. The most important thing to know is that Sekiro is not a Souls-like - the similarities end with the bonfire (Sculptor’s idol) and the Estus (Gourd) systems (and the engine). There is only one class and it is an armourless katana wielder. The face-to-face combat is extremely uncomfortable and built around parrying (i.e. the player’s reaction time), but the location design and the PC controls are great.\n\nThe protagonist, called Wolf, is a shinobi, an assassin, guarding a resurrection-granting child. The said child gets kidnapped early on and the story is centred on helping him. The fictional state where it is happening, Ashina, is on the brink of defeat by the Interior Ministry as it seeks to “unify” Japan. However, Wolf does not care, because he is a shinobi and neither Ashina clan nor Japan have cared or helped him, therefore, they can kill each other as much as they like.\n\nAmong the differences from Souls-likes, from defeating foes, one gains sen (money) and skill experience, which provides skill points. In order to spend the latter, it is necessary to find skill books. There are several of them, some are given freely, some are found, others require completing NPC quests. The passive skills can drop from bosses, be found during exploration or bought from merchants. The health, posture, and attack power increase by collecting prayer beads (mostly, from the mini-bosses) and main story bosses respectively. Additionally, there are ninja tools, such as shurikens or flamethrowers, which must be found and crafted. They also require spirit emblems to be used. Other consumables provide different bonuses and abilities as well. \n\nAdditionally, the main character can jump and quite well, especially with the assassin prosthetic tools. The fall damage is minimal and in case if one does fall from a cliff, the MC is teleported back to the closest solid ground with some damage taken. The MC also can swim and dive. The traversal in general feels intuitive and engaging. \n\nThe areas are gorgeous, diverse, and fun to explore. They also change as the in-game time passes (with the defeats of the main bosses), with the foes growing in strength. And there are different interconnected paths to pursue, like in a Metroidvania or the first [i]Dark Souls[/i]. \n\nIt should be mentioned that some side quests might become impossible to complete if the relevant NPC dies. The critical NPCs, though, cannot be killed before the story allows it. There are some choices for the main story and the side quests, with the certain conditions to achieve specific outcomes. \n\nThe stealth system is functional and incorporated both in exploration and combat. Occasionally, it is possible to start a boss encounter with a Deathblow, shortening the battle. In general, it is strongly preferable to use any tools or the player’s skills to avoid open combat, for it is horrible. \n\nThe PC native input devices, keyboard and mouse, are comfortable to use and the controls are rebindable, with 5-button mice supported from the start. I have not encountered any bugs, though I think that Steam achievements do not work offline. \n\nThere are some poor design decisions, such as the save management system being done through Windows Explorer (the game auto-saves every minute, so it can serve as a quick save), but most notably, the open combat encounters. A few of them are unavoidable, though the stealth and consumables can make most of them tolerable. The protagonist does not have poise - any slap stunlocks for a second, while it is also unable to remain facing the target-locked while moving or switch to parrying fast enough. Considering that many bosses have additional foes in their arena, getting stunned by one of them and receiving a full attack from the boss is possible if one is not careful. \n\nAdditionally, not all bosses are possible to backstab even if one is quiet and it makes sense in terms of story to open the encounter with an attack instead of yapping. Most boss battles have several phases, but, annoyingly, in some of them, the boss’ moveset changes significantly, while the previous phases still have to be replayed on defeat. \n\nFinally, many bosses and mini-bosses are repeated. It is explainable for the Spears of Ashina or the assassins, but seeing the sumo wrestler-turned-bandit four times is ridiculous. \n\nOverall, the experience is positive if one avoids the open combat as much as possible or mods the inconveniences out. It must be noted that I did not purchase the game for the full price, otherwise, I would be more hesitant to recommend it.",

I would recommend this to literally anyone, as the game is only as hard as you really make it to be, and with minimal effort and a little bit of reaction time this game is easy.",

There's something incredibly inspiring in bashing your head against the wall until the wall crumbles! \n\nThat being said, the game is not exactly what I was expecting. My impression was that it's going to be an incredibly polished game where my skill will be the only deciding factor on how each fight goes. Unfortunately there's a degree of jank that makes the game fall short of pure perfection. \n\n- The biggest issue is the absolutely psychotic camera behavior, sometimes it ends up showing you some random wall or the floor while you're getting your shit kicked in. This is especially bad in confined spaces.\n\n- Fighting multiple enemies at once can be a massive pain due to how the locking/toggle is implemented. Feels clumsy as hell.\n\n- For some reason the lock-on will sometimes disappear if the enemies get too close, in a game based on sword fights... why?!\n\n- Not directly related to the gameplay, but achievements won't unlock if you play offline. And you won't be able to get them later.\n\n\nBeyond that this was an incredibly satisfying game with some of the crispest combat I've experienced. A solid 9/10!",

The world is beautiful, the combat is so fluid. And yes, this game is very difficult, but its possible if you put in the effort to learn it. Coming from a person who had quit the game several times in the past, it is not impossible. When you finally master it, it feels damn good.",

The textures all look a bit brownish and not very crisp, and the lighting is dull.\n\nIt also has a bad console feeling for me, e.g., the way you use consumables, or the fact they show a modal dialog with detailed description of an item every time you pick something up because there is not visual difference between items in the world. The camera is weird, it feels too close to the protagonist for me.\n\nThat being said, it has deep and brutal combat and souls-like gameplay, with the typical emphasis on fighting super-sized bosses, in a Japanese theme. If that's you cup of tea, you may like even though I did not not.",

Set in a beautifully crafted version of Sengoku-era Japan, the game follows the journey of a shinobi named Wolf on a mission of rescue and revenge.\r\nThe combat system is unique and demands precision, focusing on posture and timing rather than brute force. This makes every battle a thrilling test of skill. The game’s difficulty is high, but each victory feels incredibly rewarding.\r\nVisually, Sekiro is stunning, with detailed environments and atmospheric sound design that immerse you in its world. The story is engaging, filled with rich lore and memorable characters.\r\nOverall, This is a must-play for those who enjoy challenging and rewarding gameplay. It’s a true masterpiece in the action-adventure genre.",

As a long-time fan of their Dark Souls series, I found Sekiro to be an even greater challenge, possibly their hardest game to date. The intense difficulty, however, is matched by an unparalleled sense of accomplishment. Mastering the parry system and executing the Mikiri Counter offers a level of satisfaction that is truly second to none.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other games I play through once and move on, Sekiro captivated me so much that I completed it over four times, getting each and every endings and achievements. I typically don't chase achievements, but the sheer enjoyment I experienced kept me coming back for more. The game not only challenges your skills but also rewards persistence in ways few others do.",

Forget summons in this game it is pure git gud. Master deflect and makiri counter and you can achieve anything in this game. You play as Sekiro, a shinobi sworn to protect the devine heir until his last breath. You will face powerful shinobies, so be prepared. Lastly a piece of advice, never HESITATE. HESITATION IS DEFEAT! Good luck and GIT GUD ;3 (Recommended only for expirienced Souls players and definitely not for new to the genre).",

        "review": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a masterpiece that stands out in the realm of video games for several key reasons, combining intricate gameplay, a deeply immersive world, and a gripping narrative. It elevates itself above many others by offering a distinctive and challenging experience that rewards perseverance, skill, and mastery.\n\n1. Combat System\nThe combat system in Sekiro is unlike anything in other games. Its focus on timing, parries, and posture rather than pure health depletion creates a fast-paced, rhythm-like combat experience. Every enemy encounter feels like a duel of skill, where players must learn their opponent's movements and react with precision. This is especially true for boss battles, which test every skill players have developed. It's intense and rewarding, making victory feel incredibly earned.\n\n2. Stealth and Exploration\nUnlike the Dark Souls or Bloodborne titles that FromSoftware is known for, Sekiro introduces a stealth element that offers a new dimension of gameplay. The ability to sneak up on enemies, take them out silently, or bypass entire groups of foes adds strategic depth. Exploration is also rewarding, with hidden items, NPCs, and lore tucked away in nooks and crannies of the beautifully realized environments.\n\n3. Challenging Yet Fair\nThe game’s difficulty is notorious, but unlike some other games where high difficulty can feel cheap, Sekiro ensures that every death is a lesson. Whether it's learning the right posture-breaking move or understanding enemy attack patterns, the game pushes you to improve. It creates an experience where you get better not because your character levels up, but because you become more skilled.\n\n4. World and Story\nSekiro takes place in a beautifully crafted, fantastical version of Sengoku-period Japan. The setting feels rich and alive, blending myth with history, filled with mystical creatures, towering castles, and serene temples. The minimalist approach to storytelling, typical of FromSoftware games, is also present but fits perfectly here. Players are drawn into the narrative through environmental storytelling, cryptic dialogue, and cutscenes that reveal the underlying depth of the world.\n\n5. Freedom in Playstyle\nWhile Sekiro has a linear story, it offers freedom in how you approach the challenges. Whether you prefer going head-on into a fight or utilizing stealth and gadgets from your prosthetic arm, the game encourages experimentation. The variety of tools at your disposal—from shurikens and flame-throwers to an umbrella shield—adds layers of strategy, making each encounter feel fresh.\n\n6. Immersive Atmosphere\nThe atmosphere in Sekiro is one of solitude, danger, and mystery. The music enhances this, with its hauntingly beautiful traditional Japanese themes and intense battle music. The visual design, from snow-covered mountains to eerie, otherworldly temples, pulls you into a world that is both brutal and captivating.\n\n7. A Different Kind of Hero\nSekiro, the protagonist, is a more defined character compared to the silent protagonists of the Dark Souls series. His personal journey, loyalty to his master, and quest for redemption give players a more personal stake in the story. This narrative focus makes Sekiro feel unique within FromSoftware’s catalog.\n\n8. Replayability and Mastery\nWhat makes Sekiro the best isn’t just the challenge but the mastery of the game that becomes possible with practice. Even after finishing the game, players will want to return to refine their skills, tackle boss fights with more finesse, or discover hidden paths and alternate endings.\n\nIn conclusion, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the best video game for those seeking a thrilling, deeply rewarding challenge. Its innovation in combat, its immersive world, and its focus on player growth make it a game that leaves a lasting impact. It pushes the boundaries of what a video game can offer in terms of depth, emotion, and satisfaction, securing its place as a modern classic. plus owen sucks dick (he doesn't like it)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "review": "No, I don't recommend this game. \n\nThere's idiosyncrasies innate to souls games that I can overlook, but they're ramped up here beyond the point of tolerance. It seems that whenever presented with a design choice, the developers defaulted to the route that made the game less fun to play. \n\nI'll use the phantom enemies as an example. These enemies take 20% damage unless you're using a specific \"buff\" item. This buff item lasts a minute, and isn't replaced if you die during the fight. Other FS games have these buff items as well, but they actually buff your damage, not just return it to normal. It just feels unnecessary to have it like this.\n\nAnother huge criticism I have is the lack of animation canceling; if you've clicked a button, you're locked in until it resolves. This disincentivizes an aggressive approach, as you're not allowed to defend if a boss throws an attack you weren't expecting. It turns what should be an action game into a memory exercise. You've always had to memorize boss patterns for attack windows in FS games, but it's so unbelievably egregious in Sekiro it's plainly unforgivable. \n\nThe lack of fine control over dodging is another annoying issue.\n\nThese issues don't get better throughout the game. I didn't feel a sense of pride and accomplishment on beating the final boss, just a sense of relief that it was finally over.",

There are a few more subtleties but that really is the core of the fighting system. You just gotta get into that rhythm.\n\nFrom then on, the game was so much fun. The thrilling fights, the dark Japanese fantasy universe, the stellar art direction and the sheer fun of exploring all of it grabbed me and never really let me go.\nI mean, I haven't played that game in almost a year and it just randomly popped up in my mind (again) and I felt compelled to finally write a review about it. Time to replay it I guess...\n\nSuch a fantastic game.",

        "review": "Monumetal game. The final boss is absolutely remarkable. The combat is simple and forces you to play one way with deflecting, which I loved. It is the best combat system in any game, hands down, making the game so EASY (very hard), yet enjoyable and thrilling.\n\nPersonally, I clicked so well with the deflecting mechanic that I defeated Isshin Ashina, the Sword Saint, on my third try during my first playthrough (an absolute gamer flex—I am the better gamer!). I was able to do this because of how much I learned throughout the game, and seeing my improvement made it all the more special. Yet even though Isshin took me three attempts, the Demon of Hatred made up for it with like 20.\n\nWith this game, you can’t just make a build that can one-shot every boss, like in other Soulsborne games (not dissing those; they are masterpieces in their own ways). To actually beat a boss in this game, you need to get better and learn from your mistakes, giving it a je ne sais quoi that no other game can touch. Overall, a masterpiece.\n\nIf I were to critique it in any way, it can be hard to get places with no map, and the grappling mechanics can sometimes be unfair, reaching you even from across the map. But these are only small critiques in an ocean of goodness.\n\nI’ve made some (like 4) game reviews on other praised games, but this is my most serious one, so take this as if it is an objective statement of fact. Pointing you towards the Add to Cart button—you will not regret it (only after finishing the game; during the game, you will yell at it, regret it, get mad, and cry. DIE TWICE MY BUTT).\n\nMasterpiece of a game—100/10!",

Some time ago I had 2 weeks off work and decided to give it another try and oh dude... It turned out I was fucking wrong all along. This game has become one of my all time favourite once I progressed and managed to slap some bosses after it finally started to click with me. Most of all, this game is actually so much  fun and I have not been this engaged in a game in a very long time. The combat in this game is  some kind of masterpiece.",

I screamed when i beat the game, i Screamed when i beat almost every boss (some weren't that hard) but some just felt like 1000 Malekiths from elden ring. i would honestly recommend this game to anyone who wants to be stuck on a boss for anywhere between 1-10 hours 10/10",

I loved this one as well when it first came out, but recently returned to get all achievements and experience the great mods it has. (Resurrection is amazing. Working on Lmtsr next). This is so well made. So tight and focused on what it wants to be. Hands down my favorite From Soft game and I never thought I would put anything above Ds1. If you are looking at this review just buy it. It is worth the time it takes to get used to the combat and before you know it, you may be looking forward to a charmless, bell NG+6 run. Good luck.",

The game does not do the best job of easing one into its fighting system. So I gave up on the game early on.\nWhat made me come around, and what I would suggest to other people who feel similar, is playing Lies of P. \n\nLies of P has a similar combat style but features a more friendly difficulty curve and a level system that offers more leeway. After beating Lies of P, I returned to Sekiro and the game suddenly made way more sense and turned into a nice experience. \n\nIt simply takes a certain amount of time and effort to reach the point where Sekiro reveals itself to be an enjoyable, satisfying, and mostly well-designed game. However, I also understand why some people give up on the game before they reach that point.",

Also getting easy access to spirit emblems and gold so you can actually use them alot, but the game is extremely punishing at the start, unfairly is a few ways IMO. \n\nThe dragonrot debuff is just a punishment for worse players which seems pointless. You're already dying, and 70% of the time you're losing gold and skill points. Also, a few early bosses require items to make them easier/even doable. Butterfly woman, and spirit monk. If you die on them more than a few times, you're gonna have to farm for gold or the item, which is just unfun.\n\nBut, if you get past the growing pains it can be rewarding when you beat the challenging bosses. Though some do suck with annoying status effects, there are more hits than misses. If you get the game good luck on the final boss.",

Different from other souls games, you're almost required to learn attack patterns and parry instead of rolling, or you won't make any progress. Combat is hard to learn, even harder to master. Probably the hardest game I've ever completed fully. 9/10, my only gripe would be the tedious grinding of enemies you have to do if you want to acquire skill points in late game, amazing game though. Would recommend to anyone who wants a good challenge.",

        "review": "I simultaneously love and hate this game to an extreme degree.\n\nIf a game presents me with the opportunity to perfect parry an attack, you bet I'm doing so whenever I can, so a game like Sekiro sounded like the dream for me since the vast majority of attacks can be deflected.\n\nEarlygame is easily the most frustrating period of the game and arguably at its hardest when you don't have the fundamentals fully grasped, you have very little health where a sneeze from most enemies will kill you outright, and not a lot of healing options.\n\nOver my first playthrough, I have been repeatedly sent back to the sculptor's idol even from a few seemingly unbeatable minibosses more times than I could count. But once I understood the combat flow and started to recognize an enemy's moveset, the game has the most satisfying combat out of any FromSoft game I've played. As of the time of writing this review, I've already started a New Game+ playthrough attempting all of the possible endings, blowing past enemies & bosses that gave me trouble the first time around.\n\nThere's a few mechanics and encounters that do drag the game down a bit (such as Terror & [spoiler]Blazing Bull & the gank on Headless Guardian Ape's rematch[/spoiler]) but thankfully, they're relatively rare occurrences in a solid enemy lineup.\n\nThere are points in the game where you will encounter a roadblock and think some enemy is downright impossible to beat. Genichiro, the earlygame boss, ended up demolishing me more times than even the final boss while I was just starting to understand the game's basics. Sekiro is undoubtedly a difficult game, but nothing is truly insurmountable.\n\nGiving up is the true death. Hesitation is defeat.",

The story line I felt the went a little fast, I was done much sooner than I thought it would take originally. While it was a good  game, for me it is not worth a second play.

        "review": "From Software's best game of recent years, a tightly designed action game with combat that tests your ability to react to enemy attack patterns like in other recent From games, but actually does it well thanks to having the deflection mechanic, shinobi tools (Special weapons), a jump that isn't just for dodging, and the posture system, which combine to encourage being aggressive while being able to swap into defense when necessary, creating a back and forth to the combat that plays like a simple rhythm game sometimes, just with swords and shurikens, instead of guitars and drums.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the game is similar to From's pre-Elden Ring world design, with tightly designed areas between idols (Bonfires), with many, many, bosses and minibosses to kill, items to pick up, shinobi tools to find and so on. Just with a bit more platforming due to the aforementioned jump button and other methods of traversal.\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of issues I do have, though they're mostly minor. You lose half your cash and exp to the next skill point on death, with a 30% chance to randomly keep them. Except if you die, you can progress another, easily dealt with, mechanic that reduces that chance. Both feel pointless and shoehorned in, and honestly I'm largely tired of the \"Drop all your stuff in place on death.\" mechanic in games.\r\nAs is tradition for From Soft, getting to the 'true' ending is somewhat obtuse, though I will say that outside of a couple of them, the quests are largely linear and easy enough to find and progress, with obvious points in the game that will cause them to break completely.\r\nOn top of that, there's a couple bosses that just suck, but they're heavily outshone by this game having some of From Soft's best bosses, with the final one being my absolute fave across their entire catalogue.\r\nAlso Terror exists, is an insta-death status effect, and sucks in all situations it appears, so yeah, that's a thing.\r\n\r\nOverall, easy recommendation for my favourite From Soft game.",

        "review": "Its is a fantastic game, with a lot of flaws. The good is that is boss battles are peak, the final boss is my favorite boss battle out of any game. The graphical design (not graphics) is amazing, the colors are vibrant and very pleasing. The story is pretty good, but not anything special. I wasn't fully engaged with it, but I understood what was happening at all times. \r\n\r\nI know people are going to hate me for this, but I would say this game is one of the weaker games by FromSoft. While the combat was super enjoyable during boss battles, the level design (NOT WORLD DESIGN) is the worst level design in souls games besides Dark Souls II. The combat was built for one on one battles, and most of the time you will get swarmed with enemies and killing them through stealth does not give me any satisfaction. The game simply does not give you the tools to kill multiple enemies at once (Well it does a little if you use all of your spirit emblems). Also, I never felt like I was missing out when I did not kill the enemies. Rarely they would give me anything useful, and the money feels useless. Also the fact that you have to press \"Rest\" at bonfires when you don't have to in any other souls game annoys me, as does that I have to press a button to receive money from fallen foes. \r\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and I still refight the bosses once in a while, this game has issues that I think are overlooked simply because the game gives you such a good farewell note with the final boss battle. If you like the original Dark Souls as your favorite souls game, then be cautious about buying this game, because it is the very opposite of Dark Souls.",

        "review": "I'm kind of shocked that I was able to beat this game. I bought this 4 years ago and tried to play it about once a year. Each time I would play for slightly longer. 30 minutes, an hour and each time just not understanding the very fundamentals of the gameplay. This time however, I absolutely crushed the game! I truly don't know what happened with me, but everything just clicked this time around. I blew through the game, beating most of the bosses in 3-4 attempts. I really was on one for most of the game and loved my experience.\n\nAs with most of the Fromsoft games, the story is interesting and I barely pay attention to it. I did pay attention to this one a bit more because the cutscenes were interesting and the story is a bit more direct. Working to severe the threads of immortality is dope! Playing with shinobi codes and loyalty is also interesting. Overall, the story added great urgency to the game and really made me want to see what and where it would take me.\n\nThe environments in the game are all stunning and some of the best in the fromsoft catalog of games. The change to a more linear and shorter experience really made for areas that felt so layered with secrets and encounters that felt very natural. The way the world is structured is really perfect.\n\nNow the gameplay, oh boy this shit slaps! The main event in this game are the bosses and mini bosses. It's really more of a rythym game than a traditional fromsoft affair. Its all about timing, blocking, and staying patient. This is what evaded me for so many years, I kept trying to dodge out of the way of every attack. Staying still and blocking/parrying is terrifying at first. It's the exact opposite of what I'm just to from Dark Souls and that's the approach I was trying to take into this game. That mentality is just completely wrong and when I finally realized that the game became so much fun. Almost every boss is fun and all have their own challenges that are amazing to overcome. From giant monkeys to small monkeys it's all good. Where the combat does fail is when there are more than one enemy is attacking you. The combat system is really not suited to multiple attackers and feels incredibly unfair (the seven spears boss at the very end of the game with the General type enemy being the absolute worst offender and I'm not sure anyone did it without cheesing one of the enemies. I'm not proud that I did but I can't see any other way of doing that fight). At least there aren't many fights that are like this and most situations with multiple foes can be avoided by stealthing. The stealth is pretty alright. It works and isn't too frustrating so it doesn't hinder the game with it's inclusion. Being able to sneak through an area is fairly fun and is pretty immersive to being a shinobi. The main problem with it is that it's way easy to just run past the enemies in the main areas lol.\n\nWill I do the gauntlets, fight all the optional bosses, and do all the endings. Maybe. But did I enjoy this game and replay it some day. Definitely!\n\nHopefully they make a sequel or another game in this vein someday. Maybe I should just play amoured core",

        "review": "Another triumph from From Software, showcasing their remarkable creativity and fresh ideas. Bloodborne was fantastic, and I’m confident Elden Wing will be just as impressive. From Software consistently delivers quality games, making reviews unnecessary—every title is worth playing.\n\nThough it might seem like just another Souls-like game, it’s actually quite unique. The combat stands out, rewarding precise reactions and timing. Mastering parries, dodges, and counters is crucial, especially in human duels. The story is more straightforward this time, which suits the game well.\n\nSome say it’s too hard, but improvement comes from mastering the game’s systems, not grinding for levels. Like with Dark Souls, you need to learn and respect the game’s mechanics to succeed.\n\nThe streamlined gameplay allows for finely-tuned combat, making it the sharpest From Software has created. This is, arguably, the best combat system in any action RPG. Executing a flawless series of blocks, parries, and counters is incredibly satisfying.\n\nMiyazaki once again delivers with superb world and enemy design. The game is not only mechanically sound but also rich in heart, featuring diverse and beautiful locations that offer one of the most captivating takes on feudal Japan. Enemies vary from peasants and samurai to supernatural beings, adding depth and intrigue.",

The main thing I loved in this game is the combat system, unlike any other souls/soulslike, parry is the main way you avoid attacks in this and I honestly love it more than the traditional rolling to dodge. The fights in this are also mostly pure sword skill and once you learn to parry every move an enemy/boss will throw at you and you deliver the final blow, you really feel like you earned the win and you feel great afterwards. Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a new single player to pick up, be warned though, the game is very tough, Good luck!!",

Originally, I wasn't into this game on release and that's because I was stubborn and tried to play the game in a way that it wasn't designed for. I tried again this past year and grew to truly enjoy it. Beating the boss that filtered me years ago and then finally slicing open the neck of the final boss after countless attempts filled me with a sense of accomplishment from a game that I haven't felt in a while. The game gives you tons of tools to augment your play while also being perfectly beatable with nothing more than a single katana. This game will make you learn fights, it will make you play to its tune, and when you take part in the dance of combat, it's beautiful. Give it a go.",

        "review": "Sekiro is an awesome game. It's challenging, more challenging that any of the Dark Souls games in my opinion. The fact that you have to add parry/block actions to the gameplay really makes the game unique and rewarding after completion. \n\nWhy negative review then? \n\nWell, for a game that costs 60$, especially from From Software, and ESPECIALLY in GOTY version, you would expect the things to be perfrct. One thing isn't perfect, in fact, it's not working at all - I'm speaking about the controller. Something in this game is preventing from \"normal\" use of a Xbox controller. \"Normal\" meaning - you just plug it, like in any other souls like game and you play, no questions asked. In Sekiro, I had to spend around 5 hours fixing my controller sh*t, searching on Reddit or other forums for a solution. We all know Sekiro has an issue with controller detection, setting THE controller which you are using to be your primary one. In all of those 5 hours I didn't find the solution, I've actually had to develop one for myself. Forum posts helped me find clues but in the end I HAD TO install EXTERNAL software, written by REGULAR people (not devs, like it should have been done). Only after that I was able to play, only after 5 hours of searching and testing.\n\nTo me it's unacceptable that a 60$ game of such prestige has this kind of basic problems, unsolved for 5 years so far. So if you are intrested how I'd fix it, check out my guides for a solution.\n\nOther than that, like I said, game is a masterpiece itself. Fights are challenging, even the very basic ones. Maybe you are just a little bit tired with Xbox controller since you have to basically use parry (LT) all the time, and with your finger being a little bit up on your left stick (L) makes it uncomfortable after a few hours but w/e. \n\nI didn't like some of the boss fights, which basically required some of the Schinobi tools to use. You could do those fights without the tools but it was a pain. Also the fact that you had to tweak your consumables with your right hand on the D-pad made the fights frustrating sometimes.\n\nAll in all, very challenging game - to me the most difficult FromSoftware game so far. It was a great learning experience and awesome joy after each boss beaten.",

        "review": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice... As much as I'd love to give this a good review. I Myself cannot, unfortunately because It's not my type of flow. It is different for sure, and I am sure a lot of people will enjoy this game. For it's story and Background. I myself though just cannot bring myself to gear on in and grind Sekiro. I have gotten a bit further than before, when I first played Sekiro, finally passing the first boss I've encountered. After which, I had no clue as to where to go, how the items are used, or how certain tools, and key items are used for. There isn't much explanation in Sekiro unlike Dark Souls Trilogy. Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 all had amazing story, weapon, gear, and stat atonement. Key Items made sense, and was understandable.\n\nHope this review is somewhat good. My overall rating out of 5 is.\n4/5.\n\nI'm just bad at the game I guess, but still fun give it a go! Try it out for yourself!~",

        "review": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is not just a game; it's a test of skill, patience, and perseverance that stands out as one of the most thrilling experiences I’ve had in gaming. From the very moment I stepped into the shoes of the Wolf, I was captivated by the world, the story, and most of all, the combat—a symphony of steel, where katana blades clash with a precision that’s both beautiful and deadly. If you’re someone who finds joy in the intensity of one-on-one duels, where each swing and parry could mean the difference between life and death, then Sekiro is a game you simply cannot miss.\n\nThe combat in Sekiro is its crowning jewel. It’s a system that demands more from the player than just timing and quick reflexes; it requires a deep understanding of your enemy’s movements, a careful observation of their patterns, and the nerve to stand your ground as attacks rain down on you. The feeling of two blades meeting in mid-air, the clash that echoes through the battlefield, and the brief pause before the next strike—it’s all so incredibly immersive that you’ll find yourself lost in the flow of combat. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of perfectly timing a parry, watching your enemy stagger, and then delivering that final, devastating blow.\n\nFor me, the journey through Sekiro was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I’ve ever had. In just over 20 hours, I conquered this beast of a game, but not without being fully immersed in every moment. The world of Sekiro is as unforgiving as it is beautiful, with each area teeming with dangers that will test your resolve. The sense of accomplishment I felt after each boss battle, after every seemingly insurmountable obstacle, was unparalleled. It’s a game that constantly challenges you, but it also gives you the tools to overcome those challenges. The mechanics are so finely tuned that, even when you’re struggling, you can see the path to victory—you just have to muster the will to walk it.\n\nComparing Sekiro to Elden Ring, which was my first foray into FromSoftware’s brutal yet captivating world, it’s clear that Sekiro is a different beast altogether. While Elden Ring offered a sprawling world filled with exploration and discovery, Sekiro hones in on the art of combat. It’s more focused, more intense, and yes—more difficult. The challenge in Sekiro is not just in surviving; it’s in mastering the art of the sword. Every enemy encounter is a puzzle to be solved, every boss fight a mountain to be climbed. And when you finally reach the summit, the view is spectacular.\n\nI can’t wait to embark on New Game Plus and start the journey toward unlocking every achievement, much like I did with Elden Ring. There’s something about Sekiro that draws you back in, even after the credits have rolled. Maybe it’s the allure of becoming even more skilled, of pushing yourself to new heights, or maybe it’s just the sheer joy of combat that keeps calling me back. Whatever it is, I know that Sekiro will be a game I return to time and time again.\n\nBut make no mistake—this game is hard. There will be moments when you feel overwhelmed, when the odds seem insurmountable. But in those moments, I urge you to remember why you started this journey in the first place. Sekiro rewards those who persevere, who take the time to learn, adapt, and overcome. And when you finally triumph, the satisfaction is like nothing else.\n\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is more than deserving of its Game of the Year title. It’s a masterclass in game design, in creating a combat system that is as deep as it is rewarding. For anyone who loves a true challenge, who revels in the thrill of the fight, this is a must-play. So pick up your sword, steel your nerves, and step into the world of Sekiro. You won’t regret it.",

        "review": "I bought this in 2020 and after beating the guardian ape, I took a 4 year break for some odd reason. But then I decided to beat some games I had lying around my steam library. I beat Dark Souls 2 and loved it. Then I went to sekiro and started a new file. After a few hours I finally beat the game 2 times and I can now officially say that this game is awesome. People say it's \"the hardest souls game\" but it really isn't. Sure it doesn't have i-frames and there are a few annoying input and camera issues, but that doesn't mean shit compared to the world and boss quality. Never have I ever died to a boss and took notes in my head to how I can improve. Learning the parry system is more fun than I've ever had in any video games (maybe a bit dramatic but it's still sort of true). The story is also really good and I can actually understand what's going on instead of having to watch Vaatividya for 5 hours. \r\n\r\nMy only real issues are a few input delays that I had to get used to and some bosses just being stupid (most of them are optional and re-used bosses). I get that a lot of people like the chained ogre but why the fuck are grab attacks doing in a game with no i-frames? It mixes the fight a bit up which can be fun if it didn't one-shot me most of the time. The same with fire attacks too sort of. It can be interesting to have to dodge attacks instead of parrying them, the speed of wolf definitely makes it a better experience, but sometimes it's just a new gimmick thrown at you without any guide on how to counter it. For Demon of hatred, I learned that I should just run behind him until his health reaches zero or posture is broken FOR THREE PHASES. Pretty boring but not a bad fight overall.\r\n\r\nI love this game and pray that the remaining 70% of players can beat it.",

The camera always points so that you can't see anything, the game tries it's hardest to make you fall asleep with walls of text instead of show don't tell, the lack of support for PS-style prompts is inexcusable, the lack of explanation of game mechanics DESPITE the walls of text, the insanely long travel times put you to sleep before anything fun happens.. \n\nI've heard time and time again how this game is great, and fair enough, if you can look past the poor UX, I can see the actual gameplay being fun, the problem is the gameplay is about 5% of your actual playtime, the rest is reading, traveling, CONSTANTLY resetting the camera so you can actually see anything, having to figure out the controls and mechanics that the game doesn't tell you about etc. Can't really speak to the graphical aspect of the game since the game never lets you see anything past the 2 pebbles next to your toes. It's just sad that a supposedly reputable company is putting out basically an Alpha version for 60 bucks with no promise of fixing it.",

The bosses, the setpieces, the world-design and the story mix into a wonderful stew that only thickens and enriches the more you sip.  \n\nFor me . . . Elden Ring, also a masterpiece, was too massive and repeated too many bosses to truly capture me. Dark Souls 1 was too jank to be entirely enjoyable. Dark Souls 3 is close to perfect too; but I just enjoy Sekiro on another level. The game expects you to die, a lot, just like any Souls-like game. But from that expectation comes the thrill of victory. The feeling of power and confidence once you do master the gameplay. With practice and diligence; and many attempts watching the same boss entrance cutscenes on repeat; eventually you too will become the ultimate death dealing God of vengeance. Or maybe, become consumed by bloodlust. And finally, once you've reached the pinnacle of your power, it throws you against the first boss of the game as a prelude to it's final boss; and you slay him easily and without much ado; only to face your final challenge. \n\nWonderful. \n\n",

I know this game it very difficult to everyone but it can be easy way to play this game is practice yourself and learn combo by yourself. This is another souls game that I consider to be the best game of formsoftware because I love a Japanese and I like samurai This game is a game that captures the details well. Both the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay system is good. As for the story, I love the story of this game the most. If you didn’t have this game you should buy it I’m guarantee you will enjoy it.",

        "review": "I started this game a while ago, and even being a hardcore FromSoft glazer like I am, I thought that this game just wasn't for me. I had not put in the time to give the combat a chance, and never stopped to explore the world of this game. I was stubborn, and I was firmly rooted in my ways from other souls-likes of running through areas and not stopping to explore or to take out enemies, of using a giant hunk of metal I could barely even call a sword to brute-force my way through the games. I never blocked, I never parried, I never used spells, And I never used buffs. Besides, it was basically a Dark Souls dex build so what could I have been missing out on anyways. It was not my smartest move ever by far.\n\nAfter not playing this game for quite a long time, and playing other games with my friends, I decided that i should come back to this game. I figured I should give it another chance, after all people say it's one of FromSoftware's best games, and I never hated it when i played it, besides it cant hurt to give it another chance. And the experience was pretty good when I started it back up. I don't know when it happened but at some point in my play-through this game grabbed me, I don't know if it was the voice acting and writing, or the masterfully crafted level design, or the combat which I know consider to be the best in all of gaming, but something got me hooked. I was so into this game i wouldn't stop playing it. Every free second was time to play Sekiro, every day I woke up there was a new boss to beat. I was hooked, in a way I had never been on a game before.\n\nIt has been 7 days since I beat this game, seven days of an empty feeling that simply expresses how nothing will ever measure up to the quality of this game. No matter how many of the \"Best games of all time\" I play, nothing will ever measure up. nothing will ever capture me in the same way that this game did. Don't get me wrong, I will always love the souls games as the games that changed my life, and I will always remember those classic Nintendo DS games which shaped my childhood, but something here, something feels different. not simply good because of how fondly I remember it and the console it was on, its not good because it was a stepping stone to something greater, but because of something that I believe cannot be named. The absolute masterpiece that this game is, is something which cannot be put into words and can only be understood once you watch those end credits roll, and look back on the days, weeks, even months, spent in this game. If you are a fan of the souls genre, or even of video games as a whole, play it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are you doing reading this still? go play it.",

But fear not—each death is just a stepping stone to becoming the shinobi god you were always meant to be.\n\nThe combat is so tight and satisfying, you’ll start parrying your morning coffee spills and trying to Mikiri Counter your cat's sudden pounces. And when you finally take down that boss who’s been turning you into digital sushi for hours, the victory dance you’ll do would make even the most disciplined samurai proud.\n\nIn short, \"Sekiro\" is the ultimate test of skill, patience, and your ability to laugh at your own relentless demise. It’s the most fun you’ll ever have getting repeatedly pummeled by a giant, immortal ape.\n\n10/10 would die again!",

I had some struggles along the way with some bosses. Skill issue? Nah. Everybody can beat the game, if they have determination to do so. My favorite boss in the game is the final boss (not gonna spoil). Why? stunning visuals. I was amazed by it when i first saw it. And my hated, least favorite boss is the lady with kunais. I died like 50 times to her.  Dont ever say \"Sona tana do mada mada kuiniyo\" in front of me. I have some issues with this sentence.",

Where 300gb of your storage isn't sacrificed in order to experience such a story rich, graphically beautiful, and satisfying combat game. It's definitely a tough game, but worth the play through. My only issue is there is a lacklustre of bosses, but contradicted by the awesome, wide spectre of bosses you do encounter. \n\nIn Sekiro, you cant use summons, you can't change your build to combat and counter different bosses, and you can't use OP weapons or spells. All you have is your one katana, a handful of items, and whole lotta skill. That's what makes Sekiro so special. It's definitely the hardest souls game, but at the same time, it's fair, interesting and satisfying. The whole game is a pure skill check, and if you mastered Sekiro, then the other souls games shouldn't be too rough of an experience\n\n9.5/10\n\n",

Then you start winning, finding strategies, and get through it.  The feeling of accomplishment is something I haven't felt since the first DS.  I love this game, and can't recommend it enough.

I enjoyed my time with the game but I would not have missed much not playing it either.\n\n I find the story telling and and visual aesthetics quite weak. The colour palette is bland and everything is greyed down. \n\nWhen it comes to combat I find the actual bossfights to be quite fun, more so than other fromsoft titles. The sneaking aspect of the game is enjoyable and the map design is good but fighting many enemies at once is rarely fun and mostly frustrating. The parry system is easy to grasp and fun to master. There is very little grind and the bosses are very challenging but fair at the same time.",

        "review": "This game is amazing, just like every other souls game out there to date. I recommend it to those who enjoy a challenge and learning the games mechanics as these games require that you at least are competent. Not only that but these games have an amazing story that can easily steal your life away. Generally in modern gaming industry it's hard to find good crafted games, and while these game are not prefect, are are damn close! \r\n\r\nHowever if you are expecting the same treatment as the other souls game this one is very different, the combat got a whole rework, focusing around parring, deflecting and guarding. The game can be completed without using this new mechanics though i won't recommend that, as learning the timing of bosses is hard yes but not as hard as people used to say it was cause they just came out of DS3 are used to rolling everything. And within this game, it has tons a ways to express yourself in combat but unfortunately not in it's RPG mechanics. As the game is much more story heavy then most before it, your character is Wolf a Shinobi and the story it tell with your character along the way through Ashina. It's a story i won't miss and gamplay is so addicting once learned or even mastered!\r\n\r\n\r\n---{ Graphics }---\r\n☐ You forget what reality is\r\n☑ Beautiful\r\n☐ Good\r\n☐ Decent\r\n☐ Bad\r\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\r\n☐ MS-DOS\r\n\r\n---{ Gameplay }---\r\n☑ Sekiro\r\n☐ Very good\r\n☐ Good\r\n☐ It's just gameplay\r\n☐ Mehh\r\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\r\n☐ Just don't\r\n\r\n---{ Audio and Music }---\r\n☑ Eargasm\r\n☐ Very good\r\n☐ Good\r\n☐ Not too bad\r\n☐ Bad\r\n☐ I'm now deaf\r\n\r\n---{ Audience }---\r\n☐ Kids\r\n☐ Teens\r\n☐ Adults\r\n☐ Grandma\r\n☑ Anyone and Everyone\r\n\r\n---{ Difficulty }---\r\n☐ Just press 'W'\r\n☐ Easy\r\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\r\n☐ Significant brain usage\r\n☐ Difficult\r\n☑ Sekrio\r\n\r\n---{ Grind }---\r\n☐ Nothing to grind\r\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks/achievements\r\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\r\n☐ Average grind level\r\n☐ Too much grind\r\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\r\n\r\n---{ Story }---\r\n☐ No Story\r\n☐ Some lore\r\n☐ Average\r\n☐ Good\r\n☐ Lovely\r\n☑ It'll replace your life\r\n\r\n---{ Game Time }---\r\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\r\n☐ Short\r\n☐ Average\r\n☑ Long\r\n☐ To infinity and beyond\r\n\r\n---{ Price }---\r\n☐ It's free!\r\n☑ Worth the price\r\n☐ If it's on sale\r\n☐ If u have some spare money left\r\n☐ Not recommended\r\n☐ You could also just burn your money\r\n\r\n---{ Bugs }---\r\n☑ Never heard of\r\n☐ Minor bugs\r\n☐ Can get annoying\r\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\r\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\r\n\r\n---{ ? / 10 }---\r\n☐ 1\r\n☐ 2\r\n☐ 3\r\n☐ 4\r\n☐ 5\r\n☐ 6\r\n☐ 7\r\n☐ 8\r\n☐ 9\r\n☑ 10\r\n",

Like other FromSoft souls games, this game extremely difficult, however, that's mostly due to its unique combat and progression systems. The way in which you navigate the world is also quite different. It will take time to get used to, but once grasped the game becomes extremely fun. The story is much easier to understand and follow than other FromSoft souls games and also comes with a beautiful old Japanese setting. This game is tough, but is an extraordinary experience both during and after the learning curve should you be willing to take up the challenge.",

        "review": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - A Disappointing Departure from FromSoftware's Mastery\r\n\r\nAs a die-hard fan of FromSoftware's previous titles I've found myself fighting boss after boss, learning and loving the experience. I've immersed myself in the rich, interconnected worlds that the studio is known for. However, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice stands as a stark departure from what I've come to love about their games. Despite its critical acclaim, I found it to be a frustrating and unengaging experience.\r\n\r\nCombat: More Tedious Than Challenging\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest disappointments in Sekiro is its combat. While FromSoftware games are known for their challenging yet rewarding combat systems, Sekiro’s mechanics felt both stale and monotonous. The game demands precision, but the execution often boils down to spamming the light attack button for extended periods, waiting for the boss to counter so you can engage in the repetitive cycle of attack and deflect. This pattern, rather than feeling strategic, became mind-numbing.\r\n\r\nAdding to this, many bosses in Sekiro tend to retreat during fights, which resets their posture bar, undoing much of the progress you've painstakingly made. Chasing them down doesn't always work effectively, and it breaks the flow of combat, turning what should be an intense duel into a tedious game of tag.\r\n\r\nA World That Fails to Inspire\r\n\r\nSekiro's world is undeniably beautiful, with a strong aesthetic rooted in Japanese history and mythology. Yet, despite its visual appeal, the map felt bland and uninspired in its design. The sense of discovery and wonder that defines FromSoftware’s other games is sorely lacking here. Instead of eagerly exploring the world, I found myself moving from one area to the next out of obligation rather than curiosity.\r\n\r\nExploration is further dampened by the game's loot system. Like in other FromSoft games, most items you find are underwhelming or downright useless. However, unlike those games, Sekiro's streamlined progression system makes these items feel even less impactful. The few valuable items are often hidden behind illogical or obscure mechanics, leaving little reason to thoroughly explore the world.\r\n\r\nA Mind-Numbing Grind\r\n\r\nThe most damning issue for me was how the game managed to turn challenging encounters into a grind. In previous FromSoftware titles, every death felt like a learning experience, a step closer to mastery. In Sekiro, however, I found myself zoning out during boss fights, mindlessly repeating the same actions until I finally won. The sense of achievement that usually accompanies victory in these games was replaced by a feeling of relief that the ordeal was over, followed quickly by dread at the thought of the next inevitable boss.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nSekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a game that simply doesn’t resonate with me, despite my deep appreciation for FromSoftware's other titles. The combat, while difficult, lacks the depth and satisfaction of their previous systems. The world, though beautiful, fails to invite exploration. And the overall experience, instead of being engaging and rewarding, felt like a tedious grind. While I respect the craftsmanship that went into Sekiro, it’s a game I found more frustrating than fun—a rare miss from a developer that usually sets the standard for excellence.",

The combat feels more engaging as you are always interacting with the enemy directly instead of dodging most attacks. I did bounce off of this game initially, but after a bunch of failed fights, it finally clicked. Once you understand how to play this game, the combat feels unnaturally fluid and fun. Sekiro is a fully complete SoulsBorne experience, although it has a hard initial learning curve, it's worth every minute of the process",

        "review": "This game is one of my favorite's of all time. It's in my top 5 games of all time. I have never been a dark souls guy. played dark souls 3 and Elden Ring but never beat them due to them honestly being too difficult. But realizing I could grind souls in those games and come back to those bosses made me understand why people think this game is harder than the rest. This game requires you to master the craft of the blade, the whole game is a training ground for the last couple boss fights. in dark souls titles I never felt like I owned a boss or felt that accomplished afterwards. yeah it feels nice to finally defeat them after endless attempts. But I felt like if I had to do it again I''d probably loose a couple times before I'd beat them once more. In Sekiro I mean man do I feel like a bad ass. I mean the parrying, the dodging, the attacking everything flows within these fights and you feel like you are an actual Shinobi who has trained his whole life to defeat these enemies. Other titles I just feel like a peasant that needs to gather some broken items and get gear that makes me unmatched. But this...... Words cant describe the first feeling you get when it clicks, and honestly when it does the game isn't easy but you start to understand why you lost that fight instead of rolling around until the enemy is open to an attack. Nah I stand toe toe with these dudes and we battle like men. That's the feeling this game gives, that's the feeling I want from a game. Don't waste my time with what build I should go down or where to spec my souls into \"should I build knowledge oh maybe strength. Fuck that give me a sword and watch what I do to this fucking ape. This is just completely different than any other souls game they put out. Not to mention a very easy story to follow. I couldn't tell you wtf happens in dark souls and I've tried to understand it. This game has different pathways different endings. I mean all that on top of one of the best game-plays you can find. This game solely made me want to try Elden ring again and probably gonna try the other souls games afterwards. I know they are nothing like this game. But that's how good this game is. It opened my mind to the other souls like. If you honestly don't like this game its because you were expecting a souls game where you can create a build and cheese bosses or xp farm (*cough, pussy) and then wanted to fight a boss. That's it. What other reason is there. the story is decent enough for a souls game (I think its pretty solid but not the best out there) the game play is pretty flawless (I don't think it gets much better) and visually it hold its own with Elden ring (in my opinion better but I'll let you Elden nerds have it since its open world oooooo). Come play a real game. Sekiro.....Where boys turn into Shinobi's",

It is a very interesting story and very straightforward compared to other Miyazaki games.\n\nPluses:\n- A very interesting story with a few different endings that you are able to get easily (well most of them, true ending is the hardest one)\n- A very dynamic and fun gameplay\n- A lot of tools that can help you in combat\n- A very pretty locations\n- Interesting and challenging bosses\n- Emma :3\n- Very interesting \"boss rush\" mode with unique end game boss with new moveset\n\nMinuses:\n- Demon of Hatred and Guardian Ape with the broken hitboxes (hate those guys)\n- Not very obvious way to get to the true ending. But thats just a typical FromSoftware thing.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time in Medieval Japan with a fantasy elements and I would hope that this story would continue. But knowing Miyazaki that might be an issue.\nOverall 9 Silent Wolf Shoguns out of 10 just because damn Demon of Hatred and Guardian Ape exist.",
