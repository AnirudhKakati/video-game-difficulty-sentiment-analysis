        "review": "Despite my respect for Soulsborne games, I've never invested in beating any of them after regular NG. Armored Core VI, though was rent free in my head until I had not finished all of the endings.\n\nGreat sense of verticality, ridiculously satisfying weapons with fun movesets, rewarding and enjoyable bosses. The other wonderful trait of the game is how everything fits apocalyptic tone of the game: setting, narrative, characters, soundtrack.\n\nIt is reasonable to criticise the game though - its difficult curve seems off. A lot of segments may seem too simple, and some of the bosses in may be brutally hard in comparison. It is fairly easy to find the build, which can break the game. Also I really wish that customisation had more variety for limbs and flexibility for weapons (it is quite sad that there is no option to have dual melee weapon builds).\n\nIf some of those and other aspects were tweaked, it could have been easily a perfect game. Anyway, it is still another gem from 2023. If you haven't beat the game yet, do not put it on the shelf after its first completion, you won't regret it!",

The combat is fluid, So many Quality of Life improvements for the series (healing, Mission checkpoints, Other things!). The customization is still as impressive as ever (though I feel like it could have more parts for the mechs themselves like the other games: more arms, more legs)! I'm not used to FromSoftware's difficulty outside of AC so I found the game to sometimes be hard but it never was unfair.\n\nCan't wait for a DLC or a new game!",

It's a dramatic, grounded, depressive world, where you happen to be a mercenary who got caught up in fire. This game is hard, it requires to think, to combine, to customise and analyse your decisions about choosing parts for your AC. And this is where i spend most of my time - in the garage, changing parts, making configurations. This is what i love in AC games. But also, the story, the emotional part behind it, even if it's not that noticeable for the majority, the atmosphere just hits. \r\n\r\nIt might not be for everyone, it might be a niche game, but i infinitely glad i found that niche, because AC connects with me on a very deep level, however silly it might sound.\r\n\r\nFeed the fire.",

The mech aspect is beautiful enough (which is partially why I cannot wait to play through again, unlock every mech piece and mechsouls drip myself out to the highest degree) but the Music is also amazing.\r\n\r\nWhile I noticed performance issues during one mission within the first third of the game (you assault a massive land-ship of sorts) I had no other performance issues through the entire game.\r\n\r\nLoved it, hated the boss before my final boss due to the cheese factor, otherwise damn was this an amazing video game to play through.

        "review": "[u]The short: I am happy with my purchase. So much that I paid for the game full price, twice.[/u]\n\nArmored Core as a series are the definitive mecha games. They set the standard for robot-themed customization and sorties. The franchise has come a long way from the PlayStation 1 era, and Armored Core 6 (AC6) has been a long time in waiting since the last entry, Armored Core V / Verdict Day on the PS3.\n\nThe series has gone through several reboots in game design, and AC6 is the latest reboot. To provide some perspective, I have played the majority of the Armored Core games, but most notably, I have not played AC4 / For Answer.\n\nAC6 feels like a solid baseline as a new era in the series. That is to say, It almost feels like a proof-of-concept to see how this new design would work. A very good concept, albeit, with some imperfections here and there. The game introduces a few new mechanics, some of which can be particularly divisive, such as Hard Lock-On and Stagger. Hopefully in their next installment, these mechanics can be smoothened out to be a bit less on the controversial side.\n\nOn the other hand, generally speaking, the game feels incredibly smooth to play. When I first powered on the game, I was pleasantly surprised to find that piloting the mech almost felt like trying to drive a new kind of vehicle. It took a little adjustment in the beginning, but quickly became second nature. The movement and performance of your mech depends entirely on how you build it. Variety in this game is incredible. Speaking of variety, even the game's mission and boss designs encourage you to try out different loadouts to make things easier (or more difficult) for yourself.\n\nComparatively to previous AC games, the story in this one seems to be presented in a way that is easier to follow, which I would consider to be a good thing, personally. The characters and voice acting are also incredible, even if you never get to see the people themselves. While I understand that this is likely an intentional means of presenting the story, I still wished that for once we could actually see or interact with some people. There are some missions that have absolutely incredible set pieces as well, which definitely impressed me from time to time.\n\nThis game does have some multiplayer in the form of PvP, but understand that this primarily a single-player focused game. Personally, I was hoping for more of a multiplayer experience, having come from ACV and loving that one, but sorely found it lacking here. By all means, this is not a bad thing if you prefer single-player games, especially since this one has fairly good replay value in the form of New Game +. However, if you are a multi-player gamer like myself, for the most part, you won't find it here.\n\n[u]The Negatives:[/u]\n- Lacking multiplayer. At launch, you had to manually enter player rooms. The game didn't even have PvP matchmaking 'till it was patched in later. No co-op.\n- Questionable weapon balance. You could say that this is par for the course in From's games, as there will always be one weapon that is better than something else. However, I have seen guns that have single-handedly trivialized the entire game.\n- Missing weapons / parts from previous games. Not having sniper cannons and the like, in favor of the new close-quarters combat stagger system, definitely sucks.\n\n[u]Final Thoughts:[/u]\nThis game feels masterwork in mech design. However, I do feel like this entry is more of a foundation to build upon for Armored Core 7 and beyond. And I certainly hope that is the case, that the next AC game will be even bigger and better, having taken feedback from the new mechanics introduced in this game. I will be eagerly awaiting the next game, and I hope that From Software decides to involve more multiplayer aspects such as co-op, and a more robust PvP environment.",

        "review": "Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a breathtaking return to form for the beloved mech combat franchise, delivering a thrilling blend of deep customization, intense action, and a rich, atmospheric narrative. From the moment you step into your mech, the game immerses you in a dystopian world filled with stunning visuals and intricate details that showcase the sheer scale of both the environments and the towering machines you pilot. The gameplay is an exhilarating mix of fast-paced combat and strategic planning. The controls are tight and responsive, allowing for fluid movement and precise aiming, which is crucial when engaging in the game's challenging missions.\r\n\r\nThe level of customization is astounding—players can tweak every aspect of their mech, from weapons and armor to mobility systems. This depth encourages experimentation, enabling you to find the perfect setup that suits your playstyle. Graphically, Armored Core VI shines. The environments are richly designed, with diverse landscapes ranging from desolate urban ruins to sprawling industrial complexes. The lighting and particle effects during combat are breathtaking, making each skirmish feel dynamic and visceral. Coupled with a hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack and impactful sound design, the overall experience is nothing short of cinematic.",

        "review": "Armored Core 6 promises metal carnage and, if you can beat the boss of the tutorial, it does deliver... just not much more than that. \n\nThe graphics are good enough but nothing to really praise as much of the scenery is a drab grey industrial theme save for maybe two or three zones.\n\nThe difficulty on a majority of missions feels laughably easy with the only exceptions being the bosses and enemy AC pilots. This leads to sudden difficulty spikes because the basic enemies are shredded like their made from paper while anything beyond that leads to either a sudden out of nowhere requirement of skill or an absolute wall of pain requiring several restarts.\n\nContrary to some what some reviews say (looking at you Alex from AngryJoeShow), This game DOES have a story which is delivered through well acted voiceovers about you and your main contact Walter work with and against two main corporations Balam and Arquebuss, fighting against rebels of the Rubicon Liberation Front and each other while making deals with a fourth shady \"junkieyard\" scavenger faction Reuse And Development or RAD, all while an AI Overseer ALLMIND monitors the entire situation. That said, the plot isn't too important for many of the minor missions and could possibly be ignored entirely though paying attention does explain why you are now fighting a giant Gillette Electric Razor snake and everyone is mad at you for ruining their field trip by not bringing the weapon specifically designed for this.\n\nThe gameplay progression is through a Select Mission structure with being forced to occasionally choose one mission over the others. Most missions are relatively simple with destroying all enemies, targeted objects, or collect the occasional MechGuffin all again with the exception of boss missions. Damage is less about raw damage and instead trying to stun your enemies by staggering them with enough damage to dish out bonus damage.\n\nControl-Wise the game feels very fast paced and fluid with mouse and keyboard, the only major issue being when I first got it the hard lock would break the second you moved your move, but it seems that's been remedied with more leeway on mouse movement. Boost kick feels awkward no matter what, but you get used to it.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION: What is a mech game without customization? By progressing through the story, collecting logs and completing battles for ALLMIND, you unlock parts to buy in the shop. The only real downside is how the best mission for grinding money in the game is the previously mentioned overgrown Motorized Shave Worm which is easy as hell if you got the super weapon or two of them, you'll just be doing it a lot.\n\nThe mech parts are almost all part of some set with the exceptions being the specialty legs which can drastically change your movement. You can tell the intended purpose of each set by which company built them, or just by looking at some of them. The sleek jetfighter set by Schnieder is the speedy paper machae, the heavy looking set by Dafeng set has high durability but sluggish. The Balam sets are well rounded but slightly better against munitions. The Arquebuss sets are designed for lasers. so on, so forth. No one full set feels too overpowered compared to the others but there are combinations by mixing sets that absolutely feel that way. \n\nOf the legs you have the standard Bipedal, the high jumping and auto jump-dashing Reverse Joint coming in light, medium and death-kick heavy. The vehicular \"legs\" being a heavy literal pretty-sure-it's-the-highest-armor-value Tank, a lightning fast wheelchair style tread set, and a hovercraft designed for aerial combat. Finally there's the Tetrapod legs in light, medium, and the not-quite-as-tanky-as-literal-tank-but-almost heavy all that have the ability to hover and glide around.\n\nThere are three flavors of weapon damage. Ballistic, Energy/Pulse/Laser/callitwhatever, and explosive, and a whole bunch of why to let your enemies sample each. There are even melee weapons and shields, though both are exclusively right side weapons with the melee being primary and shields being shoulders.\nAt the games release the meta was dual Heavy Shottys, dual Chainguns, and/or Songbird bazookas due to the stunlock meta and rifles felt very underwhelming. Things have changed and while the original meta is still good, it's nowhere near as broken and rifles feel much better to use damage wise though I am personally still not a fan of the slower firerate. Sniper rifles are almost non-existant and instead there are chargeable linear rifles which \"kinda\" are but they don't zoom or scope they just have longer target range. \nYou like missiles? the game has missiles. lots of missiles. You have forward missiles, vertical takeoff missiles, delayed missiles, high yield missiles, laser missiles, 4 shot, 6 shot, 8 shot, ROTARY FIVE SHOT SALVO FOR 15 SHOT MISSILES. You have short missiles long missiles, bazookas, scuds, scatter, and so many more. You like missile? Game got missile.\n\nUltimately the game delivers on mech customization including stuff so detailed like making your own decals I won't bother going into because it's so freeform and customizable.\n\nWould I say the game is worth the price? Eh. It's a very satisfying game, and you can do multiple runs to get different missions, parts, logs, and endings, but once you get all the parts and get all said endings, there isn't really anything left. There's PvP I guess but I've had a 50/50 shot of a stable or laggy connection and despite having a small handfull of good matches it wasn't really my thing.\n\nIf your're a diehard Fromsoft fan or just a hard fan of Armored Core or mech games in general, it's up to you if you want to pay the full price or wait for a discount. For all the casuals I'd say wait for a sale and see if you enjoy it before those two hours are up. Everything moves by fast enough that if you don't have a difficult time with the tutorial helicopter boss you'll get a good sense of whether or not you like it within those two hours. The helicopter is by far the easiest boss and there is no difficulty setting, so if you think it's too hard then you might not like it unless your a masochist.",

PVP isn't perfect but pretty enjoyable to mess around with friends at least. Overall amazing game, best mecha game ever.",

It's not a normal game. Get it. Play it. Beat it. Love it. Understand it. Cry over it. I don't care how. I don't care if you mod it to be easier, just don't miss out of the narrative experience if you have to. Although there is a lot to be said about the difficulty and the simulated life and death struggle feels and experience ... if that's what you need or want it's there to be had and it's masterful game development. \n\nThe game came with an uncanny sense of deja vu and other worldly synchronicity. \nAll on solo player. \nMultiplayer is a cancerous rage fest with next to 0 benefit to me. I don't get it. No co-op was a bummer. That's the only problem.",

I struggled in some of the PvE, but rarely felt like it was impossible, however the game has several mechanics that make playing through it enjoyable and accessible. You can pause, the game has checkpoints, and there's ways to level up your abilities outside of trying over and over again. Compared to other games in the series, it's slower paced, but I haven't actually played them so I can't exactly compare them. Overall, I loved the game and had fun playing through it, even though I prefer more Western styled Mech games.",

The combat in PVE is incredibly fun and PVP rocks pretty hard. My only gripe is that there aren't more campaign missions. If you want a reason to play through all 3 NGs again I highly recommend Rubicon's Inferno or Armoury, pretty nice campaign overhaul mods.",

The first main boss is a challenge and maybe a little buggy, which lead to early frustration. After that and once the parts start rolling in, the game was am absolute blast with a few difficult but very enjoyable boss fights. \n\nIf I finished one of the endings. It's my desire to return to 100% this game after working on some other games in my backlog/wishlist.",

Set on the planet Rubicon, the game lets you pilot towering mechs, engaging in high-stakes battles across stunning, desolate landscapes. The narrative is minimalist but effective, focusing on corporate greed, betrayal, and survival in a war-torn world.\n\nThe heart of the game lies in its combat, which rewards strategic thinking and reflexes. Players can tweak every aspect of their mechs, from weapons to mobility, allowing for endless experimentation. Boss fights are challenging and exhilarating, often pushing you to the edge with their scale and complexity.\n\nWhile the difficulty may feel punishing at times, especially for newcomers, Fires of Rubicon captures the essence of the Armored Core series, offering a rewarding, highly customizable experience for mech enthusiasts and fans of FromSoftware’s challenging games alike.",

I also had a lot of fun making acs and probs spent 50 hours on just making them, testing what works and doesn't. I really like how effective both light and heavy acs are. Both have their pros and cons. Overall theres all sorts of crazy acs you can make if you spend the time and effort learning the intricacies of making one. Multiplayer is kinda eh tho. The lag makes dodging some attacks/builds really hard which is not fun.",

XD.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Armored Core 6 has so many parts, boosters, weapons, and generators are your choices to custom AC build for what you learned from your mistaken to beat this entire game. This is likely for 17+ only. Only the beginners and the expert gamers to take this challenge and have fun to fight against so many missions and ranked up to be the best or having fun with your friends to match-up!!\r\n\r\nDon't forget the first mission was actually tough for beginners without knowing. Flight to the helicopter and slash it as possible with you pulse blade while shooting your rifle and the back-missile. Do your best, rookies!\r\n\r\nOnce again! You're gonna love this game!",

I came to this game as a fan of Fromsoftware and the Dark Souls trilogy. \n\nThere is something so special about this game. the atmosphere, game play, art direction, musical score, and characters all work to completely suck you into this world. Rather than feeling like your just selecting missions from a menu or buying new parts from a list, every UI you interface with feels like it was painstakingly created to immerse you into the life of an independent mercenary here on Rubicon. \n\nI want to dedicate a section here just for this games Music. Every single song that plays while you are out on missions or just in the menu sets the theme perfectly. When it needs to be it is subdued, upbeat, or grand. Kota Hoshino Really outdid himself here. \n\nCustomizing your AC is extremely fun. There are so many different weapons and builds to mess around with. I found myself swapping constantly as I unlocked new things, eager to try out new weapon combos I cooked up. \n\n[b] TLDR [/b] This is an amazing game even if you have never played something like it. I can't give it enough praise. \n\n[b] 10/10 [/b]",

This is also my first experience of any Armored Core game.\r\n\r\nGameplay/Mechanics: 9/10\r\nWhat I've been looking for in the Mecha genre was a game where actions were more deliberate and attacks feel like they have weight to them. The melee weapons definitely fit that role and require proper setup to be most effective. In fact getting the most damage out of any weapon is usually accomplished by first stunning/staggering the enemy through ACS buildup. This stun bar is a new mechanic to the series and not everyone is a fan of it, but I don't see much of an issue with it outside of multiplayer/network lag.\r\nThe movement speed is generally fast paced, but avoiding damage often requires precise timing and is essential to not dying horribly in this game. Certain enemies/bosses are definitely bullet sponges, but having the right loadout can make a big difference in both difficulty and how you play. My only real complaint is related to technical limitations or the game's netcode along with the requirement of a mod to play the campaign mode cooperatively with friends. Certain missions may also contain bugs and performance issues which may occasionally require you to restart the mission.\r\n\r\nDifficulty: Lego Yoda Death Scream/10\r\nThe difficulty is not so much of a curve, but a series of brick walls at certain points in the game. The first one being a heavy attack helicopter designed for the express purpose of systematically removing game journalists from the gene pool along with my sanity. To be fair this is debatably the 3rd or 4th hardest boss in the game (due to the fact that your starting loadout is dogwater) and they decided to make it the tutorial boss. I am currently petitioning the local government to provide humanitarian aid in the form of MANPADS.\r\n\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWar is hell. Also wow cool robot!\r\nThe game has many interesting characters. While choices you make will significantly impact what happens to the world, many people are simply destined to die regardless of your choices. This game can occasionally hit you in the feels so I wouldn't get too attached to anyone (stop hurting me FromSoft). There are multiple endings. Not going to say too much else here to avoid talking about spoilers, but overall you can tell they put a lot of effort into making this game. \r\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9/10\r\n\"Please stop saying dumb things! You're not even making sense-\"\r\nHIGH AND DRY\r\nI FLY HIGH\r\nWATCH THAT SUN RISE\r\nIN THE DAWN\r\n\r\nMost of the soundtrack goes for a more atmospheric feel as opposed to earlier Armored Core games, but there's a few really good songs in there (\"Rusted Pride\", and \"Contact with You\" for example).\r\n\r\nSlight Rant About Video Games and \"Curated Experiences\":\r\nMy criticism of many mainstream \"AAA\" games these days is they try way too hard to fit into a trope of \"interactive storytelling\" or attempting to be a \"unique cinematic experience\" to the point where it feels forced. A lot of publishers also tend to forget about the whole \"video game\" aspect of the media they are trying to produce. As a result of these trends (along with all the other monetization/marketing tactics which plague modern games), things often feel superficial because everyone is in the industry wants to appeal to a wider audience. \r\n\r\n\"Finally Some Good ****ing Food\":\r\nAC6 is pretty much the exact opposite in every regard. It is unapologetic about what it is and who it is made for. The game is only supported by its own merits alone without all the various marketing gimmicks, monetization schemes, or live service battlepass seasonal nonsense which publishers use as a crutch to determine success. People were asking FromSoft to make a new Armored Core game for years and AC6 was made with this specific target audience in mind. AC6 does streamline some of the systems to make it more accessible for new players (at least from what I heard), and somehow managed to make the much sought after \"cinematic experience\" that other games wish they had. I was expecting a game with giant robots where the universal solution to most problems is the Pilebunker, not one of best singleplayer/cooperative campaigns since Halo 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nNote on Multiplayer:\r\nTo be fair, I have not really tried the competitive multiplayer modes and mostly play cooperatively with a friend instead. While I cannot comment specifically on the PVP multiplayer, the Cooperative play mod essentially runs on the same logic as Elden Ring, where people can invade your missions unless you disable the feature. In my experience, 3 missions do not function as intended but only 2 of them require you to play solo. You may occasionally need to restart the \"Prison Break\" escort mission because sometimes the AI can bug out and fail to trigger specific objectives.",

        "review": "Having played almost every Armored Core game in the series, I have to say this game does a lot of things better, and a few more than that worse than the previous games in the series. The soundtrack is great, the gameplay is great, the story is really good, the characters are all great, but previous games in the series most definitely had a better soundtrack and gameplay. \n\nThe game is fun, but certainly not quite the Armored Core game a lot of people were hoping for. Personally I have a strong preference to the 3rd and 4th generation's style of gameplay functioning more as a third person shooter, rather than a combo-focused fighting game with an Armored Core aesthetic.\nFights have always been a slog in the series, especially when not knowing how much health an enemy combatant has, but Armored Core 6 has decided to probably make a lot of fights a bit too easy. I've made many builds to fight bosses with in my own preferred way, and that's fun, but in the back of my mind I always have the thought of \"Wow, I really could've done this a lot more easily with a pile-driver and 2x Zimmermans, huh.\"\n\nThis game punishes you for treating it like another game of the same series, in fact I really don't like this game's PvP, despite how addicting I find it. It always makes me think of how much fun I'd be having if they had ported Armored Core: for Answer to PC with well functioning net-play, I'd probably be having a lot more fun playing with friends and strangers that way. \nRather than being in awe that someone's build is really cool and functional, I'm mad that I've died to another one-shot combo build that somehow staggered me after missing with whatever high-impact weapon they use by 200 meters.\n\nMasaru Yamamura is a great game designer, but really I think he should focus on what made all the older games great, why their movement feels so good, that being staggered is not a fun thing to happen every fight, and that we really don't need more Dark Souls and Sekiro mechanics in Armored Core.\n\nI miss Arms-Forts, I miss the silly punk-rock music from Nexus through Verdict Day, I miss the slow turn-speeds and the lock box from older games. \nI'm hoping their next game, Armored Core 6.5 or Armored Core 7, will take less from their recent titles, and truly bring back Armored Core. Doesn't need to be a new game even, re-releasing all the old games on Steam as Re-mastered titles or literally just the same game would go a long way to bring back some interest to this franchise, give people the opportunity to play these games online again so we can all experience it, or be brought back to a happier time for those nostalgic for it.\n\nI know I complain a lot, but this game isn't a disappointment to me, it's probably everything I expected it to be, and that's a good thing. But I know they can do better if they avoid going for mass appeal again, unlike what FromSoftware did with Elden Ring. Take chances again, do the weird stuff that you used to do, more silly music, experiment with mechanics that probably not everyone will be on-board with, it's better than succumbing to apathy and making Dark Souls, again, but worse.",

From the initial reveal trailer in February of last year all the way up to when I finally got my hands on it in January, I could not stop thinking about it or talking about it. FromSoftware never fails to deliver. To anyone who thought this was going to be like Elden Ring, you're an idiot. To anyone who thought this was going to be just like the older Armored Core games, you're an idiot. I played this initially on Xbox, where I beat all 3 endings twice, and then again on here, so I have closer to 70 hours total. This isn't even a review, I'm just doing an autism ramble on why I like the game so much. - 12/10 (and it got me a following on YouTube)",

The story progression is simple but intuitive with a rich narrative filled with environmental story telling should you decide to dive below surface level. Somewhat of a challenging learning curve but worth the effort if you enjoy the combat. I have limited experience with the multiplayer, but it was fun from what little I played (though I expect an even steeper learning curve in this arena).\r\n\r\nComing form a fan of the series since the original back on PS1, this installment gives me hope for the future of the franchise!!!",

Ill start with whats bad and go from there.\n\nPlot - Well I wont lie is uninspiring at times, and a bit typical of AC game but that's really not what we are here for. It has some fun twists and great secrets, there is depth, but not too much depth that you find yourself overwhelmed or frustrated figuring things out. \n\nAtmosphere - This is where things pick up, players will feel caught up in the world building, level design, and buildup between bossfights. Really easy to get immersed in this game.\n\nGameplay - is VERY smooth. A lot closer ranged compared to past AC games but this is really made up for in how much more fluid the movement is in this game. Aiming, shooting, and moving all feel very organic and the player will really enjoy seeing improvement in their own movement as the game goes on.\n\nCustomization - Now as far as past AC games there are examples with more customization, however the variety of parts, weapons, and components for your mech is still nothing to scoff at. As far as fine tuning a perfect mech this game is a dream, complete down to being able to adjust the amount of wear and tear vs factory new shine on your paint job. You can not only make a mech that feels intuitive to your playstyle but you can spend hours making it look just perfect.\n \nAs a game primarily about mech building, testing, and fighting the updates released so far show that FROMSOFT does have interest in making sure there are viable, different ways to play which is an amazing sign,\n\nPvP is lovely, while it can feel rock paper scissors at times you only really see this in low to mid rank lobbies. People will rage and leave comments on your profile though in ranked though hahaha.\n\nAll in all an amazing game, I hope to see some small improvements in the next installation, but really any armored core game after Verdict Day is a blessing :)\n\n\n\n",

        "review": "Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon is an amazing game with satisfying combat, tons of customization, and good replay value.\n\nIn this game, you can customize your \"character\" to fit your needs for a mission you are about to head into. Going against annoying flying drones? Bring missiles and exterminate them all at once with one salvo. Going against short range grounded enemies? Bring a leg unit that will help you hover while you pepper them with explosives.\n\nYou can also pit the abomination you created in your garage against numerous ACs in the Arena.\n\nAnd if you are wondering about the boss encounters? It is glorious. Expect to be smashed by big bad mechs. Remember those drones your peppered with missiles? Remember those ground-based idiots who brought short range weapons against your flying quad-legs? Yeah, that's what you're gonna feel. Good luck.\n\nThe story though got the short end of the stick. This is not gonna be your cinematic video game with scripted scenarios. A lot of the story is gonna be delivered through on-screen dialogue. Mission briefings are gonna be through PowerPoint presentations. And sometimes, you are going to be left wondering \"WTF am I supposed to do again?\" and then proceed to murder everyone in your path towards the objective marker. Just remember at the start of the game, you are a mercenary and you will be hired by corporations to take on missions and get paid. Payment is equal to the contract price less expenses like ammunition cost and repairs. Yes, you need to be a CPA to play this game.\n\nPlayed this on an ancient machine with an I5-9600K and GTX 1070 Ti resulting in 0 crashes, 0 bugs, and consistent 59-60fps. The game engine is made of magic. Just kidding. The graphics are not that great. Which is fine for me as long as it runs buttery smooth. Don't get me wrong though, the fights still look spectacular. The product images and videos in the steam page is an accurate representation. Personally, I think it looks amazing.",

This ended up becoming my favorite mecha game ever. \n\n- Engaging game play and game mechanics\n- Compelling story with a great cast of characters, (you only hear their voices, you don't see anyone's face or body, a different approach then usual but written so well)\n- Huge level environments with amazing attention to detail and design language\n- Amazing mechanical designs for the different mecha types in the game; Kawamori and Miyatake were onboard to do mechanical work and it shows, they are veteran mecha designers who did work on 1980's anime.\n- Great sound design and music\n\nThe part that really heightened the experience playing this for me was a coop mod with a friend of mine.\n\n\nI plan on playing the previous games in the series.",

I enjoyed 100%-ing this game, and it was nice to see a different style of game by from software.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is that this is not a \"souls-like\", it's an armored core game. I really enjoyed the different style of gameplay with short missions of intense combat. The gameplay also allows for fighting multiple enemies quite well. The build mechanic where you can easily switch parts of your mech works really well too. While the first 3 chapters I found relatively easy (but still very fun), there were some challenging boss fights towards the end of the game. I also think it's worth doing all three endings to experience all missions and boss fights. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is amazing game, it runs well, it's well designed, is very fun, and has good replay value.",

Every AC part has its use so no two builds are going to be the same (unless you're always copying the meta). With up to 59 different missions, this game requires three total playthroughs for a full and complete experience. \n\nThe game does allow you to fulfil that mecha power fantasy, but it will humble you here and there with some of the most cinematic and adrenaline inducing boss fights. So learning, adapting, and overcoming is key. Everything in this game can be beaten with anything. And with a wide selection of weapons to choose from, you're spoiled for choice.\n\n10/10, my personal favourite game of all time.",

But this is just elden ring in fancy robots- not an armored core game.

        "review": "Amazing game. I love From games (and this is not my favorite one), but for gamers who are not fond of certain aspects of most From games, Armored Core 6 is a different animal. This game is straight to the point with non-stop action, a relatively straight-forward (and good) plot, and easily modified character builds. From did make this a difficult game, but players can always modify their ACs to overcome a boss and exploit that boss's weaknesses.\r\n\r\nGood or amazing: graphics, UI, soundtrack, sound cues, voice acting, and combat.\r\n\r\nSlightly negative: certain builds seem overly strong, to the point where one might be inclined to go with what works over how they want to play.\r\n\r\nOpportunity for improvement: From games have such massive potential for seamless co-op, and they never do it. This would be a great coop game. Would have taken me right back to playing Rampage, King of the Monsters, etc. with friends when I was a kid.",

Now hear me out, I by no means think they are bad games, I even delved into Elden Ring and gave it the good old college try, I am not good at it but I loved the world. So there I was watching the game awards with some friends and we got on the subject of FromSoft and I had said I was a big fan of their older IP Armored Core, it was Armored core 2 and another game S.L.A.I. (Steel lancer arena international) That got me into the Mech genre to begin with and as most people around me know, I love MECHS! So there we were watching and a trailer pops on and HOLY S*** IT'S ARMORED CORE!\n\nlol but I digress, I am a fan of the series but having been so long I went into it with mild expectations, scared that with the boom of Souls like games my fave from FromSoft might now be one, but no, the devs stayed to the roots and oh my god it's so beautiful! The world, oh my god does it feel ripped and war torn, the sound as ever is on point, the story, come on it's FromSoft, and the mechs, the customizability is on point, being able to build yourself a core suited to your play style. You like Firepower and Heavy armor like me? we got treads and cannons, enjoy a lighter super speed melee, you got swords and boosters, oh and bosses, you ever fight a giant mining rig? You want to? or a Mech serpent that shoots F****** LASER BEAMS AND S***?! ARMORED CORE HAS GOT YOU! I mean at this point I don't even know why you are reading this, it's worth the price, it has new game plus which the story does actually change and so does the endings, do yourself a favour, get it.\n\n[table]\n [tr]\n        [th]Category[/th]\n        [th]Score[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Visual[/th]\n        [th]9/10[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]9/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]9/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Price[/td]\n        [td]9/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Total[/td]\n        [td]9/10[/td]\n    [/tr]",

This game could have been a complete flop in terms of story and gameplay (hint: it's not), and as long as I could customize my robot and go hog wild, I would be content with it. I really hope they continue this franchise, because they have a faithful cash cow in me if they do. Happy hunting everyone!",

Once again, they have delivered. If you like FromSoft and are pretty on the fence about mechs. You may enjoy this.",

        "review": "Probably the best mecha game out there at the moment. It's not a game you'll spend hundreds of hours on, unless you really enjoy the PvP. My 50 hours are solo play only, first playthrough is about 15-20 hours, the story is actually pretty good and you have 3 endings to choose from. All of them are interesting and are nuanced enough that there aren't a \"good\" or \"bad\" ending. \n\nGameplay wise, this is one of the most enjoyable game in the recent years. It's not that hard, obviously you'll die and retry but deaths aren't as frustrating as Souls game because this game follows missions lasting for about 10 minutes each so you're not losing much by dying. Gameplay is super smooth, with a pretty simple loop meaning everyone will get the hang of it. Lots of customisation options, whether it has a gameplay impact (weapons, mecha frame, secondary weapons) meaning everyone will find their own build they can enjoy. You can roleplay as a gundam if you want, or create your own mecha, lots of paint customization (RGB slider), possibility of adding rust to get a wear down style if you like it, just an impressive range of choice.\n\nUnlike many other games out there, there aren't that many \"bad\" weapon in PvE. Obviously some of them are absolutely trash in PvP but the AI is much less nimble  than players and most weapons will manage to track properly and deal adequate damage.\n\nThis is a game where everyone will find their own enjoyement out of it. Wanna build a light mecha and go rushdown style ? You can. Prefer heavy and long range weaponry? Your choice. Light frame and heavy weapons? You'll be limited in weapon weight but you can have a light frame with two heavy machiguns (but you may have to sacrifice shoulder weapons for that). \n\nFor more \"hardcore\" players there a ton of things to optimize to get the best build possible, lots of statistics you can account for to maximize everything, and that will come in handy for PvP but you don't have to optimize your builds for PvE only (some bosses might be hard if you don't play attention bewteen the syngergy of your weapons though). \n\nAn excellent game overall. I didn't enjoy the PvP so I stopped after 100% the solo play but I would recommend it, a must if you want to try out the mecha genre.",

        "review": "I love every from software game made except this and I love older Armored Core games as well. \nTo put it bluntly, this game sucks.\n\nTo be clear, I have tried playing this multiple times years apart to give myself a fresh perspective and my opinion remains the same.\n\n1. Freedom of builds is gone. You are virtually required to build exactly what they want you to build to beat certain fights and bosses.  You will die over and over if you do not and it's generally agreed upon in the community that winning these fights outside of the builds they expect you to use is luck.\n\n2. Because you are \"Walter's Dog\" the sense of freedom and agency is gone. You are doing missions you must because your handler assigns them to you. You don't feel like a free agent influencing the world as you choose with your actions. This is more of a narrative issue but it doesn't eliminate the feeling of being tightly controlled and funneled in a narrative sense.\n\n3. The build options seem much more restrictive than in previous games.\n\n4. No coop. This is a staple of from software games and is frankly the biggest drawback this game has. I have platinum trophied Sekiro (which is my favorite title in spite of this problem) as well, so it's not that I am dependent on help to beat games like these. \n\n5. The stagger system is just bad. Damage is not purely avoidable no matter what you do and sometimes you will get hit by a falling mortar shell or something with no ability to dodge it, get stunlocked in place and take even more damage as a result or just outright die.\n\n6. I REVEL in boss difficulty in from software games, but this takes it to an absurd extreme. Bosses are orders of magnitude harder than the rest of the content. To where, I am convinced that if all content was removed and only bosses remained, the game would still require the same amount of time to complete on first playthrough minus maybe 20 minutes of walking.",

You can definitely see some of the nods to the old games here but this series has evolved so much over the years and for the better. This game is everything I used to imagine an Armored Core game would feel like (if we have the tech back then to make it a reality). Its a gorgeous game, the combat is snappy and fast without feeling so overwhelming you can't deal with it. Everything feels buttery smooth. The story is compelling and the voice actors all do a great job. The world feels real and oppressive in the dark way the AC games have always captured.\r\n\r\nI think the only real downsides are that 1) No Co-op and 2) the story is very short. The replay missions and log hunter stuff does add some meat to it but the missions themselves are not terribly long for the most part (something that's always been true of the AC games) and so if you race through the campaign, you'll be done very quickly. It is worth it to explore the mission maps, there are little bits and pieces of lore scattered about in the forms of logs.",

This is truly a gem of a game...a fascinating war drama, sci-fi, mech combat game that allows various playstyles, has great customisation, is a challenge and everything comes together to make an amazing game. Story, music, graphics, gameplay, etc. it's all there. I played on keyboard and mouse and highly recommend that method of input, the default control scheme really is one of the best I've ever played for a pc game.\r\n\r\nFires of Rubicon is one of those games I see myself looking back on in a decade and being thankful I got to experience it in my one life I get. Makes me happy I picked up a controller & keyboard and mouse as a kid and gaming has been a part of my life since.",

Armored Core rewards knowledge and punishes ignorance.\n\t[*]Don't hold onto parts that aren't working out, you recover 100% of their cost when you sell them.\n\t[*]New players will find Armored Core's meta is like nothing they've experience before. Don't be afraid to spend an hour or two testing builds and coming to terms with what the game is asking of you.\n\t[*]Be sure to play the campaign three times.\n[/list]\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]      \n        As a longtime fan, its pretty neat to see everything from AC2's door hacking to AC5 boost kicks remixed, revamped, and re-imagined for an entry that is both a bold step forward and a culmination of all that has come before. \n\t\n        Combat is the best it's ever been in the franchise. It's fast-paced somewhat like AC4 but exponentially more controllable due to the advent of an orbital lock-on system which also drastically improves melee combat. ACS Strain, where staggered opponents are open to critical hits, while not new is a definite improvement over Heat and Primal Armor in serving as a way to both elevate and balance combat. These additions result in major improvements to AC and boss battles in particular. The [i]feel[/i] of these battles as you weave through enemy fire, knock your target of balance, and charge in just in time to land a devastating Laser Blade strike that results in their slow-motion death all while [i]never[/i] fumbling with the controls never gets old. The only issue is that most of your opponents will be MTs, foes that are swatted aside with unsatisfying ease. I was often left with a similar sense of yearning I felt while play Sekiro, a desire for more mid-bosses and less two-hit dregs. \n\n\tFlimsy MTs are not the only historic issue that once again rears its head. Certain weapon types continue to be overly utilitarian, with a pair of humble rifles almost never leaving my sides during my S-Rank run. When it comes to the Armored Core itself, flexible mid-weight biped builds still seem to be the \"right answer\" for single-player and multiplayer is dominated by meta builds. The economy itself continues to feel like a mere thematic conceit with credits being easy to come by and as always devolves into a non-factor around the 1/4 of the way through. \n\n\tParts and customization continue to be what you expect from an AC game. There are plenty of parts, but it definitely feels like the pointless incrementality of the older entries has been toned down with variants of any individual weapon category thankfully reduced to just two or three and the like. The overall act of customizing your AC to meet either the needs of the mission or your personal preference with said parts is made easier to grasp with the aid of several tutorials that previous entries sorely lacked. Those with sufficient skill will take great pleasure in the revamped emblem and AC painting systems that offer deeper customization than ever.  \n\n\tThe missions themselves were pleasant if a bit easy due to the aforementioned MTs with a few interesting set-ups like mounting the heavily publicized Strider or taking down a warship fleet in mid-air. You can see the influence of modern FROM in the multiple vantage points from which to surveil enemy packs and optional bosses tucked away in dark corners. The Ace Combat-style radio chatter that pervades the missions gives them a better feel than those from previous entries and enhances their episodic quality. The wider narrative is great by Armored Core standards, which is to say it's acceptable. The audio only approach is impersonal, but the emotional beats are there.  \n\n\tWhile I wish the game provided a little more push-back, AC6 is a joy to play. FROM has whittled away all the counter-intuitiveness if not outright contrarianism of the past, leaving only this gem that I can recommend without reservation.",

        "review": "Armored Core VI was my introduction to the AC franchise and I immediately mourned the time I'd spent without having experience in this awesome, incredible, awesome game series. Perhaps it was for the best, as I hear varying things about how difficult the barrier to entry is in other AC games, but Fires of Rubicon was kind enough to wine and dine me before we settled in for many intense nights together.\n\nFrom the jump, AC VI warms you up with a simple-to-pilot starter Armored Core, (what the mechs are called), and doesn't ask any more of you than you're comfortable with. After a brief foreplay tutorial, you're given the option to explore and find out what you're really into. The shop is available to you with all sorts of new toys, and you can earn some freebies by going through the more advanced tutorials, so that's immediately where my focus went. I wanted to try anything and everything to find my AC kinks and take on the dom role that I was always meant to play.\n\nAfter some clumsy fiddling around here and there, I quickly found my erogenous zones to be with the fattest stack of missile launchers on my back, a bazooka-type on one hand, and rapid-fire on the other. I confidently continued to pleasure myself in the face of my enemies, enjoying my high-octane affair with AC VI as it let me have my way with it. Little did I know, our power dynamic was about to shift, as I'd yet to meet Balteus, who would prove to be my first (and second, third, and so on,) death as Rubicon showed me how it gets off. That is to say, I truly felt like we were growing together as a toxic couple and learned to exploit each others weakness through a series of abusive exchanges.\n\nAs I continued to play, I was treated to beautiful visions of slaughter, mechanical carnage, and the luminous glow of ruin laying waste to Rubicon and the forces that inhabited it. From Handler Walter sensually whispering sweet nothings in my ear, engaging in a strenuous affair with Ayre, and being unloaded upon by bombardments of artillery and unleashing my load upon others, I would've sworn that my soul was firmly planted on Rubicon at any given moment. The immersion reached was nothing short of orgasmic, and I felt at home inside of my Armored Core.\n\nTruthfully, AC VI allows you to find and express yourself in the truest reflection of the human soul- your awesome mech. The customization is unrivaled and with enough love and attention, you can bring to life the most beautiful and unholy climax in a burst of mechanical conception. There's never a dull dance to be had when you experiment the way I did on Rubicon.\n\nI don't know why this review got so sexual, but I suppose that's just the kind of game Armored Core VI is. It knows what you want better than you do, and it's not going to beat around the bush. It's a tender and fleeting lover, but you know that the nights you spend together are going to be remembered fondly for years to come.\n\nCinematic playthrough: https://youtu.be/0yTjqHQzsSA",

It's a From Software game, so half the fun is in the challenge with them. The other half is the customization of your build.",

It probably didn't help that I was completely averse to the customization element of the game, which is like 50% of the experience, as well as playing anything other than a speed agility based build. Boss fights in particular destroyed me.\r\n\r\nThat said, once I started playing this fromsoft game like a fromsoft game, i.e. recognizing enemy attack patterns, learning and tightening up my own movesets, and of course, dying over and over, I managed to fly through the rest of the game's content in two or three sessions.\r\n\r\nAmazing gameplay, and everything else is polished to hell, I have no complaints. Definitely one of my new fave fromsoft games.",

There's a system of customising what weapons your mech uses and none of it matters because every loadout melts everything. It's not even the satisfying kind of easy, it's just tedious.",

The mech customization is some of the best in the series with the wide variety of builds keeping the game fresh on multiple replays. There's zero punishment for buying a weapon you don't like so you can experiment as much as you like. The multiplayer combat is fantastic although there is no proper matchmaking outside of ranked modes so be prepared to get your ass kicked a few times while figuring out the build you want to use in PVP. The story is simple but that's it's biggest strength and there's some really good emotional moments in the latter half of the game. While I wouldn't reccomend this to the faint of heart due to it's high difficulty (it's a fromsoft game afterall) if you think you're up to snuff this might be the greatest action combat game you'll ever play.",

        "review": "Armored Core6 is solid. I've played through the game multiple times already and unlocked the NG+ content. AC6 uses a mission structure for the campaign and battle arena duels for pvp skirmishes, and the pacing of gameplay is pretty good. So definitely think you would enjoy the mech design, combat and all the eye candy. Sits roughly around a 4/5, because there are a handful of things that could have been handled better, like the music and sound design:\r\n\r\n* Even though most of the mechs you come across are cool, some of the \"robot themes\" fall flat out of the necessity of their use, like the \"droning menu screen music.\" While you're sitting in the menu screen building your mech, which you do quite often, there is this single constant droning hum that makes you want to fall asleep, because there is literally no variation in the baseline. Am not joking about this, it's actually exhausting to listen to, even though it somehow fits \"the robot music genre.\"\r\n\r\n* Another place where the robot theme is followed to a fault is the story. There's nothing really noteworthy about the story because in the attempt to make you care about the AI's plight / feeling the need to deliver the narrative with \"lethargic, disconnected, robotic voice acting, where the voice actors are reading the dialog and narrative - at you,\" you wind up not giving a fuck about any of it, skip through it, and just play the game.\r\n\r\n* Finally, most of the game's balance makes sense until you reach the end of chapter bosses for sections III, IV and V. Totally get that fromsoft bosses are going to have \"different difficulty spikes,\" but in the case of AC6 we're going from quasi-reality to all-of-a-sudden everything is allowed to jump offscreen / teleport around you like you're trying to catch a fly with a pair of chopsticks. So the fact that these mechanics were just \"robotically thrown in\" and there were was no sense of progression to these \"spikes,\" made the balance of these boss encounters come off as \"forced\" in context of the rest of the game. Where other fromsoft games have far more variety and a better sense of progression, rather than just flipping a light switch on and off just because you hit the end of a chapter. The only reason you notice is because it sticks out like a sore thumb. Note: Definitely change your camera sensitivity settings, up to the maximum (10), this will definitely help you with tracking during these encounters.\r\n\r\nBesides a handful of basic things, definitely recommend the game. There are a bunch of different weapons and mech parts (boosters, targeting computers, generators, etc) you can combine in different ways to modify the way your mech handles, from chonky beasts to quick agile ninjas with rockets, lasers and gats - so you can keep things straight forward or pull off combat-shotty-laser-sword combos. Definitely worth picking up.",

But apart from that, you can customize the color, wear, decals, and lights of your machine, making it perfectly yours, and even name it! There's fighting in a mech, and then fighting in a mech you perfectly customized!\r\n\r\nThe voice work is also amazing. You never see a single face in the game, but the talented VAs carry more than enough depth to convey emotion.\r\n\r\nYou are going to have a great time, and hopefully more is on the horizon!",

        "review": "One of FromSoftware's easier games, but it is just pure destructive fun. Every design decision you make in the garage, you feel in the missions. Sound design is great. Mechs just feel fun to control. You feel like a badass when scything through cannon fodder enemies, but bosses are intimidating like in other FromSoft titles.\r\n\r\nThe story is short and simple, but like in other FromSoft titles, you have to play it through multiple times to experience it all. The characters you meet are engaging, both as comrades and nemeses. There are a few instances where some characters could be better utilised, but overall I enjoyed my time with them.\r\n\r\nI did not engage in the multiplayer, so I have no idea if that is fun. Multiplayer doesn't interest me in this kind of game. I exclusively played singleplayer, and completed the entire game 3 times, to see all 3 endings, and replayed loads of missions to get all achievements. It was super fun finding what parts I liked and didn't like, and trying out different loadouts for specific mission parameters.\r\n\r\nIf you like the idea of FromSoft games, but think they are a bit too intimidating to play, try this one. It's much easier, it's much less of a commitment, its mission-based designed to be played in short bursts, but it very much feels like a FromSoft game. I wholeheartedly recommend it, 9/10 for me.",

The gameplay is a challenging learning curve at first, but is easy to grasp. That being said its better to play on controller, but is doable on keyboard if your a psychopath like that. If you like Dark Souls level difficulty, robots, or damn near schizophrenic detective boards of story connections this is the game for you, Buddy.",

However you could still just bash your head (your current build) against the wall until it works. Add on top of that, the combined decades of From Software´s game design experience and you get something, that also looks and (most importantly) feels excellent. As a bonus, a Fromsoft game that runs well on PC.",

        "review": "I've never played a mecha game before this much less an armored core game, but I was interested in a new fromsoft game so bought it on release.  I could not have been happier with this game, the story, the gameplay, the characters, all so well put together and enjoyable they really knocked it out of the park.  I'm gonna avoid spoilers, but make sure you play through the story multiple times, it truly is an incredible experience working towards the \"true ending\".  I haven't had this much fun in a game in years, this may be the first time I'm begging for DLC just so I have more content to play through. 10/10 absolutely stunning game.",

        "review": "Fromsoftware never fails to deliver. Never having played an Armored Core game I went into this blind but this game has brought me into the Armored Core series. The really fast paced movement and fighting was definitely different than the other Fromsoftware games I've played so it took me a while to get used to that (Balteus) but once I did I was having a blast playing.\n\n· Mech customization is on another level you can make your mech look like basically any mech from any show you like and there's even a emblem editor (like old black ops style) where you can merge shapes together to make emblems that you can attach to your mechs.\n· Build options in this game let you to go with whatever fighting style you want you could go anywhere between a lightweight build that moves quick and go up close with shotguns and swords to a heavyweight tank with railcannons and rocketlaunchers on your arms and shoulders or even a flying tetrapod build if you prefer being a aerial fighter.\n· The story also has good replayability with lovable characters and there's actually new missions and choices that you get to do in NG+ and NG++ which can give you up to 3 different endings with new bosses showing up for each of them. \n· This game was pretty hard for me at first and it'll probably kick your ass over and over but eventually you'll start noticing what certain enemies are weaker too and how to get over some of the defenses they have and I think that makes the challenge much more enjoyable and rewarding.\n\nAs a first time Armored Core player I highly recommend this game for anyone that is  interested in Fromsoftware games and/or mechs",

        "review": "Armored Core 6 has got to be one of my all-time favourite games. This game genuinely does everything almost perfectly, there is very little that Armored Core 6 does wrong. I asked for Miyazaki to give us a better game than Elden Ring, and boy did he deliver.\n\nPros:\n- Overall fantastic missions. The many missions you will complete throughout the game all feel very fun and have their own unique sets of challenges.\n- Tons of customisation options. There are so many different body parts, weapons, and other pieces to put together your perfect AC. And very rarely does a build feel like it can't complete most missions effectively.\n- Writing is absolutely phenomenal. The story and themes of this game are extremely captivating and have left a lasting impression honestly stronger than any previous FromSoftware title I have personally played.\n- Music is incredible. FromSoftware games always have a phenomenal soundtrack but the soundtrack in this game is just a masterpiece. I only wish the music was louder in some missions so I could hear it better.\n- Combat is incredibly satisfying and provides a good challenge while still making you feel like an unstoppable powerhouse.\n- Colour and decal customisation for ACs is amazing, the deceptively simple customisation allowed for your AC can take up hours upon hours of playtime.\n- This game is filled with memorable characters, even some of the most insignificant characters to the overall plot have incredible personality and characterisation within their dialogue and even the designs of their ACs themselves in some cases.\n- Bosses overall are probably some of the most enjoyable fights that I have personally experienced in a FromSoftware game. There are very few bosses that feel cheap, unfair, or unenjoyable to fight.\n- Multiple endings as well as a secret ending unlocked through first getting the other 2 endings gives the game tons of replayability despite its somewhat short length and linear mission structure.\n- Graphics and visuals are spectacular, this game truly has some of the most stunning visual displays I have seen in media.\n- Sound design is extremely crisp and satisfying. Weapons have a real feeling of impact to their sounds, and the sound of your AC's boosters is just so nice to listen to.\n\nCons:\n- I personally felt there could have been a little more choice involved with the game's endings. Other than a couple of choices near the end of the game, there is very little that actually influences which ending you will get.\n- Requirements for S-ranking missions are relatively simple but I wish the game would outline them a bit more to the player. Missions should give at least some idea of how to actually S-rank them.\n- Lightweight ACs feel like they don't give enough for the sacrifice required. You hardly get much more speed than a medium AC at the cost of being significantly easier to stagger and having much lower health. It would have been nice if lightweights were good at something other than just spamming quick boosts, especially when medium ACs hardly have any more trouble doing so than lightweights.\n- The FCS system can be slightly frustrating to deal with at times. It would have been nice to see another way of manually changing your FCS target other than moving your camera, though I suppose the controls might have also become cluttered that way.\n- Melee tracking is incredibly inconsistent and sometimes melee attacks will literally whiff despite the target being inside the literal swinging energy blade. I'd like to see a world where the Moonlight and Moonlight but red aren't the only melee weapons that don't reek like diseased feet.",

        "review": "A pretty good Mecha game. The weapons are fun for the most part, the part variety allows for a wide array of builds, and the scale of fights can make them really exciting and intense. The colors Fromsoft use here are pretty monotone, but the actual variety and quality of the set pieces makes up for it for the most part. This game has a few downsides, though. Some of the bosses are nauseatingly unfun fights like the Ibis where the enemy doesn't really have any of the limitations imposed on the players besides the stagger bar, and almost feel like they're were designed for an entirely different game with how drastically different they move and attack compared to everything else in the game. Some of the characters really feel more like they are just spouting exposition at the player, rather than actually talking your character. And some scenes that would have a lot more weight if you could at least see them happen entirely off screen, cheapening what could have been tragedies that tug at the player's heart into something inferred happened off screen, with little to no player involvement as they handle what are frankly very uninteresting objectives in comparison to what the player is told is happening. It really feels like this game could have done with at least a few more hours of content to properly explore the cast, or at the very least cutscenes that go more in depth into the characters.\r\nAll in all, a very fun mecha game with enjoyable action and customization, but kind of lacking narratively.",

        "review": "I am coming from a decade long of playing From Soft games. These are my impressions so far...\n\nThe targeting system in the beginning of the game is disappointing when compared to Elden Ring and especially that it is tied to a stat. Having at least an active targeting system for early bosses would have benefited this game greatly. \n\nThe helicopter boss is easily my least favorite FromSoft starting boss. The whole fight becomes 'fight the camera' more than the actual boss itself. Another lazy way they make this boss 'hard' is that it constantly hides out of bounds of the small battle area, meaning you hit an invisible wall when trying to melee the helicopter. I beat this boss but it wasn't satisfying given that it felt like I 'lucked out', whereas other FromSoft games would punish me for such behavior.  Point is, this should not be a pre-customization boss and it was a bit tone deaf of FromSoft to place him here.\n\nThe non-boss content is fun and gives me that ZOE2 feeling, although easy aside from some difficulty spikes in earlier areas. The graphics are gorgeous on my OLED / Nvidia 9080. The music is incredible good and I have already saved the soundtracks on yt music.\n\n\nSo far, I recommend this game, but I think it only really picks up after the first chapter, once the player gets access to mechs that behave responsively in the way they want.   \n\n8/10",

Boss fights are challenging, yet accessible once you understand how they move and find the right stuff.  The story is good, difficulty isn't a full blown Souls game, and the Deluxe gives access to the soundtrack and an art book.  A solid game!  \n\nIf you do pick up AC6, I recommend watching the Story Trailer for additional context that takes place just before the game begins.",

My initial play though of the campaign took 19 hours including plenty of garage time and all initial arena combats. It seems they tried to extend this by adding new content to NG+ and NG+2. However, these consist of a handful of added missions and \"new perspectives\" on old missions, which feel much lazier than the already short main missions, often devolving into eliminating reused enemies in a reused arena. Additionally, 85% of the NG+ campaigns are exactly the same but worse, as the difficulty does not increase in any way and you have access to more items, making them a repetitive, short cakewalk. \n\nThe game feels fun at points, but when missions can take <2 minutes without anything of interest occurring and the entire of the ACTUAL campaign being maybe 15 hours, I would wait for a heavy sale.",

It leaves wonderful first impression, until you realise that boss fights are just...fucking infuriating. Not only are you constantly fighting extremely narrow view and lock-on that just won't stick, you're fighting opponents that don't follow the same rules you do: unlimited ammo, unlimited energy, unlimited dash - they can even go outside of the fucking bounds of the playable map and be safe from harm there while they pelt you with everything they got. \r\nThe game wants you to switch out your setup constantly which shouldn't be mandatory to progress in FROMSOFT game. \r\n\r\nLook, I know there'll be plenty of GIT GUD boys out there, but check my records, I 100% all 3 dark soul games and finished Sekiro and Elden RIng. Never have I felt this amount of just pure designer malice directed towards the player as while playing this game.\r\nSo yeah, I quit. \r\n\r\nI would give it side thumb or something because there is plenty to love here it's just too frustrating to play.",

        "review": "I've been playing Armored Core games since the '90s, and I've logged over a thousand hours on AC6, diving deep into both ranked and unranked PvP.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest issues with the game are the hardlock and stagger systems—these mechanics! They don’t belong in an Armored Core game and should never appear in the series again! With these features, the game feels more like a fighting game, akin to Tekken, with 2D combat in 3D graphics.\n\nLet me explain further.\n\n1.) Hardlock:\n\nThis provides too much consistency, taking away the player's ability to express skill through unique movements. Once you start using hardlock, your movements become predictable, linear and very similar to others, making the game feel like a 2D fighting game rather than a dynamic mech experience. Why you may ask? There's this invisible tether you have on your target!\n\nAdditionally, hardlock is far superior to softlock and manual aiming. While some might argue that softlock offers a slight bonus in lock-on speed. I'd say try using a Zimm shield build with softlock or a kiter with a shield. You'll quickly notice that these builds is only effective because of hardlock. The bonus lock-on speed from softlock is so minimal that it hardly matters; HARDLOCK SIMPLY BURIES THEM ALL!\n\n2.) The stagger system: \n\nThis was NEVER a part of Armored Core, and its introduction has made it the most crucial mechanic in the game?! This further shifts the feel toward a fighting game rather than a true mech simulation. When a player is staggered, they lose control of their AC, limiting their ability to play effectively. The only option is to use an expansion slot, which centralizes PvP around this system.\n\nI could go on about how the FCS functions poorly, the in-game UI lacks intentional design, the game balance is off, and how you can just wiggle your way to victory using a LAMM leg.\n\nTL;DR: The game feels like a tech demo, no matter how you look at it. The campaign is too short, and the multiplayer seems like an afterthought.\n\nDespite these flaws, I still recommend the game because I love Armored Core. BUT BUY IT ONLY ON SALE! NEVER ON FULL PRICE! \n\nAC VI is probably the worst entry in the series, next to Formula Front.",

        "review": "TL;DR\nIf you love AC1-AC3 era, you won't like it. AC4 era, maybe. V an VD maybe.\nIf you enjoy games like Dark Souls, Sekiro, or pattern games, even schmups, you will most likely enjoy this.\n\nIf you're not sure if you want to buy this game, here is how I would view it, since I already bought it. Is this game worth $60? Does it offer a lot of replayability for $60. My honest answer is no. I wouldn't recommend based on that. If you truly want to buy this game, get it on sale. Here's my thoughts.\n\nIf you notice the reviews, you can easily tell that the vast majority of them have fairly low hours. If you click further, most users also have no added time in a two weeks span. Use the browse all reviews function, not the front page from the store. This should be a clear indicator of the \"value\" of the game. There's really not a lot of replayability for this $60 game. It's an easily forgettable game, play once or thrice (if you want all the game endings) and leave it to collect dust.\n\nSpeaking of forgettable, there's nothing really memorable to speak of. This is a game that is Armored Core only in name. It has a similar vibe to Dark Souls, Sekiro, Elden Ring, etc., FromSoftware's other titles which brought them to fame. Armored Core didn't bring them to fame, it never appealed to the general audience and it was a niche game within a niche genre. The mech genre was dying, along with this series. The new \"Soulslike\" mechanics were added to revitalize the series and attract those familiar with the \"Soulslike\" mechanics. Here's the big thing, Armored Core 6, during an interview with the lead staff, stated it would not be another \"Soulslike\" game. Except, that's exactly what we ended up getting, so the OG fans will not like this.\n\nThe mechanics? The AC AI is specifically scripted to dodge your first 2 shots, ALWAYS, perfectly. After that, you're free to hammer them until a certain amount of time passes when they will perform 2 perfect dodges again. The AI appears intelligent at first, but it's a simple thoughtless pattern.\n\nPatterns? This games revolves around patterns, specifically the bosses. The boss patterns catch majority of players off-guard, however, once you understand there is no intelligence to the bosses except a beautiful and artful display of patterns to distract you, there's nothing special about this game. Ironically, most players get stuck on the Sea Spider boss. I beat it first try and found it far easier than Balteus, mostly because you have better equipment by this time.\n\nIn fact, there is a certain youtuber who plays this game expertly without lock-on ability, and can stand still, taking no damage, and only counterattack the boss when they begin their pattern attack (btw they do win). It is truly wild to think this is the style of gameplay Armored Core has chosen to shift to. It doesn't feel like an Armored Core game at all. While V and VD were the most despised games of the series, even I would put them beside the rest of the AC games now, as members that retained the feeling that it is, indeed, an Armored Core game.\n\nArmored Core 6 is a massive departure forcing the stagger guage upon us. The stagger guage is a small attack window where you, or the enemy, is stunned and bonus damage is applied when it is triggered. This essentially boils down to a damage race, with stagger being a large factor, and the game meta will revolve around this. In order to defeat bosses, you absolutely have to take advantage of the stagger guage. While it is possible without using it, it is insanely difficult (I actually tried it, never want to again).\n\nThe weapons, they are largely unbalanced and correlate with stagger. Shotguns are the notorious meta for stagger and damage. Very few weapons are actually viable. There is no true long-range gameplay. This game forces you to play up close and personal, hence shotguns being great. Melee is also a big plus, which is not a bad thing, but the implementation of melee is terrible. Melee is locked to a cooldown, so you can't use it to cut down fodder units because of the cooldown. Reserve melee for boss fights, big damage, long cooldown. It's a shame because blading even fodder units in older AC games felt satisfying. There are some weapons you cannot dual wield. Richochet exists, if you're shooting too far away, your bullets effectively do nothing, forcing the close-range gameplay. Gatling guns are amazing up close as well, can't say the same for the other MGs and rifles, they just don't do enough damage to effectively stagger an enemy or pummel them by sheer force. Handguns, no reason to use them when better options exist. At least in the older games, they were viable, in AC6, absolutely not.\n\nWhile movement improved somewhat, it's super janky, it doesn't feel very mechanical. It just feels like a person cosplaying as a robot and you'll notice it. There's a level of twitchiness when you're turning the character around, it's akin to just a normal humanoid RPG game. The camera can be severely awful at times. On that note, there is Hard-Lock, Soft-Lock, and No-Lock. Hard-lock, you never lose your target. Soft-lock is similar to the OG lock style, just a round lock-box instead. No-Lock, self-explanatary.\n\nCustomization is nowhere near on the same level as older games, one of the greatest features of Armored Core that earned it praise for years since its first release. Parts are reduced to a tiny fraction of the older games. For a game that is next-gen, it is severely lacking. Many things were culled to simplify for the new audience. The names and designs are underwhelming. They did try to do as many nolstagic throwbacks though. Those nolstagic gimmicks do not substitue for good bones of an Armored Core game, which this game doesn't have. It only has the skin of it. Though it's supposed to be a reboot, again, I would rather play the first Armored Core game over this.\n\nOh, but Rusty and the rest. Rusty is barely memorable, though I will attribute him being similar to Solo Wing Pixy. I liked Pixy better than Rusty. Ayre, not memorable, she is akin to Cortana from Halo, a voice talking in your head that goes crazy. Cortana was better. Joshua O'Brien, White Glint (even just 1 mission at Line Ark) are far more memorable, even Apple Boy. Even MTs are more memorable, like OWL, Big White, Super Scimitar, Devastator, and I could go on. Point is, the cast in Armored Core 6 is forgettable.\n\nThey tried really hard for a nolstagic trip while also catering to a new audience, yet ultimately didn't succeed in what made Armored Core amazing. Last Raven is the last true Armored Core game, and it's pretty advanced with part destructability and tuning. It's followed closely by AC4, FA, and lagging far behind is V and VD. I'd rather grind through Last Raven and all 6 endings all over again any day over this.",

I am a casual gundam fan and enjoy building the models. I’d been itching for a ‘gundam’ mech game but was hesitant trying this before because it’s a fromsoftware title.\n\nThis game is that ‘gundam’ mech game I wanted. It plays a bit like ace combat and a bit like a souls-like to me. There’s big bosses with big health bars you have to dodge and stagger, they’re tough, but they’re not unforgiving (so far). Other missions feel a little more arcade-y.\n\nI haven’t unlocked too many parts yet, but I can already tell the customization will be my favorite part of this game. There’s endless options for colors, materials, decals, and parts.\n\n-\n\nI originally reviewed this game after playing for 4 hours the first night I bought it. Its been 4 days and 20 hours of gameplay later, and I just finished my first play through. I'm back to say this is one of my favorite games of all time.",

Like I don't even dislike the game, but I cannot actually recommend it. I'll probably even try to finish it. I'm a huge fan of From Software games, but this is not really doing it for me the way the Soulsborne games do.\n\nLike another example is the way that input queues work. In Elden Ring, if I press a button it queues that and does what I pressed. Sometimes that gets me killed--like if I accidentally heal when I meant to dodge. But Armored Core 6 doesn't seem to queue inputs. So I'll die frustrated knowing that I pushed the button I intended, but the game didn't respond. I'd rather die because the game queued my inputs and my inputs were stupid than not queue my inputs and I die because of that.",

PvE offers enough replayability thru the two new game pluses, any remaining replayability would be getting all the achievements as well as 100% completion of the log hunts/arena and S-ranked in the mission replays. Take your time, Fromsoft likes throwing difficulty curves at you so try to learn the enemies and you can always change your build to suit the opponent.\n\nSome mods have come out for the game but it can be tricky setting it up properly without getting your account banned from the fromsoft servers so just keep that in mind.\n\nI personally have made most of my hours doing PvP, completing the game to 100%, and participating in community tournaments. PvP is hard to recommend because of the way Fromsoft set up their AC6 servers. Very similar issues akin to Darksouls or Elden Ring PvP with latency issues and poor functionality for custom lobbies beyond the basics like changing a map or dictating how long a match can last. Word is they might be making a new AC6.5/AC7 so time will tell if that will spark any life into the pvp combat without having to",

The healing allows more fun bosses in general, as well as longer and more difficult missions. Aside from that, you simply build your ultimate AC, changing it up when the mission calls for it, and enjoying honestly one of the most straightforward yet captivating From soft game I've played (still has that hidden lore, but it expands the world further and in good ways). Don't feel afraid that it's too difficult, I can assure you this game is extremely forgiving. I hope this game gets DLC, it honestly deserves it. I give it a 9/10. If you pay full price for this game, I honestly feel like you are getting your money's worth. You get 40-100 hours of quality story and gameplay, and I'm glad for every second of it.",

        "review": "NOT WORTH THE MONEY - SAVE IT!!!\n\nSeriously, From Soft has been a letdown with both the ER DLC and this (just got around to playing it). \n\nI just finished the game and here is my take.\n\nFirst, it is incredibly short. Most missions will take you 20 minutes to do. On several of the missions, I was like 'thats it???'\n\nSecond, movement/combat - its really annoying. The best way I can put it is that you're an ice skater with a jetpack. You move in a linear direction and sometimes it is nearly impossible to evade attacks.\n\nThird, lack of challenge - throughout the entire game I was just smoking everything (after the first boss struggles b/c I was learning the controls/concept). Bosses, 'S' ranked arena enemies, killing them all in the first go. \n\nThe second to last boss posed the biggest threat. Why? Not because the attacks - the patterns were quite simple. No, it was because I kept running out of ammo to fight. Was it my aim? Possibly, so I tried to wait until my stupid robot was locked on with the red circle. Still ran out of ammo.\n\nNothing is more frustrating to have a boss beat in an action style shooter only to be short on ammo. Totally flawed. Sure, you could argue the logic was to have you experiment with builds - which I did. But, in a gun mech shooter, boss battles should come with enough ammo regardless of what build you use without requiring 99% accuracy.\n\nOh, and in that particular battle, the lock on feature stopped functioning entirely. I tried many, many times to get it to work. I had to restart the game. \n\nFifth, game length. Incredibly short. I have 17 hours on record and 2 of those were spent trying not to run out of ammo.\n\nSixth, atmosphere/world. Nothing special at all. I could have likely envisioned something more creative. I'm not flattering myself - if snowy mountains, boring caves that look the exact same and maps used multiple times for different levels is your thing, then go for it.\n\nThis game sucks and is laughable at a $60 price tag. From Soft is acting like they can just throw out crappy short games/content like the ER DLC. \n\nDon't get mad at me if you love From Soft and the AC series. I really enjoyed ER and Dark Souls and felt those were well worth the money, but this felt like a crappy movie sequel without any substance or thought. The only thing that kept me going was the voice acting of Ayre.",

        "review": "TL;DR: big mech fighting other mechs is fun and cool\n\ni never really write reviews nor have i ever posted one but i felt like i should with this game. i knew nothing about armored core as a whole but i recall seeing the teaser trailer for it during game awards and thought it looked interesting and once i saw that it had mechs, i was already on board. fast forward to the games release and i see people customizing their ac's, making insane emblems and decals, showing off clips and it convinced me to buy it, and i dont regret it. there are many things i wish to write about but i'd end up looking insane but i dont care because in short, this game is fun, yes, there are times where an enemy becomes the thing that keeps you up at night but once you finally beat them, it feels like another goal accomplished. i remember fighting balteus for the first time (before the nerf) and feeling like it was the real deal but when i finally beat it, i never felt such relief when playing a video game before, then it hit me, if i was able to beat this boss then i'm able to beat any boss so long as i keep trying and not throw a fit (stupid, i know, but we ball), and thats what i did for the rest of the game. im not sure what else i can say other than it's worth it and that im wishing and praying for dlc and to one day play all the previous titles. this was just my experience, maybe yours is vastly different and that alright.",

An excellent experience from start to finish, a glorious story that takes queues from mecha classics as well as SciFi hallmarks such as Dune, just a thoroughly enjoyable game. ahhh, it's like a dream! \r\n",

But the devs have been balancing it since, from what I hear. \n\n I can't compare it to previous instalments as it's my first AC game, but I love the skill ceiling the game has. You ever replay a mission in a game you sucked at the first time around, but come back to on a 2nd playthrough? Only to dominate that mission the 2nd time around using the same gear, to to realise it WAS a \"skill issue\" the first time around, and to realise how much you've improved.\n\nWill definitely buy the next instalment if they buy more.\n\nOnly complaint is that even though it's artistically impressive, it's not graphically impressive. They are using a ageing game engine, they seem to be unwilling to give up. It runs far better than Elden Ring (their other title using the same engine), with less stutters, and a higher frame limit of 120FPS, instead of 60. No GPU shader compilation stutter like Elden Ring had.",

(Shame they haven't been remastered and added to Steam)\n\nMy only criticism, is that the game has 3 different endings, all of them are great and leave you with more questions than answers but for some reason the game soft locks one of its endings, essentially forcing you to play the game twice over before being allowed to play the key missions necessary to play that third storyline ending, and the missions that determine the storyline you're going with aren't marked out clearly enough, it's just a very small icon in the corner of the picture of the mission during mission selection.",

The primary emphasis is really on the combat, which is fun and challenging. The secondary emphasis is on building and customizing your mech in the assembly/garage.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting how minimalist it is. By that, I mean there aren't any NPCs with faces or animated humans or video calls. It's all voice acting. In game, the textures and environments are look realistic enough but most structures are non-destructible and other objects, like trees, simply fall over and disappear. Some reviewers have complained to that AC6 seems like an older-generation game, but playing it doesn't turn my PC into an inferno-in-a-box like Cyberpunk 2077 does.",

While not at all the same mechanically, I get the same thrill playing this game as I did playing Robot Alchemic drive back on the PS2. Its just similar enough for a souls-like fan for me to enjoy, but so much more that its a new and fresh gameplay experience for me. Oh, and fromsoftware's mastery of artistic design + mecha is overkill. These have to be the coolest looking mechs ive seen in a long time. So much so that I actually love the high degree of customization, despite normally disliking this feature in other games because I feel like its inclusion is merely a complex frivolity. Thats not the case in this game. In AC6 i want to make all the coolest looking mecha color combos. While I probably wont go as far as to check out the earlier Armored core titles once I finish this game, I'm glad to have been given such an awesome mecha action experience. \n\nUpdated after completion of first playthrough: This might just be one of the coolest games ive ever played",

I've put hundreds of hours into AC6 and I've replayed it like 5 times, in the middle of another run right now. There are so many ways to play it and you get new content all the way through NG++. It's just challenging enough to not ever be boring. Not as hard as Souls games but you will still die a bit. I can beat things in the game most of the time but a few bosses took me at least one if not two days to beat. The very final boss took me three days and I enjoyed 100% of it, as I said it's never boring. And I haven't even tried pvp yet but I will after I beat this run.\r\n\r\nA 10/10 in my book. You will not regret buying this",

        "review": "As my first introduction to Armored Core, Fires of Rubicon was the equivalent of Sekiro with mecha fights, the difficulty curve is really steep, but heavily rewarding. Needless to say this isn't exactly a deflecting based game like Sekiro, but just like Sekiro, it teaches you everything through gameplay alone, in a way, it can be played as a rythm game, because if you try to fire everything at once, chances are, you miss all shots because you didn't wait for the right moment to retaliate.\r\n\r\nFrom a vast variety of builds, weapons and playstyles, Up until the endgame of my first NG route I was on a mildly \"middle weight\" build that punished me more than I wanted to, and while it would have been hilarious to tank enemies with a heavy build, nothing beats destroying your opponents with huge speed and effective \"gotcha\" weapons.\r\n\r\nA recurring theme for my replaythroughs of NG+ and NG++, is that I've learned how to play the game after I beat it once, you think you've learned the basics, but there's even more things that I either underappreciated, underrated or overlooked because I thought they were not as effective, turns out I was wrong, and I'm glad I was.\r\n\r\nThe humbling experience of adjusting your build to the vast arsenal at your disposal made me enjoy the game a lot, and defeating strong foes never ever felt so satisfying to destroy them just as quickly as they used to destroy me. Gameplay loop is definitely satisfying, and never gets old. This is exactly how you create masterclass gameplay that feels too responsive to your needs (unless you have massive skill issue like I had several times lol)\r\n\r\nHere's hoping FS makes a DLC, because damn this game piqued my interest in the franchise.",

        "review": "If you remotely love the mecha genre this game is for you. Fast paced action set in a universe that's believable and interesting. If you've played the dark souls series this game will feel somewhat familiar. The ability to keep going after you died and redesign your Armored Core after failing to fine tune it for the mission is forgiving enough but not tipping over in terms of integrity of difficulty. This game will kick your ass over and over and over again till you figure out how to deal with certain situations with the right build. Bosses are unique and have different weaknesses to exploit with different ways to go about beating them. Gliding around beating mobs make you feel like a cold blooded bad ass and feels so smooth its like a hot knife cutting through butter. Not to mention the more efficient you get the higher the score you get. Speed, ammo, how many mobs you kill, and how much health you lost are apart of getting a high score so there is a challenge in that. The different builds you can make also create a uniqueness to how you want to play. Tank with big guns? Small and agile? All rounder? or a frankenstien of an AC? You can do it all. You have absolute freedom in how you build you Armored Core and that's fun in itself. Not to mention there are parts to collect and data to collect in almost every mission to unlock even more parts. There are also different missions with decisions that alter your path so that adds replayability considering there is NG and NG+ which also lets you keep the parts you've acquired. Great game all in all, for a 60 dollar game with no major dlcs there are a bunch of hours to sink in 1000% worth it. You won't regret it if you like a challenge.\r\n",

It's a delicate balance I think AC6 has achieved. I have heard that older AC games are even more difficult.\r\n\r\nI held off on buying AC6 despite being excited during the announcement due to my gaming slump. I couldn't keep interested in any game I played and thought gaming was over for me as a hobby... until the steam summer sale. In a little over a hundred hours, I finished all of the achievements. It's rare that a game keeps me engaged and motivated enough for this to happen.\r\n\r\nThis is my first From Software game, and I plan to play Sekiro next.",

The environments are beautiful the soundtrack is amazing and the endless customization and painting options is the icing on the cake. AC6 has fantastic replay-ability between experimenting with different mech builds and looking for special parts or just searching for lore hidden in the maps. Only thing I wish AC6 had personally was Armored Core: For Answer's movement but its just a personal gripe at the end of the day the game is still amazing regardless!",

Other than that, if you are looking for a hard, fast paced, action packed mech game that lets you customise your mech (AC) to your heart's content then this game is for you. Some online reviewers on places like youtube may say that this game lacks a story, they are wrong, it has an amazing story which is just told in an unorthodox way. Via radio and comms channels that characters will use during missions that you will have to pay attention to in order to understand what is going on. There are 3 endings to this game with the 3rd ending being unlocked on your 3rd playthrough of the game. Trust me, each playthrough is worth it, even if you have finished the game once, there is new things the game introduces to you on your 2nd and 3rd playthroughs that have been locked away from you on your first playthrough, so the game still contains a few surprises up its sleeve with new missions and events until you get that 3rd ending which is considered the true ending. So you haven't fully completed the game until you have gotten that 3rd ending and earned the stargazer achievement. This is an amazing game and I'll be looking forward to seeing new armored core games in the future from FromSoftware",

        "review": "[b]Armored Core: The Problem Of Flow™[/b]\n[i]I will be brief 621. I am gonna tell you why despite being such an unique game, Armored Core has a serious flow problem.[/i]\n\nSo yes, Armored Core has a serious flow problem which breaks the fun of the game all the time for me. And it is not just because of the mission based progress in the game. I played Ace Combat 6 too, it is also a mission based game. You're jumping in and out of missions that last mostly 20 to 30 minutes. And i had this problem in Ace Combat too but not like this. \n\nAce Combat 6's missions were fulfilling and when you finish a mission you felt tired so it was nice to stop and relax, buy some upgrades to your aircraft for the next mission. Plus, it's story-telling were better than Armored Core 6. Even in missions there were some interesting interactions between characters, dialogues which you had to listen, you were also given a new quest or new goal in a mission and you had to listen to them because it didnt give you those within the hud or markers in the map/game. So you were not just using a plane and shooting enemies, you had to pay attention to the dialogues to finish the missions. Its missions were engaging and multilayered in this matter. Nice combat + storytelling + extra instructions/directives in missions that require attention from player = fulfilling/satisfying missions. A game that demands your full attention while playing and tires you out. So meta-game was also needed to relax, to take a break and to think about aircraft upgrades. \n\nArmored Core 6 on the other hand, besides having great and difficult (i cant easily say ''satisfying'', i will get to that) combat, has no other engaging features or captivating storytelling in its missions. You are a mercenary going to missions to missions and finishing them. Surely, there's a story but its not connected like Ace Combat 6. Since its written by Fromsoftware, there's no simple story being told directly with every detail. So it can't make you go for the next mission directly to learn the more of the story. That's a problem but it is not a game about story anyway. It is about gameplay. \n\nGameplay also suffers from missions designs. Some missions are really short and you just kill bunch of mechas and than they end. Some of them is last enough (The longest one probably doesn't last more than 15 minutes tho.) but still somehow they too are not satisfying like Ace Combat's missions. They are very linear, you follow the signs in the map, sometimes collect somethings, mostly kill some enemies and beat the boss fights, thats it. They are too linear and *unseasoned* that cant satisfy you. Since it is not a boss rush game (or maybe it is?), it must have more than boss fights. \n\nUnseasoned: There's no engaging interactions or dialogues since you are alone in the missions. You can still finish them even if you don't listen to people talking in your ear. Meaning, you can do them just by following signs in the game. (Maps are already limited in many ways, why the need for markers, i dont understand.) You randomly shoot everything you see and easily reach to the boss fight most of the time. And even boss fights are not that satisfying. Yes they are difficult but with the right build, fights end really fast for the good or bad. Somehow it can not provide that satisfaction from other Fromsoft games' boss fights. \n\n[b]So all we have left are these: Great combat - no captivating storytelling - no multilayered / unseasoned mission designs - no extra directives in missions - lots of limitations in maps - no extra things to pay attention - not much satisfying boss fights (Sorry but i feel this way) = unappealing missions = flow problem / a period of time of thinking about whether or not to take on the next mission + maybe taking a break so long that when you re-enter the game, you propably forgot the controls / how to play. [/b]\n\nCombat is great. And it is exceptionally good and so deep and wide on making a mecha build. It is distinguished in those matters. Still havent tried the PVP, but i think it is a blast too. (I watched a lot of videos on it. All were great.) But the flow problem is solid. And i felt like we should talk about this. So wrote this. \n\nBtw, the soundtrack is fabulous thanks to Kota Hoshino.\n\n[b]- Follow my [url= https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37909124/]curator page[/url] if you like. -[/b]",

        "review": "This game is an incredible experience, with a gripping story that will shatter you emotionally, having multiple endings that will each leave you wanting for more, somehow managing to break your heart without showing a single face even once.\n\nArmored core VI plays like a movie and is the perfect combination between a massive power trip and roleplaying as the victim, with your ass getting handed back to you more often than not. With insane customization options for your mech, custom paint jobs, a complex decal maker and hundreds of different weapons and parts, you’ll spend more time recreating your favourite anime mechs in the garage than inside of actual missions. If you’ve ever wanted to play barbie’s dress up with war crimes, this game is definitely for you.\n\nDespite looking really confusing at first, all the small mechanics in the game are masterfully intertwined and fall into place as you climb up to the ever-rising skill ceiling as new weapons, abilities and parts are introduced. If you manage to get through the journalist filter on the first mission, you’ll be fine.\n\nOverall, armored core VI is insanely good, and I recommend it a LOT to anybody that’s even slightly interested in it. In no time you’ll be hooked on its satisfying and rewarding gameplay loop, with weapons feeling incredibly responsive and every death feeling fair or at the very least, your fault. Whenever you get tired of getting your ass beat in the story, you can choose to play some multiplayer and get your ass handed to you by some broken meta build.\n\nYou have a job to do on Rubicon. Feed the fire, and let the last cinders burn.\n\n\n",

There's so much at stake, so much raw emotion, and such an incredibly dissonant tone that it's hard not to fall in love with this game. There are no throwaway missions or story arcs, and in fact no wasted lines of dialogue. Everything is perfect. Plus, there are 3 different endings, each of which change how some story missions play out, to where each playthrough truly feels like a new playthrough.\r\n\r\nThe worst part of this game is that it's just a little short, especially for a FromSoft game, but that just makes me want more.",

Why you can't even put a cinematic where the mecha fly in the sky or anything.\nTons of parts are in the game you can customize them but you can't loot them on enemies and exploration is empty for the whole first chapter.\n\nReally what year is this? It is like putting a score on the top right of your screen and leaving the player like that thinking \"oh the player will certainly replay the same boring mission 1000 times just to have a bigger stupid score number, there is no need to reward him with more content\"\n\nWould making the maps an open world and having to go to the base yourself, really been that hard to do?\nOn the tech part I can tell you it is easy.\nOn the human part idk how they work but I expected better.\n\nYou can't change the difficulty of the game, so you expect it to be good right?\nWrong of course they spam you with auto aim systems and stupids boss that you kill by spamming dodge button.\nThe worst part is that every boss has the exact same pattern where you press the dodge button when you hear the alert sound.\nIt is really humiliating for a player to be babysitted that much.\nYou pretty much have to play with a naked mecha on purpose to make the game less stupid easy.\n\nWhy is online not even available at the start of the game? Maybe it would be less empty.\n\nDespite all those very very obvious points, fromsoftware leave you with no content update, no sequel, nothing. And every dark soul player will tell you this game is a legendary masterpiece.\n\nto make it short:\n\ntoo easy already finished all the content in max difficulty on the first try, online is dead and gameplay very repetitive\nas expected from fromsoftware\nit was still nice but not worth the price\ngame clearly lack of budget and ambition, battles are too small, content is too small\n\nalso steam doesn't let me review the soundtrack and artbook dlc\nyou are not allowed to listen to the soundtrack and view the arts outside of the game so it doesn't feel like I bought them, I fell stolen about it\nit's sad because the ost were good...\nit doesn't even protect them for piracy anyway since I just have to open the game in unity to extract the archive",

I had never been a mecha fan prior to this (my only reference was Evangelion, but it's kind of its own thing), and it more than convinced me. \n\nCombat is amazing, and the story is superb. Creating different builds and mastering your mechs also feels super good.\n\nLooking forward to the next opus, and would buy a remaster of the first games in a heartbeat.",

Weapons feel unique, and considering the depth of customization there were at least a dozen ways to complete a particular challenge. Although I leaned toward the light build more often than not - so damn fast!\n\nThe game is highly replayable. I had no qualms about playing through the campaign 3 times (NG++),  it allowed  me to uncover the full story and was worth every minute played.",

        "review": "If you're new to mech games in general I'd recommend waiting for a sale, but this is another great Armored Core (AC) installment. The combat is basically ultra-fast paced dark souls in mech suits with more buttons, flight, and dashing instead of rolling. It's not open world so you'll be going back to the garage between missions (which makes sense for how the story / game is structured). I love that they've added plenty of closeup & short cutscenes of your custom mech throughout the game, it really added a lot to the visual appeal of the game and shows off how much love the design / artwork teams put into this title.\r\n\r\nI've noticed a lot more emphasis on melee if the tutorial boss is anything to go by. I've made it to the start of Chapter 2 at this point. The tutorial boss is by far the hardest thing I fought outside of the last boss in Chapter 1, and I probably would have had an easier time with that if I'd adjusted my weapons. Both bosses seem to require an \"up close and personal\" touch, but the tutorial boss took me 5 or 6 attempts since my medium/close preference didn't match with the close & aggressive style needed to take it out. \r\n\r\nOne of the only frustrating aspects to the AC series is the lack of explanation for abbreviations... This can make some things confusing if you're new to AC, or maybe if it has been a while. For instance they say \"MT\", \"forces\", \"units\", etc. without much explanation on what the difference is. You will quickly learn that \"MT\" is going to be something like an AC but a lot weaker but unless you use google there's no way you'll know it means \"Muscle Tracer\" and even then it doesn't really do much to explain anything unless you read a wiki article.\r\n",

        "review": "If it's your first armored core game like it was for me, get it on sale. It's a game that gleefully dances the line between being insanely fun and also being easily the worst PVE balanced game fromsoft has released in the last decade. People who have any amount of time in the game can agree that there is a serious issue with weapon balance while going through the missions. Chapter bosses aren't really memorable (except the 3rd), most are just gear checks to see if you have the right weapons and legs equipped for them and they're only really hard in the first run since after beating them you usually get a new weapon in the shop that memes on the boss you just struggled with and are bad in the other rest of the game.\n\nThe game pretty desperately needed a second tutorial after the first mission for AC building since that's a surprisingly in depth system that if you don't have a solid grasp on will bite you in the ass very quickly unless you're using the god weapons.\n\nThe new game+ is neat but I won't talk about it because I don't want to spoil it.\n\nIt's a game that would have massively benefited from having a free demo of the first 1-3 missions to see if it was going to be something I'd enjoy. It's alright, some aspects of the design are deeply flawed in my opinion and if I knew that going in I'd have waited for a sale, though I personally wouldn't recommend this game to a regular gamer who doesn't know what they're getting into.  The game is a lot to handle and  it won't hesitate to stomp you into the ground  for hours on a single boss and make you spend 40 minutes customising your AC just to have you change your entire build to suite the mission you just failed.\n\nIf I had to compare it to anything, the game is like a pond in terms of depth. The difficulty is surface level and deeply unsatisfying most of the time with few bosses ever requiring knowledge past the surface of \"Build a weapon with good stagger and mash off reload.\" The story is interesting, it has some good depth and requires a few runs to fully get with the branching missions. It's not elden ring deep, but it doesn't have to be and it's good for what it is. For as much depth as I said AC building had earlier, it's just as easy to brute force your way through the entire game in trial and error like old arcade games. My first run of the game was at release with no idea what the meta was developing, but after dying to the chapter 2 boss a few times and switching my weapons frequently, I found that dual shotguns were strong and then never switched off of them for the entire rest of my first run and NG+ despite my AC build not actually even being good.\n\nThere's depth here, but it rarely ever goes beyond the surface. You can purpose build your AC to be the best at using dual miniguns with perfect accuracy within 120 meters and blitz through missions with an incredibly intricate build where every stat means something, or you can just throw together an AC that looks cool and as long as you're using 1 of the 7 best weapons in the game you can just walk through everything anyway despite all your stats being terrible because the weapon balance is just that lopsided.",

        "review": "It's hard to identify anything I like about this game.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, combat doesn't feel good.\r\n\r\nYou have a dodge, but not i-frames. You have shield options, but not perfect parry. Enemy weapons are often rapid fire, or scatter shot. Taken all together this means that you are always getting hit _a little bit_. Using dodges and movement correctly will reduce how much you get hit, but never make you completely untouchable. This results in a feeling that there is no visceral feedback for playing well.\r\n\r\nIn other games with dodging and/or parry mechanics, it \"feels\" very different to avoid an attack correctly vs to fail. But in this game, it always feels the same. You get hit a bit. Always.\r\n\r\nThat's all about receiving damage, but what about giving damage? Well every weapon feels about the same. There's a few different classes of weapon: rapid fire, single shot, explosive etc. but at the end of the day they all amount to \"fling hit boxes at the enemy\". None of it feels _meaningfully_ different. \r\n\r\nWhat about build versatility? This really ought to be a strong point for the game, but it just isn't. While there are very many different components you can buy and stick together, you have to buy every individual piece, and the game is very stingey with money. In order to actually buy enough stuff to have any versatility you'll need to grind out old missions. Repeating the exact same level over and over again, just so that maybe you can buy a gun that has a marginally different ideal range.\r\n\r\nPlot? No idea. This is classic From Software. Huge amounts of vague text hinting at something, but never an indication why I, the player, should care. Random faction is doing random thing against some other random faction. OK, so what? When all the world building is told in this deliberately opaque way, I'm never given a reason to invest in anything or anyone emotionally.\r\n\r\nWhat about the maps and environments? I sure hope you like grey. Every building is grey. It's always snowy. There are lots of different maps, but they all look the same.",

        "language": "english",
        "review": "I have fully finished the game and aquired all achievements. If you value experience take of my review what you will. This is one of few mech games I have played start-to-finish. The others were the old Mechassault series for the original Xbox, and Mecha Knights: Knightmare. I am picky with my mech games. Gundam has not cut it for me for reasons I'll get into briefly. Neither has the new Mechwarrior although it had potential. This is one that does near everything right. I generally disdain PVP-based gameplay so my review lacks any input on that front. The negatives are a shorter list so i'll start with those.\n\n[h2] NEGATIVES [/h2]\n- [u] MOBILITY: [/u] Gravity and Direction of travel should not suddenly cease existing if you get stunned in mid-air, or mid boost. This is a foolish thing. If your mech is paralyzed in every way (including propulsion!), you should fall; or at least keep going in the direction you were moving when stunned. Conservation of momentum is a thing, and I never got over the frustration of this.\n     - I understand the reasoning for the stun mechanic. I do think that avoiding stun in general has made me a better pilot, but it makes for frustrating tactical decisions when myself or an enemy suddenly STOPS MOVING. The mechanic is supposed to be jarring. It is. A bit too much. It is overall a fun mechanic though... [i] QUICK, QUICK, SLOW... [/i]\n\n-[u] RANGE: [/u] I do wish longer range engagements were more viable. Most levels are designed to not need or benefit from it, however I do wish that some weapons had a longer range before deflecting. (Stun needles, long rifles, explosives, etc. Kinetic or otherwise.) Aiming in general is fine, I have no desire for scopes to be included. Range would just make manual aiming more fun and applicable in some missions. Another method of engagement, or flair for your fighting style.\n\n- [u] PARTS: [/u] It would be nice to get all the parts of the PCA mechs and the Institute relics,  or at least the final boss''s mech. More heads are sorely needed. The expressions the faces or light bars really sell some body-head combos. Proportions on some parts seem off bipedal legs specifically. Some are just ugly... even when part of their own set. I like making different mechs with varying \"personalities\". Some parts just don't have a \"fit\". Perhaps it is the extreme proportion change between the torso and legs that throws me, or perhaps the lack of knees. Not sure... not analyzed enough to give better detail.\n\n- [u] GAMEPLAY: [/U] every once in a while it feels as though my input is denied. not always in bossfights, but it primarily occurs during flight. Sometimes it takes more than one click of a key to fire a weapon. The most common occurence is trying to fly after being drained of boost. I will assault boost or hover somewhere, knowing I wont make it in one go. I run out of boost (expected...), but then upon partial recharge, I will be unable to re-hover until the gauge is fully refilled.\n     -Note: It does not happen enough to ruin enjoyment of the game. Don't let this point dissuade you from purchase. This is rare enough that may never happen to most, but is often enough to break immersion when it happens. This seems to be more common during extended play-sessions, & I do play on a laptop that gets hot. However, my machine usually creates graphical issues when overheated, not functional ones. The machine also force-updated itself to Windows 11 so make of this what you will. (Dell Alienware, lots of problems ever since, but not while gaming.)\n\n[h2] POSITIVES [/h2]\n\nWhere do I begin? I fear this game is like Baldur's Gate 3 in that my expectations may not allow room for a lower quality experience.\n\n- [u]  GAMEPLAY: [/u]  Controls are tight. Impact is delicious, controller or not. I use mouse & keyboard b/c it is faster, & more efficient to hit flat, low-profile keys than to pull triggers. Movement in each AC feels natural for its build. Punches are punishing, walking gaits are varied and interesting. The tank is a gutteral bohemoth, while the \"wheelchair\" legs feel like the rollercoaster is about to fly off the rails. The medium-weight reverse-joints add a wonderfully predatory sway to instill terror in lowly MT's. Hitting with the Pilebunker or Laser Lance is extremely satisfying. The gun recoil on some rifles and explosives make you feel like a Badass Mech-Rambo or Schwartzenegger. \n\n- [u] OPTIONS: [/u] The weapons and capabilities are fantastic! You can fly daintily and shit hellfire, be a gliding steel wall, a wheeled whacko with an unhealthy addiction to lead. You could be part of a royal guard, or the Royalty itself. Sometimes I decide to \"fly pretty good for a brick...\" The parts options and room for viability is fantastic. Variability is one thing sorely lacking in the Gundam department. The paint and decal functions are the butter to my bread, Makes me feel like a manufacturer of these machines as well as an expert pilot. Some more symmetrical variants of some heads would be nice.\n\n- [u[ STORY: [/u] There are enough layers to what's going on to feel like you are actually immersed in the universe, but not so many that you lose track of what's going on. The characters are all varied and interesting. Even though you only hear their voice, they end up mattering to you in a way. No sappy sob stories, but there is emotional weight as you go through your missions with \"friends\" on the line. The story is straightforward enough until the third ending. Thought provoking, as morality is grey all the way. Finding & reading all the logs brings interesting depth, as do Allmind's \"logs\" on the arena contestants. \n\n\n[h2] NEUTRALS & NITPICKS [/h2]\n\n- [u] MUSIC: [/u] I am not really sure what to make of others' intense enjoyment of this. I like the intro music. but for the most part, the music fades into the background during gameplay. It is unobtrusive. I prefer it this way, as the focus is on the voices. Replaying missions also becomes less tedious...\n\n\n- [u] AC Test: [/u] Would be cool to able to face more types of enemies here. (Bosses included)\n\nBuy it. Love it. Become Masochistic... You wont regret.",

        "language": "english",
        "review": "To preface this, I should state that I have played and enjoyed all of Fromsoft's Souls titles, but I had not touched Armored Core until this game. Please keep in mind that I am heavily biased towards Soulslike gameplay, and elements of this game that I found satisfying may be unsatisfying to fans of older AC titles and vice versa. Also, I've barely touched PVP so I can't comment on it.\n\nWith that being said, this is one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nThere are very few games that I would call universally fantastic, but this is one of them. I have so few problems with this game, and said issues are so minor that they're easily superseded by the numerous positives:\n\n(The following are in order of personal importance to me; most important to least important.)\n\nGAMEPLAY: The core gameplay of this game is probably the most fun I've ever experienced. I have completed every mission at least 10  times, but I still find myself opening the game and jumping in a mission just to experience the near-perfect combat. I know stagger has been a somewhat contentious mechanic, but I personally love it. Hearing the ever-satisfying ACS Overload noise and deleting a significant portion of the enemy's health bar will never not be addicting to me. Even the simple act of moving around manages to be fun, so the brief moments of travel between mechanical murder are never dull.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION: This isn't just referring to the AC and Emblem customization options, which are both huge pluses for fashion addicts like me, but also build variety. I originally thought I would make one build, then stick with it and ignore most other options. However, unlike most of the Souls games, I actually felt encouraged and rewarded for switching up my build and playstyle when appropriate. The fact that you can sell back parts for 100% of their value means there is essentially zero reason not to experiment, and the vast majority of parts are viable in at least one context. I have 14 builds saved, all of which are fairly distinct from each other, and have managed to beat the final boss using all of them. Some are much more difficult to use than others, but the fact that a slightly above average (if we're being generous) player like myself was able to do such a thing speaks to the fact that almost any build can be viable.\n\nMUSIC: I didn't expect this game's music to be able to match up to Souls music, which, for me personally, it did not. However, this game still has a fantastic soundtrack, and I implore everyone who plays it to pump the music slider up to 10. Most of the level soundtracks lean more towards ambiance, and you probably won't notice them unless you're actively paying attention to them. The boss soundtracks, on the other hand, are absolutely worth a listen. Fromsoft has always been fantastic when it comes to boss music, and this game is no exception.\n\nNARRATIVE: I thought this game would just be Rock'em Sock'em Robots, but I was surprised by how well written it was. The storytelling is much more direct than it is in the Souls games, but it didn't suffer as a result like I thought it would. Most of the characters don't have an incredible amount of depth (With some exceptions that I can't explain because spoilers) but they make up for it by having eccentric personalities and aptly written dialogue. The overarching plot is similar, being relatively simple while having enough cool and compelling moments to remain interesting.\n\nPRESENTATION: This game's art style is brilliant. The corporate machines, wrecked landscapes, and other places I can't spoil never failed to captivate me and make me feel immersed while I shoot people in the face with a shotgun the length of a bus.\n\nAll of these positives are present throughout nearly the entire game. There are maybe two missions that I don't enjoy, and even then I can understand their purpose. Now, for my few cons:\n\nREPLAY VALUE: This doesn't apply to me, as I will never tire of playing random missions and making new builds just for the fun of it, but if that isn't enough to keep your interest, the game doesn't have much to do after your first four playthroughs aside from PVP. You're not rewarded in any way for playing beyond this point, as once you've gotten all the achievements, grabbed all the collectibles, and bought every part, there's nothing to work towards. COAM is completely worthless once you buy everything, so your money counter will climb into the hundreds of millions, only to never be used for anything. I don't really care about this since the gameplay is amazing enough for me to keep playing, but don't expect more than 50-60 hours out of the game if you aren't addicted like me.\n\nS-RANKS: Replaying missions will allow you to be graded on your performance, and one of the achievements requires you to get an S-Rank on every mission. The problem is that the game gives you very little info on how to get S-Ranks beyond \"Go fast and don't screw up.\" A couple missions require you to kill a certain enemy or do a certain thing you wouldn't normally do to get an S-Rank, meaning you can perform excellently on a mission and not get the S-Rank because of something the game didn't tell you about. In fairness, the previously quoted summary does apply to the vast majority of missions, but the few that it didn't were irritating to deal with.\n\nAs previously mentioned, these cons are incredibly minor in comparison to the outstanding positives, and they may not even be an issue for some.\n\nIn short, if you enjoy fast-paced action and think big robots are cool, please buy Armored Core 6. I cannot overstate how much enjoyment this game has brought me and will likely continue to bring me. If this review gets anyone else addicted to funny robot game, I will die a happy man.",

На цьому моменті ти розумієш що досвід у соулсборнах був недаремний :)\r\nФайна оптимізація, графіка, приємний саунд. Дуже велика можливість кастомізації власного меху під будь який стиль гри та нагальні потреби (так, інколи варто перезібратись під конкретну місію)\r\nЗ мінусів - як на мене занадто сильно перекошені важелі складності в сторону босів. Ти проносишься майже без проблем по рівню і потім тобі раптово починають драти дупу, що спочатку неочікувано. Але згодом звикаєш, розумієш що соуслборни дали своє коріння й тут і все стає на свої місця.",

I've never had less fun with a game in my life. It all fells unbalanced from the starting mission to the last (which I couldn't beat). The bosses at the end of each chapter seem to be more unbalanced than the previous. Somewhere in chapter three is when it started becoming a drag to play. I've upgraded my weapon damage, the damage mitigation, and the amount your health packs heal you and it just wasn't enough chapter 4 and 5 bosses are unrealistically hard. They will fly of to the other side of the map before you could finish blinking and absolutely murk you with no time for you to respond. I got lucky and managed to be the chapter 4 boss but it was only luck. I rate this game a 2/10",

This review just feels needed for me now.\n\nMost games you review by story and gameplay but ac6 deserves a third one customization.\nCUSTOMIZATION:\nIf you like to play fast and risky, tanky and slow or anything in between this game has it.\nYour mech customization isn't verry limited you will unlock many diffrent parts where over a long time you will find your playstill. Whatever parts you chose you will be able to complete the game, even if you chose looks over effektivnes. There will be many levels you will have issues with if you stay with your design thoe still your not forced to change anything. All the parts have good balancing for what i saw while playing. I for example used for most of the endgame the second gun you get because it fits my playstill.\nThe hours that you can spend in the picture edit isnt funny. You can change your mechs to the point where you dont know what to do, the detail you can put into these things is just crazy. I created one picture and I was 10 HOURS in that fucking editor.\nGAMEPLAY:\nIt feels like eldenring but you need to be fast, the gamplay is verry fast with you needing to pay a lot of attention. The game is level based with a lot of boss fights. The boss fights are action full with perfect fitting dialog. The more normel parts can be a good reliver before and after boss fights. The game maneges to have a good balence between these two elements except for some shit levels in the end. At times the gameplay can get a bit boring i need to say thoe, specily in the normel sections. The boss fights are legendary I was at the edge of my chair for all of them they are really well done from the gameplay perspectiv and story perspectiv. The end boss is just ass thoe.\nSTORY:\nI was hooked form the start. The storytelling thrue cutseens and gamepaly is so well done with the voiceacting giving it also that specil extra. The game has three endings all being specil and unique. In all the endings I felt so much emotion that i needed that 100%. Talking off the story would take way to long all I can say its beutiful.\n\nI LOVE this game and im sad that i dident find it erlier because the online mode is basicly dead. Every time i do get a match im so happy and filled with joy that i dont even care that i loose most the fact that i could share my love of this game with sombody is all that i needed.\nThis game is beutiful and i will keep playing it till another one comes.",

        "review": "Having never played any Armored Core game before this, I can’t speak to its place in the series. I have put several hundred hours into various Souls games and Elden Ring, Fromsofts other releases you might have heard of. Armored Core 6 shares the bossfight DNA from these fantasy games, as well as the deep character (mech) customization, all wrapped in a Japanese leaning mech style. \n\nThink of a mech character concept, and you can probably build an approximation of it in AC6. Sword swinging, fast dashing melee character? High-flying hover drone with heavy weapons? Gundam replica with laser weaponry? It can all be done in AC to suit whatever playstyle you like. Speed is a huge part of the mech style here though - if you’re into slow moving, ponderous titans from say Warhammer 40k, that’s not really possible given the speed of combat.\n\nThe boss battles are the highlight here, and learning a boss fight is much like learning a Souls boss. Lots of trial and error to learn how to avoid damage, while searching for windows to deal your own. The fights feel faster paced at first, but your own mech is also faster, so after a few hours this becomes a seamless part of the experience. The Bo’s music is very well done, and adds a lot to the setting and heart pounding boss battles - the final boss of chapter 1, Balteus, and his track “Contact with you” is what sold me on the game, I get goosebumps thinking about those first 30 attempts and how fun, challenging and rewarding they were. \n\nI do wish the levels and worlds in between boss fights were a little more fleshed out. There is a little bit of exploration or choice within the levels, somewhat dictated by the type of mech you’ve built and it’s movement abilities, but levels are pretty linear for the most part. This would be fine except that the rooms can feel trivial at times, with little challenge until you reach a named boss enemy or mini boss. \n\nI only tried a little bit of the PvP near launch. Much like Souls PvP it’s extremely difficult, with range control, ammo/cooldown management, and fast reactions being the main draws. It has a small but dedicated player base, but it will take some serious dedication and practice to get competitive at this point in the games life cycle. There are 3v3 team modes, but my sense is the 1v1 duels are what hardcore players play the most. \n\nOverall this is an easy recommendation for fans of Souls games who are looking for something more sci-fi. It’s different enough to feel fresh but at its CORE shares DNA with Fromsofts bread and butter titles.",

        "review": "Not for the faint of heart. Death is a fact of life. Damage is the cost of operation.\r\n\r\nTrue to FromSoft games, skill requirement of this game is extremely high. Newcomers will face a super boss that hits like a truck in the very first mission using inescapable pre-determined equipment. Use this as a gate to make decisions, if you can't beat the first boss in two hours, the game might not be fore you. It's not too late to refund, but you should use everything you learn in that very first mission against this boss. Be aggressive. You have all the tools you need. Watch the boss. Watch your own resources. Range is not your only option. Remember that big damage comes with a big gamble.\r\n\r\nThis game is not an easy game, and it makes a very questionable decision of putting a major road block in THE VERY PROLOGUE. It is a heavy action game while at the same time not brainless. Every decision you make, every part you select makes an incremental impact that culminates into your final mech's, your Armored Core's, performance. Each part has stats, superficial shown at first and in-depth shown when you dig, all transparently displayed. All stats affect how well your Armored Core performs in each regard. While games like Dark Souls allow you to compensate all the stats you lack with skills and extreme reflexes, Armored Core will hit you with reality. There is no such thing as invincibility frames. If your mech is too heavy with armor, and your booster is not strong enough to support your heavy weight, your dash will be too short to get you out of anything. You won't be able to jump to reach enemies high up. If you mech is too light, you will have to brace harder when firing big weapons. If your legs or arms are too scrawny, you won't be able to support your load. Heavy explosives come with large weight. Powerful energy weapons come with hefty energy cost. Think carefully before you bring each part into a mission. Use the right tool for the job. The majority of the time, change equipment will get you through everything.",

For some reason, all mecha games seem to be some sort of turn based/4x strategy and economy simulators. I'm thinking of battletech, into the breach and others. Those games are great, but they're not great because mecha. They're just well designed strategy with mecha theme. However, When I think of GIANT ROBOTS I generally don't immediately think of chess, or how much each arm part costs FIRST. This is what AC6 gets right (as someone new to AC series... yes, I know it's 'been here all along' but it seems previous entries you had to surgically attach extra appendages to succeed) ...In AC6 the combat is real time, fast, satisfying and has the weight of all that souls-borne 'tough-but-fair' combat design experience that makes encounters REWARDING and suitably CRUNCHY. Then, sure, afterwards I'll weigh how much $$ to spend on a new bazooka. Great! Not to hate on strategy or 4x, but it just seems to make so much more sense to me that GIANT ROBOTS BLASTING is first, economy/strategy/deeplore/optimization is second.",

It had a very simple story with some twists to catch you off guard through the different playthroughs. I will say that the difficulty curves hurts the most on the first playthrough and then tampers down with time and then spikes at 2 certain points, no spoilers on that. One thing to note, I will say they could have made the repeated playthroughs more difficult or modified them to make them more worth playing than just a hinderance to the other endings. Fromsoft did a good job and need to give me more of this to enjoy, lest I see where I can get more of this....",

Where the game falls flat, though, is in the fun department as obviously what From Software sees as fun is throwing all kind of overpowered enemies at you and see what sticks. \r\n\r\nThis would be fine in a dark souls game where you have big open maps, can plan your encounters in advance but it totally does not work here in this instanced 5 min run type a thing game. You get your big shiny mech, take it on a mission, kill trash for 2 minutes, encounter a boss kill it and then rinse and repeat. The whole game is just that - bunch of unconnected instances where you dip in do whatever is necessary in increasingly unfair environment and dip out, then do it again and again. Fun? Nah, not to me this shit isn't fun.\r\n\r\nLooking at the achievements it starts strong 99% people beat the first mission and then it steadily drops off to have about 35% of people beating the whole game, of course, looks like im not the only one not having fun here. \r\n\r\nThere is also an arena mode and it's cool and all but meh its more of those 5 min things to do in this game, go out there try your mech and do it again with the next guy.\r\n\r\nThinking about it, there is also story but somewhere in 3rd chapter i just started skipping it, as it's bunch of nonsense about coral, about some bitch living in your head AYRE which you get after defeating some missile boat boss. It's all nonsense. \r\n\r\nThe core is there but the fun is not, literally a shiny turd is what this game is. Damn shame, could have been something good.",

They provide more dialogue and character interaction than other FromSoft games, though.\n\nMultiple routes and endings make repeat playthroughs worthwhile, with only a few missions being stupidly hard unless you have the right gear.\n\nCombat is fun but can be a button-mash fest as you spam all weapons constantly against certain types of enemies, without much thought to dodging. The fights that do force you to learn are all fun and rewarding, and there are plenty of them.\n\nVisual effects can be a bit much at times, as your screen can get covered with blue lasers and explosions, leaving you unable to see anything other than the HUD. However, for the majority of the game, all weapon effects look incredible.\n\nMaps are good but are recycled a lot. You'll find that many missions use the same levels you've already done, but this time you're starting at the end and going to the beginning. It doesn't take away from the enjoyment, but it would have been nice to see original levels instead.",

        "review": "It's out the gate very fun and fast pace, I sat there and designed my own decal, painted and everything so I could really get into it. I was happy with everything until I started to notice the lack of weapon variety. I don't like having melee only be on the left hand, makes me kind of sad I could't duel swords or lances. The story felt very....boring to me. I didn't really feel invested in any characters at all, it all seemed pretty shallow. Also the story was short, way shorter than I had expected. Visually I loved it all, music was blood pumping and fun. I jammed out to it a lot. The biggest issue is by the end I was looking for more weapons to use, most were pretty meh or almost the same with a slight difference. I did end up an energy build though and using the low lvl laser rifle with the aoe plasma rifle for when they stand still for big damage with LR back units being the plasma launchers. Most of the game was pretty easy until 240 second phase and ayre. Those are the only 2 times I felt like I actually had to try hard like in Dark souls. Not a bad experience but was short and.....left longing for more for what I paid. almost 2 days worth of fun was kinda expensive. Maybe I'll waste the time doing it all again for 1 different choice to get a new cut scene ending, but I doubt it will be worth it.",

Gundam was cool and I had some interest in other games, but Armored Core is what I really like about Mechas. Hard, sharp, brutal designs for war machines that you can color pink and purple. This game has been my favorite Fromsoft title in recent memory and I have been playing it nonstop for a while now. It is very thoughtful, fun, and downright horrifying at parts. Gunning for the 'Alea lacta est' ending was one hell of a challenge, but was well worth it for the conclusion to this cinematic, phenomenal game. Highly recommend it. One of few games I spent an entire shift listening to a 5 hour lore video on.",

I have greatly enjoyed other much older games such as the Zoids Versus series for the Nintendo Gamecube, which used a similar yet more clunky version of the combat system that is perfected in this game. Running it on the steam deck makes it even more incredible. Customization is integrated into the strategies needed to progress in the game. I am also enjoying the new surprises that come up in the new game plus, and looking forward to more!",

I decided to take a leap of faith as a FROMSOFT fan who has played all of the souls games. \n\nQuite enjoyable with great visuals. I would 100% recommend this game if you wanted to try something new and enjoy a laid back type of game where you go pew pew and not use your brain too much. Tons of guns and different types of builds. I went with laser build with the laser lance melee which is just perfection along with huge laser shot guns on my back with a coral / plasma rifle. Just perfect. I played around with a really fast blaster pistol build also but wasn't as strong. \n\nI didn't realise its one of those the game plays out differently when you reach NG+ reminds me of NIER. There is enough new gear and missions sprinkled in to keep you interested so i decided to just go all in and experience all 3 endings (Including the true end in NG++) The main story is quite short honestly. Took me about 10 hours to be NG. So going for NG++ helped the game last longer. \n\nOverall i would gladly recommend the game but i would not advise buying this game for full price. Its just too expensive for what you get. This is a no brainer buy when its on sale.",

        "review": "Brilliant. Gameplay is mech meets 6-7 gen movement shooter meets gunz with a dash button and flight. It's extremely fast. It is also a Fromsoft action-adventure game, and brilliant as that too but I don't want to spoil to much. It shares a place with Doom Eternal on the next level of shooters, and may in fact be better than DE even as a combat game (it's fromsoft, the \"campaign\" is incredible and has some of the best bosses I've ever fought and an amazing story too but again Spoilers), all while being a Third Person Shooter and not a FPS\r\n\r\nCustomizing your mech is almost as fun as building your dark souls character. Let your gun-pla loving inner child rejoice as you spam as many missiles as possible onto a big crab monstrosity with a tiny head and then fly around and vomit explosions on everything. (Or you could be like, a big mech guy with a sword, IG)\r\n\r\nTruly revolutionary and one of the games the next generation of Masters will be building on. Lots of new weapon and encounter design I've never seen before here. Pick it up if you are a Fromsoft, Shooter, or action-adventure-platformer fan, Game Designer, or anyone obsessed with the medium.\r\n\r\nAs an armored core or mech fan, it depends on how much you like fast mechs, as these mechs are big, but very, VERY fast and the controls are much more like a typical video game than typical mechsim, or previous AC games. It is also either a story Reboot or veeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyyyy far in the future. However there's still lots of mech goodness with power boosts, big steppin'. giant swords, Crazy Pilots(Yes Raven), Space factions dueling it out, and ridiculous missile barrages that seem to fill the whole sky. Oh, and collateral damage. Lots'a that.\r\n\r\nAlso as a Fromsoft Fan yet more proof people other than miyazaki there are masters of the craft too.\r\n\r\nTo Fromsoft, Thank you, for another amazing world to Explore. This game was close to perfect and shows it's depth masterfully. It's Really Hard Though! I love it, thank you all for all your hard work.",

The narrative is very immersive with a great sound track which kicks up a notch at the right places (boss fights). The combat is exhilarating.. another solid addition from the FromSoftware team; well done!!! 9.5/10",

Great story, highly replayable, the bosses can get a little difficult but surprisingly tame compared to FS' other bosses, an incredible experience overall.\r\n\r\nThe PVP however has a lot to be desired; poor balancing, unoptimal netcode, and meta that favor the extremes and specialized builds. You'll most likely meet a similar build multiple times in higher ranks, and skill expression is nearly nonexistent since aiming is automated, and most movement options are isolated and somewhat limited (Talking from 400+ hours of double melee PVP grind).\r\n\r\nHighly recommended for the Single-player content. PVP, not so much, unless you're a masochist.",

As a long time AC fan, this game does an amazing job at capturing what made us fall in love with the games while introducing new mechanics, new concepts, and new experiences.  Stunning visuals, a story that makes you think and feel, and you get to enjoy it all while piloting 4 story tall mechs, with enough customization to suit any play style.\n\nTo address the gripes of some long time fans - yes.  It introduces Dark Souls style boss mechanics.  There is a dodge system.  There is a sword.  There is stagger.  True fans of the series know how these games have evolved through each iteration.  This is not AC4A.  This is a new generation of Armored Core game. \n\nTo new fans: Welcome, and I sincerely hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.  \n\nTo FromSoftware: Thank you.  All I ever dreamed of was another entry into this series.  And I couldn't be more thrilled.\n\nTo Elden Ring: Thank you for being such an amazing game, and selling so many copies, that it led to the development of AC6.\n\nTLDR: Solid 9/10 game, stunning release by FromSoftware as always.  Mech fans, AC fans, Elden Ring fans, Dark Souls fans, and enjoyers of challenging, rewarding gameplay will all have a good time with this one.",

        "review": "AC6 is a perfect example of a game that makes me wish for a \"mixed\" recommendation, because it has very much been a mixed bag for me. I will also preface my thoughts by mentioning that I have not played any other AC title, nor do I have much experience with mecha games in general. I bought this game based on Fromsoft's pedigree and the intriguing premise.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing that was apparent to me even from the reveal trailer, is that the game has a fantastic art style. Although Rubicon is a rather bleak world (being basically an icy wasteland), it is nonetheless consistently impressive to behold with its abundance of dizzying megastructures that feel like they might well reach into the atmosphere. I frequently stop and think about the environments from a human scale and it does often feel downright comical just how big these buildings are, but without knowing more about the setting I can suspend my disbelief and simply buy that, in this setting, we have the technology to easily construct continent-sized structures. It certainly makes for cool environments.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think I would have appreciated occasional glances at the world from an actual human viewpoint to help put the scale of the mecha action into perspective. Maybe walking sections would have been out of place, but cutscenes could have benefited here - even just seeing 621 talk to Walter in the hangar face to face, or from a console, would have been cool. Or seeing humans in the actual levels, running away from the action or even making futile attempts to fight back. Future Cop LAPD had you trample human criminals with your police mech, great fun and underlined the might of your war machine well.\r\n\r\nThe music in the game is serviceable, though it hardly stood out to me. I literally just finished the game and I cannot recall a single melody. It's all very subdued sci-fi background noise as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nSolid voice acting and mostly solid writing with a, I'll call it a serviceable story. I can appreciate that I have only seen 1 out of 3 endings so the nuances will surely elude me, but having done one playthrough (Fires of Raven ending) and reading what lore the game offered me, I get the general gist of it all but I struggle to feel really invested in any of it. It's all very grand-scale concepts (the inhumanity of war, the extremes of corporate greed, the exploitation of nature), mixed with some distinctly sci-fi magic elements (with Coral being a wonder resource that is both a seemingly infinite energy source, as well as a sentient hivemind entity). But, similar to what I mentioned earlier, I miss the human perspective. Players develop something of a rapport with Ayre (one of the \"ghosts\" in the Coral), but at no point are we given an iota of personality from 621, nor do we ever see a face. We're hardly given appreciable motivations for why people do what they do. There's some backstory in the arena profiles for AC pilots, but it is so, so meaningless when you just expose it in 2-3 sentences in an optional text blurb.\r\n\r\nIn short, I really miss the \"human\" element in the story. Mechs are cool, grand concepts are cool, but all of this needs to be grounded in a way that makes it relatable to human scales and human feelings. I will add that, I think, this is a deliberate approach by Fromsoft since these symptoms are rampant in their other games (chiefly, their Souls and adjacent titles), and I'm not a fan of it there either. Elden Ring's story would hit much harder if they made me care about the Tarnished and their relationship with the denizens of the Lands Between, and the same can be said for AC6. It is so difficult to care about a silent protagonist who operates in a world of half-truths and omissions, interacting with forces and concepts well beyond human scale. The building blocks for a gripping experience are here, but the mortar that binds it all is absent - deliberately so.\r\n\r\nThey don't want to do this, so at the end of the day I'm left with an impression of \"Coral is kinda cool I guess\" and \"wowzers, those sure were some nice explosions!\", yet craving that satisfying feeling I get after, say, finishing Deus Ex: Human Revolution, or a Witcher game - stories that actually have something to say about the human condition, beyond providing spectacle and world-endangering crises.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the gameplay, I will say that the pacing of content is also short of satisfying. I'm just not a big fan of piecemeal, instanced missions that take 5-10 minutes, then booting me back into the hangar (especially when it makes no narrative sense at all in later missions). The world feels surprisingly small because of it, in spite of the vast scale it promises through its graphics. This is further reinforced by the heavy reuse of maps from various angles and with various enclosures, making it feel like the game is really taking place in ~5-6 relatively small locations tops.\r\n\r\nThe placement of fights in the arena is perhaps the biggest offender in terms of pacing, though. I was stuck for 3 chapters on one of the \"weakest\" enemies - Maeterlinck. Took me, I dunno, 20 or 30 attempts to beat that bitch. But every enemy before her, I beat in one try. Every enemy after her, I beat in 1 or 2 tries (the ninja-inspired mech took 3). She is such an anomaly in her placement. Should have been at the #1 spot if you ask me, not 5th from the bottom.\r\n\r\nI also feel that the arena was a lackluster inclusion, conceptually. Wouldn't it be more interesting to maybe talk to these characters and build a rapport before fighting them? Furthermore, some of the arena foes you do fight in actual missions. Don't see a good reason to fight them early in the arena, or rematch them here later (except maybe as a sort of VR boss rush gauntlet mode for people who want it). Just seems strange as a game element, as if they had all these mech fights planned out but no time to actually put them into real missions, so they just dumped them all into a list of generic arena fights.\r\n\r\nLastly, and I admit that this is entirely based on my own preferences, I was just not a fan of the general gameplay conceit that your build determines victory or defeat before combat even begins. That might be a little extreme, and I'm sure people beat all kinds of bosses with all kinds of builds, but it is generally true that the difference between bringing the \"right\" build and not, is the difference between beating a boss easily in 1-2 tries or beating your head against a wall for hours or days on end.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't really like the experience of discovering that the next roadblock boss just straight up counters every weapon I've got equipped and now I need to figure out which of the dozens of weapons and hundreds of combinations is the \"good\" loadout to just beat it without trouble. For the final boss I just googled the solution online, found the \"meta\" build, used it and, sure enough, won in 2 tries.\r\n\r\nNot saying that's necessarily a bad feature, but it's a particular taste - and it ain't mine.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would say my time with the game alternated between decent and mediocre, depending on my current frustration level. Some of the narrative things I wished the game had were neglected, whilst its core gameplay brought me middling enjoyment at best, or frustration at worst when it gets hard. The game's difficulty in general is very much a pendulum that swings between \"trivially easy\" and \"CBT\" with little rhyme or reason (see the Maeterlinck example).\r\n\r\nEven so, AC6 carries the quality standard that Fromsoft is known for, and I'm sure that people who do enjoy the customization and adaptation aspect of this kind of mech game will have a really good time with it. Just because it wasn't all that for me, doesn't mean that I don't recommend the game on those grounds. Decide for yourself if the game's design principles, as well as its strengths and weaknesses, appeal to you or not.",

        "review": "\r\n[h1] Overall Review [/h1]\r\nHigh quality game all around. Beautiful graphics, excellent sound design, and a perfect sense of scale. The game offers much more than you would expect, including a base game, a New Game +, and a New Game ++ all with unique and engaging content. Well worth $60, with very few flaws.\r\n\r\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\r\n\r\nLike what you would expect from a FromSoft game, the core gameplay loop heavily revolves around combat, which is done immensely well. The excellent sound design and graphics come together to make every hit feel weighty and fitting for a battle on a mecha-scale. (Nothing feels better than landing a solid, deep cutting melee attack.) Gameplay is very smooth, and every combat is a puzzle that can either be brute forced with skill, or made a little easier with the right build.\r\n\r\nAgain, true to FromSoft fashion, this game shines the most in its boss battles. Most bosses pose a unique challenge that will either require adaptation, skill, or both to overcome. Luckily, the game makes it very easy to adapt to bosses by making the in game store have a 100% refund rate, allowing you to just sell your current build and swap to one you think will be more fitting at no cost to your progress.\r\n\r\n[h1] Storyline [/h1]\r\n\r\nIn terms of story, this game really isn't meant to be about the story. It's a game all about being in a giant mech and kicking ass, are you really here for an in depth and captivating storyline? If you are, you won't be disappointed. The plot and characters are simple on their surface, but paying attention to notes and dialogue will reveal a good amount of intrigue. If you allow yourself to become invested, some of the story decisions to be made throughout the game will be truly heart wrenching and emotionally impactful. Furthermore, many mysteries of your first playthrough are expanded on and explained throughout NG+ and NG++.\r\n\r\n[h1] Bonus Features [/h1]\r\n\r\nTrue to it's origins, Armored Core 6 has robust multiplayer and cosmetic options. You can customize the appearance of your Core down to very fine details, color, decorations, and shininess.\r\nYou can also pit your mechs off against your friends 1v1 or in 3v3 battles. There is also an online competitive arena, but as I haven't gotten into it yet, I will not comment. Point is, if you want to battle your friends and look good doing it, this game has you covered.\r\n\r\n[h1] Criticism [/h1]\r\n\r\nWhile this game is very good, it isn't perfect, and I have two minor complaints.\r\nFirstly, about 20 percent of boss fights take place in arenas that seem large, but are actually enclosed rather tightly by invisible walls. In a game all about mobility and dodging incoming projectiles, hitting these walls not only sucks due to their immersion breaking effects, but also because you are going to get hit by the ~30 or 40 missiles you were trying to dodge when you slammed into that wall. It also really doesn't help when the bosses themselves are allowed to go outside of and attack you from beyond those walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] [VERY MINOR SPOILER AHEAD] [/b]\r\n\r\nEven more unfortunately, the tutorial boss suffers the most from this flaw. The first boss you face during the game is a large helicopter, and as you'd expect with FromSoft, just because it's a tutorial boss, doesn't mean it's going to be easy. As a new player it poses a decent challenge, but the biggest challenge is in just how much time it will spend camping outside of the invisible arena walls barraging you with missiles. If you don't want to spend more time than you have to just to start the game, I recommend learning to hide from the helicopter when it does this in order to force it back into the playable area.\r\n\r\n[b] [MINOR SPOILER END] [/b]\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are A LOT of numbers and statistics to keep track of when assembling your mech, many of which are not explained in any tutorial. It can be confusing when you are trying to assemble the mech that you want, but keep hitting limitations that you don't understand, and remain unexplained. My recommendation is to do one of the following:\r\nA: Spend some time using the \"Give context\" feature in the mech assembly area in order to get a grasp on what the numbers actually mean.\r\nB: Make use of premade builds and then tweak them to your needs \r\nC: Watch a youtube tutorial explaining how AC design limitations and features work.\r\n\r\n",

        "review": "Fantastic AC game. I've played since the original came out in 97, with most of my time spent on 3 and 4, and this is probably my favorite. As long as you know and are comfortable the mechanics, the game is only as hard as your build makes it. YouTube is full of build help videos for those new to the series or those finding it difficult. They've also taken a note from Elden Ring and made each mission super open so it gives this grandiose feeling to each map. I guess my only complaint is that the 1v1 arena mode is really bland and comes off as little more than a way to test builds against different NPC ACs. Older titles had you fight in an actual arena with set pieces (a giant lifted highway over a little colony town, for instance) to hide behind, in, under etc. This is just an open space in what seems to be a VR arena or something. Just flat and boring.\n\nBesides that, If they continue with this design direction, I will continue to throw money at them.",

It takes a while to unlock all the good stuff but it gives you a constant sense of progression and skill. Boss fights can be tough but it's much easier to tweak your builds to get a better result with some experimentation. Definitely my favorite AC game.",

FromSoft incorporated many elements from the Souls series in this iteration, which is to the game's benefit. The combat was exhilarating, the musical scores were magnificent, and the story was engaging. I'm looking forward to future titles in the series being just as Souls-Core in nature. \n\nTreat yourself to this experience. You deserve it, Raven.",

        "review": "Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon is my first introduction to the series and also to mech games. It is a wonderful game, tons amount of fun. The very first mission, while frustrating for absolute beginners like myself, is a great way to show what is to come, what future missions will be like.\n\nHalf of the time when playing this game, you'd be busy building your mech, your AC, finding parts that fit your playstyle and what fits the situation. You can't put everything into one basket; you can't equip all best parts into one AC. Building an AC requires compromises. High output damage forces you to equip slow mobility. And I like that feature. It makes you think more and come up with something to make up for the compromises.\n\nThe difficulty in the game is not linear; it doesn't go easy to hard from first mission to last. The first chapter is already very difficult and a huge wall (heh) to overcome. The difficulty is scattered; you'll get a hard mission, then an easy one, then another easy one before coming a harder mission. It is almost unpredictable, though I guess that goes pretty well with the theme of the game: \"Expect the unexpected\".\n\nI have no interest in the PvP arena, but that brings the attention to the fact that there is no official Co-op mode. You are paired with NPCs in a few missions yet you can't play missions with your friends together. I feel like this is a missed opportunity.\n\nOverall, it is a great game with a heartbreaking storyline, very much expected from FromSoftware!",

By far the best in the entire series as it manages to put together all elements of every nuance from prior installments.

S ranking is only possible on \"mission replays\", so in total you need to play the same f*cking sh*t 4 times. including the annoying mini-cutscenes which you can't skip (the ones in-between the cutscenes you CAN skip). On top of that, you have to be careful you don't accidentally click a wrong mission, because then you can lock yourself out of some missions. Bad and unfun design.\n\nThe first playthrough was a bit of fun, but in NG+ it started to feel like a clicker game where you don't really do anything besides go through the levels while spamming all mouse buttons.\n\nGame would be a lot better off with a single playthrough and more stategic requirements for each level, which is what I was hoping for, but bruteforcing simply works so why bother?",

My only slight complaint is it not having the customization of the older games I've watched YT videos of, which was\"dream made reality\" system imo.",

There is very little negative I have to say about this game, as it is a good sequel that improves and expands on the predecessors. Thankfully Fromsoft left souls mechanics out of the game for the most part showing that they can still make good games completely separate from souls. The sheer amount of build variety was one of the big selling points, and it does not disappoint. If you become stuck in any part of this game, you are encouraged to try different parts or weapons and can sell back any parts for a full refund instead of beating your head against the wall for hours. In addition to this, the game is full of varied missions, enemies, and bosses that offer both spectacle and challenge. If that wasn't enough, there are alternate missions and completely new missions to be unlocked in the first two new game plus cycles. The soundtrack does have many forgettable tracks for the basic missions, but the major parts of the game have genuinely impressive electronic music.",

        "review": "If I had to assign a Game Of The Year for 2023, this would be it. For anyone who has never played a mech game, this would be the one I recommend. It controls exceptionally well and has great gameplay to match it, putting it leagues above any other mech game for the most part. The visuals are, to be frank, the best I have seen out of a game, the only other contenders I could think of would be God of War (2018). The environments match the graphics, being incredibly diverse and deep in their construction.\n\nRegardless, despite how FUCKING BEAUTIFUL this game is, it runs incredibly well even on low power devices. As well, the way each person plays the game will be different, with customization that has lead me astray for hours just building cool designs or making something more fun for me to play, like a melee focused build. \n\nThe missions in the game, and the story as a whole, is subtle but well crafted. By the end of some endings (there are multiple), I was either screaming with joy or on the verge of tears. The characters were surprisingly interesting as well. The story, or at least one play through of the game isn't very long at all, being 20-30 hours, even if there are 3 separate endings you can play through (each of which go through different missions and diverge). \n\nWhen I am not playing this game, I am thinking of playing this game. Don't even get me started on some of the songs on the unique but great soundtrack of the game. Also, I've never properly experience a bug or crash since I got the game, so there's that.\n\nTLDR: Expect boss difficulty spikes and be prepared to spend potential hours trying to best one boss. Otherwise, the game has incredible gameplay, story, visuals and is just genuinely fun.",

No poor optimization, no bugs (as far as I know), and quite a bit of stuff to do. Really good story, the game looks beautiful, and the customization is super in depth yet relatively easy to understand. Combat is amazing and fluid with such a wide variety of weapons and parts at your disposal. Each boss fight is super unique and cool, and to top it off, the game is very challenging. But don't let that discourage you, this game is a masterpiece. \r\n\r\n10/10 - 100% worth the money",

Then it will throw a boss that requires you to quit the mission, change your whole build by selling and buying new parts, to then fight all the way back to that boss, just to die again. The missions are terribly paced. 1 mission was actually 3 minutes of killing a few mechs. The next mission was dodging orbital lasers for 10 minutes then fight a boss.\r\n\r\nMost of the boss enemies don't feel like they take skill to fight. Their weapons will always track better than yours. Their barrage of wide area hit boxes with projectiles moving faster than the lightest frame. It feels hard for the sake of being hard. I constantly feel compelled that once I've taken enough damage to just restart checkpoint. One because after you die, the \"ally\" people will always mock you for 20 seconds while you just stare at your corpse waiting for the Game Over screen. Second is because after a certain amount of damage, with so many spam attacks being unavoidable, you need a minimal amount of health by 2nd or 3rd phases of bosses, less you just die anyways and waste more time. \r\n\r\nYou can only swap gear after dying and waiting for your allies to tell you how you just can't beat this enemy. I didn't even realize you could reassymble (but not buy) gear after death because waiting for the Game Over took so long.\r\n\r\nYou will be restarting checkpoint a lot and never in a good place. Often having to fly 10 seconds to restart the fight you just died to and skip the cutscene. The narrator people will badger the hell out of you and with nothing useful. Reminding of that annoying fairy in Zelda. \"Be careful, he's strong\" as you fight a 20 story robot. Or my favorite \"Your frame is damaged\" as if I didn't see the un-dodgable melee attack take half the health of my heaviest build.",

You do the bidding of your handler, Walter, and are participating in this war going on for a resource on the planet called Coral. Coral apparently caused a catastrophic event called the Fires of Ibis which burned the entire planet and surrounding star system 50 years ago. All the Coral was thought to be burnt up until it is detected on Rubicon again years later and corporations rush to be the first to seize it. There are different factions warring over this resource and the missions will have you taking the side of a faction in one, and then fighting against that same faction in the next. You have almost no loyalties and do the bidding of whoever will pay the most for your service. It's an interesting concept switching sides so often in a game as that is usually never the case so I did find that aspect interesting.\n\nThe problems begin with the game's horrible lack of explanation for things. What is Coral? How exactly does it work? Well, even after finishing the game you will be left guessing because it never explains what exactly it is at all other than it is some sort of energy source that allowed humanity to rapidly advance. It never explains how it is flammable, what caused the Fires of Ibis, what \"Ibis\" even is, or anything like that. It makes things even more confusing when you come into contact with some Coral and start to hear this voice in your head from then on. According to the subtitles the voice is someone named Ayre and she speaks to you on missions and in the hangar; calling out enemies and giving you directions. After finishing the game and still not getting a sensible explanation for who exactly she is, I looked it up on the Wiki and apparently she is a disembodied Rubiconian, which is just a person from Rubicon. HUH??? That makes zero sense. That's like saying if you smell diesel fuel you can speak to your dead grandmother. Who the hell thought this was good lore? It makes even less sense that she gives you enemy callouts and directions since how do you know where all these enemies are without a physical body that has, you know, EYES??? How are you seeing this and talking to me? Who thought this made sense? When people die on Rubicon do they somehow become part of the Coral? Is it made from human souls? The world will never know because THIS GAME IS PISS POOR AT EXPLAINING THINGS. I feel like this is a common problem in FromSoftware games where the gameplay is cool but the story just absolutely makes zero sense. It's like instead of having many cohesive thoughts that all interconnect, they just throw a bunch of random story elements together and consider it a well though-out, finished story, which it is not at all. You are not given any reason to care at all about the planet Rubicon or any of the characters and the largely mediocre voice acting doesn't help. It is such a shame too because visually, Rubicon is one of the coolest looking locations I've seen in a game. I LOVE megastructures and this game reminded me so much of BLAME!. I really wanted to get into it story wise but there just really isn't anything there to get into. It's pretty disappointing. Overall the story is poor and needed a lot more thought put into it and time developing it. Oh, and there are also 3 different endings so you will have to replay the game THREE DIFFERENT TIMES in order to see all of them (at least you keep all the mech parts and stuff you unlocked).\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is the better part of the game. Japanese and Western takes on mech games are very different. Western mech games often focus on mechs being slow, hulking machines with hard hitting attacks, while Japanese mech games are usually much more Gundam-like, with fast paced combat and high movement speeds. FromSoftware, being Japanese, made this game in the latter fashion. The combat is very addictive and in my opinion is the strongest part of the game. It's satisfying and fast paced and you have many different weapons to choose from that all really do feel different. It's fun to customize your mech and they give you lots of ways to do so, which I appreciate. I like how the different legs really affect how your mech handles. You can choose from bipedal (jack of all trades), reverse joint (can jump really high), tetrapod (can hover in the air), and tank (slower but has high health). I don't think I've played a mech game where your choices made your mech actually feel extremely different to play so I like how that was done. There is even a Black Ops 2 style emblem creator so you can make your own custom emblems and put them on your mech or set one as your pilot emblem. I also like that none of the customization options are locked behind a paywall. There are NO MICROTRANSACTIONS in this game, which I really appreciate.\n\nThe levels do have some issues. For example, the pacing is terrible. In the very first mission you have to fight a hard boss before you have even gotten a chance to grasp the controls of this game. It's not just an easy throw-away boss fight either, it's actually decently difficult and I can see it being frustrating and off-putting to new players. I do like how it sets the tone for the game, that this place is out to kill you, but there is no excuse for placing such a hard boss in the literal TUTORIAL level. I feel bad for those playing this on console because it is even harder to deal with the boss (and really just everything in this game) on a controller. If you end up getting the game, mouse and keyboard is definitely the way to play. Anyways, the tutorial throws the pacing way off since the next few missions are easy and can be considered a joke compared to the boss fight so it just feels like the events are very out of order. The game is also separated into 5 different Chapters, with some of them being long and containing lots of missions while others are extremely short. For example, Chapter 2 only has 3 missions in it while the next Chapter has 12. All of these issues contribute to the pacing just feeling odd and you don't really get a good sense of how far along you are in the story due to them.\n\nI also wish there was more multiplayer functionality. You can fight other players but there is no way to do co-op on missions, no PvE mode, or anything like that. It's a shame since the combat is the strongest part of the game and it would be fun to do it with others in more ways than just the one.\n\nAlso, why is the maximum FPS only 120? FromSoftware is aware that monitors above 120 hertz exist, right? Come on guys it's not 2011 anymore, this is unacceptable in 2024.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI would probably give this game a 6.5 out of 10. The combat is good, but the story is so bad there's no way to care about the combat outside of it just being satisfying to rain down missles on things. The game has some serious issues that make it to where I can't really recommend it, despite it also having some good going for it. I guess if you don't care about story and just want big robot go brrrr then get it and you will have fun, but if you need a good motive/story to get behind a game and to care about the world you are entering in to like I do, I would stay away.",

It feels like a FromSoftware game without feeling like a soulsborne game, in my opinion. The challenge is just right and, coming straight here from Shadow of the Erdtree, the mission-based gameplay was a breath of fresh air. The game was the perfect length for me, clocking in at around 20 hours for the first playthrough and 28 to get all the endings. You really can't go wrong picking this one up, and FromSoftware is an exceptional developer in this current era so I feel they deserve all the praise we can heap on them.",

        "review": "The BEST Mech Hardcore Action from From Software.\n\nWhat I like from This Armored Core is building and armed your AC (the mech, called Armored Core), not just body parts, but also the inner machine like FCS (CPU for attack), Generator, booster, making AC that suit your playstyle was more unique than other mech game.\n\nThe game can be challenging in some way, but if you lose you can re-assembly your AC that suit on current battlefield, making Observe-Learn-Adapt was important aspect in building and controlling AC on battlefield.\n\nArena was very important, not just for winning againt AC Opponents in Arena, but the only way to get OS points to upgrade AC system (additional & passive abilities)\n\nI was afraid this game was way too difficult as this game made by From Software, which developer also made famous Souls series like Elden RIng & Dark Souls. But SURPRISINGLY I'm able to play this game with ease And ENJOYING mech battle.",

The Miyazaki touch - just elevates it to an abstract enjoyment. \r\n\r\nIt is a more user friendly version of the previous games, ushering in a new genre of armored core addicts. And that's fine with me. The game will still challenge you a plenty, Especially like me if you try and play Mouse and Keyboard and dont use auto lock. User error here. Some enemies are so fast you have no choice but to rely on this mechanism and even then you may still drop lock. \r\n\r\nThere's multiple modes and many ways to customize the mech.

But what you  don't know is that the campaign is so immersive, and the characters and voice acting so well done... I was really impressed by the simple yet really well performed script. Sound department and dialogues, is what ultimately got me hooked and let me fell in love with the game and just let me want to go back home after work, in a dark room, immerse in the world and atmosphere and general feel. \r\nIf anyone is hang up on buying this, don't be, it is a really good purchase... besides please show publisher we love it cuz I'm eagerly gonna wait for a sequel :}\r\n",

        "review": "TLDR: its really good\r\n\r\nAnyways,\r\nA few years ago, before this game came out I decided to play the old Armored Core games because I had a craving to play some \"mech games\" and they didn't really grab me, though I saw the appeal and I had some fun for a while. When Fromsoft said that they wanted to do things other than soulslikes after Eldin Ring, I started getting hyped because I was really hoping they'd take all the experience working on action games and apply them to the Armored Core IP, and I ended up actually being right.\r\n\r\nThere is some DNA from other Fromsoft games here and it serves the game well. The laser swords are not only usable but fun to use, and the stagger system leads to a lot of hype moments in combat. While a lot of people love the combat of the old games, I prefer this faster style of combat.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of people say this game is too easy, but I think the difficulty is pretty solid. There is a lot of weapon variety and they are all viable if you can integrate them into a build properly, and I much prefer this to the old games where it felt like half of the arsenal was kind of junk but maybe that's just a skill issue on my part. Honestly I wonder if a bunch of people are looking up OP meta builds to play this and that is where the difficulty complaints are coming from. I found my first playthrough to be very challenging, the second one was much easier, and the third one was the easiest save for the end, though I think this has to do with a combination of getting better at building decent mechs and just getting better at the gameplay.\r\n\r\nAlso the industrial megastructure aesthetic is awesome and I just wanted to say that.\r\n\r\nAC6 is probably the best mech game I've ever played buy it if you want to play a good mech game.",

Fluid controls, responsive movement that doesn't take away from the scale, combat with real impact, and a huge amount of customisation options that can change the way you play and approach the game. I can't think of another game within the last decade or two that even begins to approach the atmospheric design in AC6. The writing is excellent while staying lean and unobtrusive, and the voice acting is superb. If you enjoy singleplayer experiences in videogames, not playing this would be to do yourself a catastrophic disservice. The only real weakness of the game is how barebones the multiplayer is - definitely a step down from ACV in that regard, but there's still a lot of mileage to be had playing duels.",

And the graphics are crisp and detailed, immersing you in a deliciously cold, dark world of steel and misery. The lighthearted moments hit so much harder in such a bleak setting, and the story moves along at a fast clip. You can always linger longer, replay missions, fight in the arena, tweak your build. But when you're ready to move on, the story doesn't linger or dawdle.\r\n\r\nSo much of the game is spent in the garage, customizing your loadout and paint job, trying out different weapons and tweaking stat bars to squeeze every ounce of efficiency out of your mech. Then you go raging through a mission, get a feel for what worked and what didn't, and go back to tweak some more. It's a bit like being a race car driver, spending hours tuning everything to perfection before blasting through a race. Except instead of a race track, you're shooting your way through a mission in a blaze of missiles and giant energy swords with a super-weapon the size of a building.\r\n\r\nI went into AC6 with raw determination, and the crucible of Rubicon refined it into skill. Going back to replay the first mission hours later and annihilating the boss there, using nothing but the starting gear, was a moment of catharsis. I had learned, and I had grown strong.",

I am new to the Armored Core series and this was a breath of fresh air that somehow transported me back to the days of playing the PS2 on a CRT. Very polished with a lot of heart put into it. It takes some getting used to compared to other action games, but the combat loop is extremely tight and rewarding. I am going for S rank on every mission which is the sort of thing I never have time for in most modern games. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.",

        "review": "Every mecha fan's wet dream, honestly. A pretty far departure from previous AC titles, but still distinct enough from other Fromsoft series' to retain its own natural identity and reputation. Customization is next level, and the game's difficulty and playstyle as a whole tends to be dictated almost entirely by how you choose to design your own war machine. Multiplayer is limited; as it always tends to be with Fromsoft games - but I do find it interesting how you have to progress to about the halfway point in your first playthrough to actually unlock the multiplayer in the first place. I'm not sure why that decision was made, but it feels fitting to have to fight your way far enough to earn the privelege to compete against other pilots.\r\n\r\nAbout 30 hours of playtime to get all three endings if you're a returning/veteran pilot. I'd imagine about double that if you're a first time player who's still learning the ropes and taking your time to explore the worldbuilding. This game has buckets upon buckets of lore within it - but it tends to outright stray away from putting it in your face, forcing you to explore and put the puzzle pieces together yourself if you really want to know the true story. That's something I like, no doubt.\r\n\r\nSo far, every update to the game that adds additional content has been entirely free. But I would gladly pay money for a formal DLC like the one that Elden Ring received. Fromsoft never lets you down with their single player titles.",

        "review": "Game's decent, building mechs and trying out different weapons and parts is fun. Combat is fast paced and pretty decent even though the lock-on system feels a bit clunky and unintuitive and I'm not a particularly big fan of the stagger mechanics.\n\nThe boss battles are mostly enjoyable except some of them do feel a bit cheap and like they pidgeonhole you into using certain builds (tracks for CEL 240, quads for Sea Spider for example) which feels a bit odd for a game that states you can design your build around how you like to play.\n\nStory is... well kinda dumb, there are quite a few missions where I thought \"why the hell am I doing this?\" and a lot of other plot elements which really don't make any sense from a logical perspective. Just completed my first playthrough in 24 hours and that was with getting all parts and clearing all the arenas, so the longevity is pretty limited, especially for a game that still costs £50-60 if you don't get it on sale.\n\nThere is a NG+ however I can't say I'm particularly drawn to play it, once you finish your first playthrough you pretty much have everything and more money than you know what to do with, there are two more parts unlockable at the very end of NG+ playthrough but they're not that exciting and I don't feel it's worth another 20 hours just for that. I think it might be partly because the format isn't greatly suited to NG+, most RPG's that have NG+ have XP which gives you an incentive to keep going where AC6 only really has those 2 more parts.\n\nOverall it's decent, wouldn't buy it full price but if you have an itch for a mech game a sale purchase probably won't feel like wasted money.",

FromSoft have absolutely knocked it out of the park by ignoring (rightfully so) their habits in the Souls games, and giving the ARMORED CORE series its due diligence. See, AC is a very different game and franchise from the Souls series, and so I am sure that, like myself, a lot of fans were waiting to see if the AC series would turn into a reskin of Souls gameplay due to FromSoft's obvious success with that franchise. However, that is not the case. They stayed true to the formula of this franchise and expanded and perfected it to levels I dreamt of. I am proud to play this game, and no other words in this review can do the experience of seeing and fighting Balteus for the first time justice.\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor, get a license, and hop into your core, pilot. There are jobs to be done...",

Holy siht I just wanna blow stuff up. Then you also LOSE money for using bullets and taking damage, like dude it is a mech game I dont want to min max and count my bullets mid battle. The game does not even tell you what is needed for S-rank, you can have much better payout, not even use repair kits, shorter time than some youtubers and somehow end up with A-rank. It is a pity because the mech customizations and the 1-on-1 arena are cool can try different builds and what not. I got every achievement except 1 and cant be bothered anymore. I got through 3 endings (a lot of repeat too mind you) in under 30 hours. This is the same price as Elden Ring, which is easily 150-200 hours of content??? Only get it if it is on a deep discount like 50% off.",

        "review": "So, I've tried AC 6\nThe challenge begins when you just try to load into the first mission and got hit by an endless black loading screen. Spent ~20 mins to fix it and now it's fine.\nOverall, it's gameplay oriented game, and it definitely delivers here. It's fun and dynamic. It's not as hardcore as any other Fromsoft title. So far, there was only one boss that really pissed me off(and it's on 28th hour through game). It was the only time when I needed to do a 5 min research to find which weapon[s] would be most efficient in that particular case. Usually, when I struggled with some boss - it's a)build issue (and you can easily adjust it mid-mission) b)tactics and the way I was approaching boss.\nThe customization options for mech are quite broad. From 30 hours in the game I've spent ~1/3 just playing around with different builds, weapons and modules for the mech. \nThe missions length is just fine.  And a plot is not as messed up as in any demon/dark souls game(it has clear, understandable dialogs). As a matter of fact, it's pretty straightforward, although it leaves some space open for interpretation.\n\nRegarding soundtrack. I enjoyed it.I think some, or even most boss fights would have benefited by having unique ost. Still, there are few that had those, end they were truly special and enjoyable. Main menu ost and it's sub-menus(e.g. the one with mech config) also contain really nice soundtrack, which is a big +, since you spend a lot of time in shop and customisation menus.",

Much love to everyone involved in making this Gem and thank you so much for giving me back a piece of my childhood and so much more. My only buyers remorse is not buying it sooner on release like a loyal AC fan :( . Was away from gaming for a long time and this being my first real gaming purchase/play through since I've returned was/is a gift I wont soon forget. Have been ear to ear smiling since i started it. long time fan of the series like me or a new comer? its a 10/10 must buy buddy-Rusty approved. P.S. whoever designed V II Snail , your a dog but i still love you! :^)",

I understand studios will often implement designs they've proven in other projects but to sum up the issue in previous AC titles you went from high speed mech fights all about perfect timing and situational awareness to a mech that needs jump pads to get up, maps that look big but feel choking, and fights that center around filling stun meters. I noticed theres care put into what decals appear based off the angle of impact for projectiles yet all the projectiles look like default graphics most likely so players have better readability of their threats BUT then why the fuck is there no Radar? I'm not sure whether from soft is trying to appeal to more players or the designs teams have forgotten their own games in favor of their most profitable games.",

The game story is a great challenge the AI is good not the best but is perfect for me, I like that they kept some of the old games parts that I liked. I don't particularly like when you recycle assets so much so some of the stages in story are the same I didn't like that so much but the stage was large enough to the point that is felt new from a different angle. \n\nThe Mech control is amazing, with keyboard or controller is well mapped, now you can use all weapons at the same time, it's nuts. The mech and weapons sounds FX are just so good the base the metal to metal grinding is a hell of an awesome experience. \n\nIn the story mode the narrator and mission deployment voices are just so good now, the story now is very good, it was well made.\n\nAfter From Software was merged with Bandai I was not happy with armored core V but congrats on this one!",

But. The Boss Fights in this game (especially the Chapter concluding ones) have such massive, unreasonable difficulty spikes compared to the rest of the game, it's not even funny. I played through 4 Chapters, having a blast with the usual missions, but especially that last, Chapter concluding Boss Fight sucked the fun right out of the game. Looking up solutions online turned up things like: \"Oh btw it's the hardest Boss in the game\"; \"lol just git gud\" and other similarly helpful commentary.",

There's a lot of dashing in this game for both enemy and players alike\n- Smoothest mech game you'll play so far\n- Variety of weapons don't fall short\n- In-game UI is simple yet effective\n- Trying out different builds is fun\n- They really did a perfect job with the voice acting as each character has its own unique personality. Despite the fact that no human faces are shown, they tend to be unforgettable\n\nCONS:\n- Getting the highest rank for each mission is the hardest part as each mission has its own strict requirements\n- Too many explosions is normal in a mech game but this can be a big hassle for some as it can hinder most of your vision\n- There are many weapons that are just not viable. Some are just gimmicky and easy to dodge",

The graphics, music and sound design are also great! The mechanics / controls take some getting used to, especially in terms of the pacing of a fight with another AC or boss, but once you get used to it they are nice to use and intuitive. Once you do get used to the mechanics, you can get some super satisfying final strikes in to defeat bosses, especially with the explosive weapons!",

        "review": "I want to be 100% clear that even though I don't think I'd recommend this game, this is objectively a very good game. Personally, maybe even a perfect game. I know that may sound confusing, just indulge me.\n\nArmored Core VI (AC6) is very well polished, mechanically deep, fast paced, action packed and produced from a game publisher whose pedigree is elite. I don't think I need to speak much on FromSoft's ability to be highly consistent in quality. Begin as C4-621, an augmented AC pilot beneath the authority of Handler Walter. You have no agency, no power, not even your body beyond the drive to become a highly skilled and efficient mercenary. Become the ultimate pilot or perhaps transcend your fate as a mere slave to this world. Either way, destroy any one who stands in your way. Complete the mission. \n\nShit's pretty invigorating right? So, why do I not readily recommend it? \n\nThe caveat is that I'm confident that AC6 has a tendency to be a very niche experience and therefore, difficult to objectively judge, and I believe it shows. (As always, you are your own person, believe what you want, I have no responsibility to provide you with the most accurate data in the world about AC6) After some quick skimming online, it's apparent to me that AC6 is often overshadowed by its less mechanical FromSoft siblings. It's not the hardest game, it's not the highest rated game, it's definitely not the most popular game, some websites didn't even rate it on their miscellaneous lists.\n\nSome issues I can foresee for new players is that they might feel somewhat dissatisfied or confused when starting, especially as some of the first levels can feel extremely easy or far too short. Or when they reach a difficult boss, they feel disgruntled that they have to change their playstyle/mech rather than being able to purely outskill the game. Or it can feel somewhat bland or toneless in its setting despite the inspired art direction. This is all by design. AC6 implores you to try everything, replay everything, collect everything, learn everything, and avoid as much damage as you can and push through it or brute force your machine through the game. Its not impossible, just unlikely to do. And the world is bleak, it is toneless, this is a world where humanity has sunk to the wretches of capitalism and pure cold heartless logic remains in the wastelands of Humanity's creation. You own nothing, not even your very flesh.\n\nIts a difficult game to place that asks a high price for a justly well produced game. But arguably not a readily accessible one compared to its siblings. All I can say is, I implore you to try. I really liked it, I felt that I played enough of it I needed but I'll never say I won't revisit it. \n\nThat being said, I would not be surprised if you didn't like it.",

Visuals are absolutely stunning, the sheer scale of the environment and even bosses is nearly unprecedented and it probably has the best mech combat I've ever played, but unfortunately I feel like the boss nerfs post-release made the game too easy. \n\nI was hoping I'd actually have to learn the different types of weapons, damage types and movesets and adjust my mech accordingly, but in the end I more or less ran the same build with some minor adjustments throughout the whole game [spoiler] (2 cannons on the back, 2 machine guns/mini guns/flamethrowers as primary and focusing everything on QB speed) [/spoiler] and breezed through it without much issue. I only really started dying/learning the fight at the final boss of my first playthrough, since it was just extremely hard to track the movements when your screen is filled with red the entire time, but even that only took around 15 tries till I got through (which isn't a lot considering the fights took <3min each). \n\nPerhaps I accidentally found a meta build, but even when I switched it up it didn't feel much harder. Honestly, the hardest part was getting S-Rank in [spoiler] Attack the Refueling Base [/spoiler] because that mission has extremely tight timings for whatever reason.\n\nStill, as I said the visuals and gameplay are amazing, so as long as you can appreciate that even with a bit less of the typical FromSoft punishment, it's absolutely worth the money.",

The pvp feels... balanced, yet unbalanced? like sure, you can set up to keep the enemy back while you swarm them with missiles, but in the same breath you could be fighting a glass canon that youre incapable of actually touching, while all you do it GET touched. \r\nmy skill issues aside, its a damn good game, 9/10",

        "review": "I just wanted a call sign of my own...\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\n\nGame is fun. Fromsoft games tend to focus on a specific game aspect and excel as far as possible in that. Sekiro? Combat. Elden Ring? Exploration. Dark Souls? Excels at being Dark Souls. This game focuses on build variety and experimentation. You ever play a Fromsoft game and got envy when your 60 hour toon can't equip a really sick ass weapon cos you didn't level a specific stat? You ever play a fromsoft game and pre-plan a build from scratch cos you wanna exploit a specific mechanic? AC6 plays around that idea; building the right mech for the right job is the game loop here. \n\n[h2] Mechanics [/h2]\n\nSome mechanisms aren't explained well (as is typical of From Software) but the shimmy of it is that this is a mech game balanced around light mech (zoom around the level and kill things as fast as possible); medium mech (jack-off-all-trades); and heavy tank mech (slow but big boom boom). There's also a 4th option of tetrapod (flying fortress of death like Ghibli's Castle in the Sky). \n\nThe additional mechanic is the idea of Sekiro-esque posture bar (aka ACS). Normal shots have their damaged on the healthbar reduced by armor. Break through ACS, and the attack is 100% direct on the healthbar. Conventional weapons do the most damage on ACS, but is balanced by a significant normal hit reduction. Energy weapons are do more normal hit damange, but contributes less to ACS buildup. In addition, pulse damage does direct damage onto shields. There's a bring-the-right-gun-to-a-gunfight kind of system here. \n\nThe best way to learn the combat without getting overloaded by information is to check the Official Bandai Namco beginner guide on this game, which I've found to be an excellent resource.\n\n[h2] Game-design [/h2] \n\nThis game's levels are short-burst and designed for you to quickly murder robots and move on to the next checkpoint. The level designs are varied and bring you to some pretty interesting locales. The basic enemy is generally cannon fodder, the more annoying enemies are...annoyances but help keep things interesting. Death brings you to a checkpoint nearby so it rarely if ever feels punishing to die. I like that part, since there's a huge de-emphasis on exploration in the levels, that restarting from scratch would result in a negative experience. This is very much the experience of Ace Combat where you feel a rush from killing enemies, and the game wants you to get in there and kill things for your satisfaction. \n\nThe game breaks up this monotony mainly by scattering very good boss fights with certain gimmicks. These guys are tough, even with the right build - and perform sort of a skill check whilst also keeping that cinematic feel of a boss fight in a Fromsoft game. Cool game. \n\n",

Even trying to change the advanced start location did NOTHING.\n\nI have to believe it's because the anti-cheat is screwing with things because I've never had any other game fail to work this hard. Not even newer games like Baldur's Gate or other newer Fromsoft games like Sekiro. This was an absolute mess and the only option I have is to try to get a refund.\n\nIf this game works for you, then great.

So this is simply toward people like me.\n\nGood\n\n[list]\n    [*]Combat is great. Not super hard outside of few cases even then its more of other issue making it idiotic.\n    [*]Mech customization is great. \n    [*]in general stable game with great lot of general good aspects toward it.\n[/list]\n\nBad or in sense what annoyed me.\n\n[list]\n    [*]Some bosses or combat cases is annoying than challenge. For sample few final bosses or even encounter is simply limited by fact your enemy does some fancy move what confuses you or make´s you blind with shooting effects. Making lot of combat forms annoying. Thanks god you can change loadouts when you die etc. But i still did not find it great. If i´m to play mission with lot of firepower build with rapid weapons to simply skip all these to change to different build. Because you lack ability to counter enemy efficient way. Game penalizes rank with ammo use again.... Some things what annoyed me.\n    [*]Lock on feature do not work. Why have it when annoying bosses who blind your view. Then teleports around, Then do fancy ultra quick spam attack what are hard to dodge as your confused where this bugger went. Its not fun for me at least. Again one biggest nuisance for me in game. This is god awful when multiple boss rank enemy fight where you try track this noxius spam spam spam. To see some random weakling getting locked on when attempting to follow enemy attacks.\n    [*]If i´m not wrong i hoped game would allow more settings in game like set view more back as bigger mech you have and like i spoke about. You get blinded lot and making easy boss harder simply because. You cannot see things and lock on not functioning well. Like ability to move camera more back would be great. \n    [*]I found some weapons lack impact or use. Simply because how game is done it limits in general usage of lot of weapon types. Like i found some late weapons what you unlock like coral category god awful. Not because they are technically bad but how things work out they lack ability maintain combat ability. Like last boss was way easier taking normal heavy machine guns vs super duper tech unlock. OMG coral missiles but they barely hit, slow as hell and most of enemy higher ranking AI won´t do shit. Making me hate these weapons outside of few weapons. But maybe this is major issue as well as this game use same stats in online mode... What make´s balance pvp more important vs player enjoyment usage of player vs everyone. Like again... Maybe useful vs normal player. But.... Just annoyed me lot as last unlocks are shit.\n[/list]\n\n\nEven thought i ranted about more toward issues than good. I found game be 9/10. I did not hate genre and i´m some what fan toward series now. But again i hope they in future add some improvements like make PvP different part of game than PvE. Where both reward of unlocking stuff and enjoyment of gameplay remains good both sides. Also i personally hope they improve game lot in future. Not saying game is bad reminder. Just hoped there was something extra unique toward story than money and few choices to unlock lore.",
