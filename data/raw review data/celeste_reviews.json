I completed Chapter 7, got all the red strawberries up to that part and finished the B-Sides only to find out there were even more chapters and not only B-Sides and red strawberries, but also C-Sides and tons of other colors of strawberries. Honestly, I wouldn't feel surprised if I discovered there were D-Sides as well.\n\nThe game is extremely difficult if you want to complete everything without Assist Mode, but, as you progress through it, you will realize your \"normal gameplay\" is actually the same as what you used to consider \"absurdly hard\" in other levels. As other people have said, it's stressful, but rewarding. And you can always change the difficulty with Assist Mode if you want.\n\nBy the way, the pixel art in this game is amazing.\n\nI 100% recommend it.",

They're pretty long on top of being hard, so you'll definitely play for a while to learn them!\n\nThe game looks beautiful and has tight controls, it feels very satisfying to play and dash through the levels and the music that accompanies you through these levels is just as amazing!\nIt's one of my all time favorite games.\n\nIt has been a while since I played this game myself. I don't know how much got added until now, but I wanted to give it a positive review now, as I constantly recommend this game to others who are asking for recommendations!

        "review": "[h1]A masterpiece for masochistic players[/h1]\nHave you ever heard of or seen any Mario Kaizo? Well, that’s what’s in store for you here. Celeste is a technical pixelated platformer that pleases those who seek a challenge without leaving behind those unfamiliar with it. That makes Celeste satisfying for masochists while still being welcoming for newcomers. I engaged with the game and had a blast. Such a wonderful, challenging experience!\n\n[h1]Celeste is sitting in your backlog, isn’t it?[/h1]\nSo it was in mine. Always putting it off, prioritizing other stuff… Little did I know what I was missing. I strongly recommend that you play it as soon as possible and enjoy a memorable experience. Celeste is really outstanding and more than lives up to the ‘overwhelmingly positive’ reviews on Steam.\n\n[h1]“Not a big fan of difficult games”[/h1]\nIf that’s the case for you, don’t let the labels scare you away from Celeste. Trust me – you will get the hang of this. The game is designed to help players master the mechanics from the very beginning, even when you don’t come to realize it’s happening, due to its subtlety. That’s precisely what keeps you engaged with the game, what makes you feel confident, capable of climbing Celeste mountain.\n\nIn case your struggle persists, the devs offer a customizable assist mode, where you can set the game speed, how many jumps you can perform, stamina, among others. I wouldn’t recommend it because all the fun is overcoming challenges and the game naturally helps us out with that.\n\n[h1]Perfectly increasing difficulty[/h1]\nTo be honest, I’ve never experienced an increasing difficulty in such a literal meaning. When playing games, we usually go through difficult stages but the next isn’t necessarily harder than the previous ones. However, in Celeste, the next stage is indeed going to cost you more attempts and time. The best of all? You won’t rage after dying – you will simply try again because you know what to do and how, needing only to try once more. And that’s what’s magical in this game! You feel challenged, but respected. Everything is pleasantly doable.\n\nThere are crazy challenges for masochists of course. They are optional, but if you ignore them and just beat the game, you won’t be getting the full experience. Hard stages involve a lot of skill and precision to overcome challenges with creative solutions. We're talking about the Dark Souls of platformers in a way. The devs made the helluvah job.\n\n[h1]Any downsides?[/h1]\nNot many, really. I’d say there’s nothing wrong when it comes to actually PLAYING the game. Perhaps, a weak spot could be the story. Madeline is a depressed, anxious ‘girl’, alright, but the story seems to be there just for the sake of it. The storywriter is possibly the one facing those issues and simply mirrored their psychological issues on the character. There’s no background, she simply is anxious and depressed and that’s all.\n\nCeleste is all about proving yourself to be capable of doing anything despite mishaps and doubtful mind. The message is clear: never give up. You can make it. But… that message is passed on in a shallow, maybe childish way, not convincing the audience that’s really applicable to real life. Therefore, possible relatability ends up cracked.\n\nIronically, a game about overcoming anxiety and depression shows a big potential for triggering them in high difficulties.\n\n[h1]Trust the ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback[/h1]\nThere’s not much unsaid. Just take it off of your backlog and give it a chance – you won’t regret. The only regret will be not having dedicated to Celeste before. The game is amazing and unforgettable.\n\nAlthough the high difficulty stages are insane, you will still be able to beat them because you hone your skills and grow with the game all along.\n\nNot before 36 hours recorded on Steam (31 in game) and 7170 deaths did I manage to 100% it. Celeste has been awarded one of the best games I played this year – and plenty have been played!",

        "review": "Very well designed character controller. The 'forgiveness mechanics', finely tuned jump curves and squash and stretch animations makes it a pleasure to just move around as Madeline. One thing to note about the Dash Corner Correction is that it can sometimes snap you over a corner onto some spikes though.\n\nI didn't care much for the puzzle aspects of the game. Sometimes you have to search for the way forward, which to me felt out of place for this title. Also in particular the wind mechanic when it's just slowing you down I just thought made it unfun to move.. It felt like moving through sludge.\n\nThe story touches on perseverance and fighting your inner demons, and I felt it was left general enough that it could mean a lot of different things to different people. Overall I liked the game, and I'm not a big platformer or single-player game kind of person. If you are, or if you're a game developer looking to make a platformer on your own, from a pure character controller standpoint especially, this one's a must play.",

During the climb, you encounter a bunch of strange phenomenons occurring within the mountain that turns into obstacles standing in your way while meeting strange people. The movement is very fun to mess around with, esp. during different times when you have items/bubbles that'll have an effect on your movement in different ways, and will probably make you want to see how far you can go with it(ie obtain more strawberries, beat your time record, and more). This game has really good music as well that make me want to go back to it and listen to the soundtrack again every time. I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to give another platformer a shot!",

Celeste features incredible pixel art, giving a nostalgic feel while also balancing modern day performance. The movement system in this game is forgiving enough to feel fair but the challenges presented are not for the faint of heart. The music composed by Lena Raine is nothing less than breathtaking. The mood of each level is set so well by just the opening few notes of any given track. After playing it is very clear that a lot of time, love, and care was put into this game by the developers. Celeste also offers a beautiful story of a trans woman learning how to deal with and coming to terms with the dark parts of her personality, such as her depression and anxiety telling her to turn back. This is my favorite game of all time, and if you appreciate a fair challenge that with some banging music, I would highly recommend this game.",

On my first attempt, it appeared to be just a super hardcore platforming game, which I'm not particularly good at or enthusiastic about. So, it ended up sitting in my library for quite some time after that first session.\n\nRecently, I came across yet another video praising how great Celeste is. Puzzled at how a seemingly straightforward platforming game could gather such rave reviews, I decided to give it a deeper look this time—surely it wasn't just about the high difficulty, right? That's when I discovered the heartwarming story of Celeste and gained a new perspective on the game. Furthermore, the cutesy art style and uplifting melodies create a comforting atmosphere, softening the intensity of the challenging gameplay.\n\nIt'll probably take me a long time to beat the game, but I'm sure it's going to be a wholesome experience.",

        "review": "I heard about this platformer game here and there – One with really tight controls, a good soundtrack, and an emotional story on-top, but it was only a few months ago after I switched my OS to Linux Mint and was on the hunt for games that ran natively to support that I actually bothered to purchase the game on Steam (Yes, Celeste has a native Linux client, and its good). And then it took me until a few days ago to actually finally play it.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the game's style and aesthetic. Cutesy, charming, calm. Even later when I got to the horrific monsters, they still were pretty tame comparatively speaking. I, personally, found this to be a breathe of fresh air. For context as to why: My favorite band is Nine Inch Nails; I usually play games closer to STALKER: Anomaly and SWAT: Elite Force (recent example); and even my own art is disturbing and grotesque. On a lighter note: The second thing that struck me was that I was a woman (in-game) and that people were referring to me as such. No, I'm not against female protagonists or playing as one, but I did have to deal with an entire game of \"Crigence, darling,\" and \"Ms. Crigence,\" and \"she's like an adorable goth Crigence.\" *shudders*. I guess that's what I get for building the habit of just entering my username into any box that asks for a name.\n\nI also noticed and appreciated the sheer attention to detail and soul in various parts, such as the elderly woman's taunting laughs materializing in the air, and then following you to the next screen; the little 8-bit \"phew\" vocalization for Madeline to match one of her idle animations; Part Of You popping out of the dialog box's frame for emphasis; the little bleeps and bloops changing to represent the tone that the character portraits are meant to represent (which can sometimes be jarring, but I still like it); the whole-ass Celeste Classic minigame, and much more I'm probably forgetting. These touches just add so much heart to the game that could only come from a game made by, like, eight people. The laughing in-particular is almost a highlight of the game for me, as It's rare for games to get an out-loud laugh from me, but that made me genuinely \"lol.\"\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, I should probably add on to the previous background by saying that one of the first games I ever played was Super Mario Bros. Wii, which I got surprisingly good at, even at the tender age of 8, and that love and *skill* in platformers never really went away [obligitory self-advert of my own indev game Bounce Jam goes here]. If I remember correctly, I beat Super Meat Boy (another difficult indie game) in only 700 deaths, which is quite low compared to what other people seem to say. In-fact, I found that game to be quite easy compared to \"the hype,\" due to the simple fact that you spawn back in almost instantly with only ever up to, like, a minute of time loss, which is a description that this game matches quite well also. Due to that generous respawning, this game is rather difficult to actually get angry at, I'd say, or at least *I* never felt frustrated throughout my entire playthrough, even despite me going for every single strawberry I saw (which apparently only amounted to 110 of them). My biggest complaint gameplay-wise would be the dashing. Perhaps I shouldn't complain, since I played the game on an admittedly kinda cruddy *Rockcandy* Xbox 360 controller, but I swear half of the learning curve for this game was just figuring out what angles on the stick would make Madeline go where I actually wanted her to; its to the point where I actually feel pretty justified blaming the game for calibrating the sticks somewhat poorly. An option in the settings menu to recalibrate the stick diagonals would work wonders here. Despite that gripe, I still had a lot of fun, at least after I adjusted myself to the game.\n\nAnyway I've spent 2 hours writing this and my patience is running thin, so I'll wrap this up with one more paragraph about the story, and I saved this for last since its my hottest take: I respect it for what it is, but the story just didn't connect with me that deeply. Admittedly, I do suffer from depression, but I personally can't relate to the idea that there's a \"Part Of Me\" that's just scared and is using hating me as a front, and – an even more comical idea – that just accepting that this \"part\" is \"just scared\" is gonna magically empower me to climb a physical or metaphorical mountain. I know that's a gross over-simplification of what the game is probably saying. but this is how I ingested the story as it was coming, and I just couldn't relate to it. That didn't stop me from loving the characters, though. Madeline is adorable, Part Of You is surprisingly comedic when she isn't antagonizing you, whilst the elderly woman's antagonism is ironically her entire bit, and Theo… I don't know if this is a hot-take, but I found the selfie thing to be kind of cringe. This probably isn't the game's fault, as my opinion on selfies in-general is kinda low – I mean, I can't think of anything more vain than taking a photo of yourself and posting it for the world to see – but regardless, I think it kinda dates the game a little. I can think of far more egregiously Gen Z/Gen Alpha games or trends than this, but it's still an inclusion I personally disagree with, and since selfies are kind of Theo's entire thing it leaves me with the perception that he's a somewhat shallow character obsessed with vanity. Attempting to speak more objectively, though: This is only the half-truth. I somehow don't remember what his motivation for climbing the mountain is, which is probably moreso an insult to me and not the game, but he has his justifications for being in the story and a deeper character than just being the selfie guy, but I won't talk any more on that since frankly l've typed far too much as-is.\n\nThis is the first time I've written a long-ass review with authentic preservation of my initial experience and thoughts and Backloggd in-mind, since for some reason those people like these 5 paragraph long essays, so hopefully somebody's actually reading this to make it feel worth it. If you're reading this, I'd recommend giving the website a look, since you clearly enjoy spending too much time reading other people's thoughts on games and personal anecdotes.",

        "review": "TL;DR: This game is snappy, difficult, fair, charming, and overall just an amazing experience. Go play it.\n\nCeleste is a beautiful and difficult platformer. From the pixelated gameplay to the stylized character portraits to Lena Raine's music, this game is just a treat to experience. Its narrative touches on anxiety, depression, grief, coming to accept every part of yourself, and pushing through no matter the circumstances. It's a very endearing story that appeals to many groups of people (especially queer folk), and greatly supports its challenging gameplay.\n\nThis is the hardest platformer I've ever played. Period. \nBut, at no point during any of the levels did I feel that the game was 'unfair.' The controls are precise, and the game NEVER incorporates any mechanics that are random. Every screen demands pure practice and skill, and that's where a lot of the beauty of the game comes from. It's a very rewarding feeling to beat a section that you initially thought was impossible, when the only thing that changed was you getting better. You'll view the thousands of deaths you'll accumulate not as a point of failure but as a visual representation of how far you've come.\n\nAs much as this game caters to hardcore platforming fans, it's also very accessible to casual or even brand new players. The assist options lets you tweak many aspects of the game in a range, allowing you to fine-tune how difficult your experience is. This can be from slowing the game down, to extra air dashes, to straight invincibility. \nI encourage anyone who might be on the fence because of the game's difficulty to give it a shot as you can curate the perfect difficulty for you if you need to. This game also plays well on both controller and keyboard, so the choice comes down to personal preference.\n\nIn terms of game length, Celeste offers a huge selection of secret and post-game content for those who seek the extra challenge. While the game's main story consists of Chapters 1-7, Ch 8 & 9 serve as epilogues, and the game's respective B-Sides and C-Sides serve as extra difficult remixes of levels to play through.\nI was able to finish the main story in about 8 hours, but as someone who got through the post-game at a faster pace, I completed all the extra chapters and remixes in about 24 hours. For the average player, this would take around 40 hours to reach 100% completion.\nAt no point after Chapter 7 is the player obligated to keep going, the point where the game truly ends is up to the player.\nWant to call it after completing Ch 7? No problem. \nWant to complete Ch 8 & 9 but don't want to do C-Sides? Go for it. \nWant to go for 115% completion? Godspeed you crazy bastard.\n\nTo try and stop my rambling, this is one of my favorite platformers ever. Its gameplay is so refined, its story moving, and is just a rewarding experience every step through. I couldn't recommend it more, especially to platforming fans, it's a must-play.\n\nSo go buy the game, you egg. <3",

It proves that you can have minimal moveset upgrades throughout the game (literally one permanent one) and still have a phenomenally well-crafted, tight platforming game that feels fresh even in this old genre. Besides that though, the story and characters are incredibly personal, poignant, witty, and cosy, while presenting a well-formulated and coherent message that wraps up perfectly at the end. This game taught me to cry happy tears. Play it.",

        "review": "Overall, I definitely recommend this platformer, The music and the art style are wonderful, and the gameplay is deceptively simple in the beginning with a great deal of complexity revealed later on. It's addictive with just the right amount of difficulty increases as the game progresses. Accomplishing challenges, and finding collectables, which themselves often require precision to obtain, is hugely gratifying. \r\n\r\nThe plot is reasonably well done, and it blends well with the gameplay. It has its charming, as well as its inspiring moments, and there are some quite pithy lines from secondary characters. Nevertheless  I, a 32 y/o gamer, found it to be a tad adolescent for my tastes; I would imagine that it would have the most impact for gamers in the 'young adult' audience. However, if the total sales of Inside Out 2 are to suggest anything, it's that stories about anxiety are very much still in vogue. On re-playing levels, I must admit though to always to skipping the cutscenes. \r\n\r\nThere is an awful lot to do once the main story is over, and herein lie a few of my gripes (with some spoilers, so this is where to stop reading if you want to experience the game blind.) The final and next-to final chapters are locked behind collectable walls, and while the penultimate chapter has this at the beginning, the final chapter has this at (or perhaps near) the end, after quite challenging platforming. It's a 'gotcha' moment on the part of the developers, and I must admit to feeling cheated. The game has stopped being fun for me now that I am required to collect everything in order to see the final ending, so I'm probably going to leave it unfinished. I've noticed a severe rise in my annoyance at some of the optional levels. In this vein, there is a steep drop-off in the Steam achievements, with only 7.4% of all gamers completing the final chapter, so I take it I am not alone in this sentiment.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I have enjoyed the time spent with Celeste, and would certainly recommend it. I would expect the younger end of the gaming audience to derive the most enjoyment from the plot on average. \r\n\r\n",

        "review": "I bought Celeste thinking it would be a relaxing platformer to unwind with after work. Little did I know I was signing up for a masterclass in humility and thumb dexterity.\n\nFrom the get-go, the game lures you in with its charming pixel art and soothing soundtrack. \"This is pleasant,\" I thought, as I guided Madeline through the opening scenes. Then came the spikes, the pits, the moving platforms, and the realization that gravity is not my friend.\n\nEach level presents a new way to test the limits of your patience and the structural integrity of your controller. Missed that ledge by a millimeter? Back to the start you go! Tried to grab a strawberry that's clearly out of your league? Prepare to plummet into oblivion. I haven't felt this challenged since I tried assembling furniture with instructions in another language.\n\nBut here's the thing: for every hundred times I failed (and yes, the game keeps count just to rub it in), the moment I finally succeeded felt like I'd conquered Everest. Except instead of frostbite, I had a sense of pride and a thumb cramp.\n\nThe story is unexpectedly profound. As Madeline climbs the mountain, she's also navigating the treacherous terrain of her own psyche. It's like an emotional obstacle course where the real boss battle is against your inner demons—who, by the way, are just as relentless as the game's obstacles.\n\nThe characters are endearing. Theo is the kind of friend who'd convince you to go on a hike and then document your misery for social media. The hotel concierge? Let's just say I've had vacations go south, but nothing quite like that.\n\nBy the end of it, I wasn't sure if I had beaten the game or if the game had beaten me. But one thing's for sure: I've never felt so accomplished and so personally attacked at the same time.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for a game that will challenge you, move you, and possibly make you question your life choices, Celeste is the mountain you need to climb. Just make sure to stock up on snacks and maybe schedule an appointment with your chiropractor.\n\n10/10 would ascend into madness again.",

As you guide Madeline up the mountain, the story hits on really real themes like anxiety and self-doubt, and you can’t help but connect with her struggles. The way the game ties her personal journey into the gameplay makes it feel special. Plus, the music is beautiful and the levels are always fun to explore. It’s a game that’s not just fun, but also makes you think and feel.",

I don't even like platformers, but I've beaten the main game, all B-Sides, and as I'm writing this I'm in the final room of the Final Chapter's C-Side. Lena Raine's music is sublime. The gameplay is beyond fun. The story is amazing. If you've ever had any problems with mental health (and let's be honest, everyone's had some struggle at some point. It's what makes us human), even if you aren't trans yourself, you will relate to this game strongly. It's a beautiful story about mental health told through the eyes of a trans woman (Though, if you are trans, certain elements and imagery may be more impactful to you). Play the game, this is an order.",

No other game uses these keys, hence no muscle memory. Horrible decision. \r\nFurther, I played it on a Macbook, where up and down keys are tiny and you would constantly press down by accident sending the character to the abyss. \r\n\r\nI cannot fathom why it got so many positive reviews. My only guess it gets tons of likes from kids and young people who have never had to “enjoy” the 8-bit game era. Back then, the cartridges had very little memory. You could not fit a large game on a cartridge, and you could not even save the game. A game like Sonic had about 4-5 short levels, but they were made unbelievably hard to make the game last longer. You could spend the entire day to reach level 5, and then mom tells you it’s time to go to bed. You will have to play all that horror again tomorrow, from the very start. It was NOT a good time. \r\nWhen PlayStation 1 came with their memory cards, it was such a relief! \r\n\r\nThere is no reason whatsoever why a modern game should be made this way. We are no longer in 1995. Modern platformers can be good, story-rich, and not require replaying the same level 87 times. Take Ori. It was great. \r\n\r\nThis is a not a good game. Unless you are a masochist, or you are looking to punish yourself for something, then it is.",

Perfect difficulty curve, simple but deep movement options, extremely heartfelt and relevant story arc, excellent accessibility options, clean and beautiful visuals, and a wide variety of challenges and environments.\r\n\r\nThe only criticism I could level at the game is that getting through the whole story is challenging. Depending on how quickly you progress through the levels, the pacing of the story can be extremely slow. On the other hand, the difficulty of the game is integral to the story and a large part of what makes the story rewarding. The difficulty curve is also so good that every new level you encounter will be just barely beyond your capability, until you practice it a lot. Even players who have great difficulty with the game can still almost always get to the summit if they use accessibility options. The game is so good at upgrading your platforming skills that even players who start with heavy accessibility options enabled often remove those handrails over time, and eventually reach the summit without them, or with just slight tweaks enabled.\r\n\r\n10/10",

The story, the music, the visuals, and of course the gameplay in particular is all superb. I'm not a big platformer fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this one, and intend to play through the later chapters (after the technical \"end\" of the game, which I've completed) before long. Currently, Celeste sits as my second or third favorite game of all time, after The Outer Wilds and the Portal series. Phenomenal company to be in, to say the least. Overall, 100% would recommend.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Trans people can double jump, 10/10.",

The game actually pictures all of the stages of achieving a goal, the ups and downs. It actually made me emotional, it was so hard to progress through Oshiro's hotel that I decided to leave it for a bit. But in the end, the feeling of reaching the summit is unforgettable. Totally recomend.",

The simple dash mechanic alone reinvigorates familiar gameplay, and the levels themselves are rich with features like gusting winds or blocks that react to your abilities. The entire story of a girl scaling a mountain is a fairly transparent yet pretty powerful metaphor.",

The difficulty ramps up quickly, requiring precise movements and perfect timing, making every level feel like a real accomplishment once you master it. It’s tough but fair, and it gives you that \"just one more try\" feeling that keeps you hooked. What really stands out for me is the music. The soundtrack is not only beautiful but also adds so much emotion and intensity to the experience. The way it blends with the gameplay is amazing, making even the toughest sections feel really epic. \n\n★★★★★",

Challenging, strict, yet fair and insanely rewarding.\r\nOne of the best stories of any platformer. When the community is still picking up on new hidden meanings years after the game's release, you know it's well designed.\r\nIn my opinion, gorgeous pixel art graphics. Perhaps not for everyone but they certainly have a charm to them and the game uses them to their absolute fullest potential. The characters are expressive and lifelike despite having no faces in their sprites.\r\nAbsolutely god-tier soundtrack, vibrant, catchy and absolutely chock full of amazing details. Lena Raine knocked it out of the park.\r\nA surprisingly active modding scene, with tons of amazing custom levels being published all the time.\r\nOne of the best platformers ever made.\r\n",

The story is really simple, yet powerful and emotional, and all of the characters are very likeable and they grow on you to the point that you will miss them when it's time for you to move on to the next game.\n\nThe game is HARD!! though fair. It consists of the main story, but each level has two harder (but optional) variants that make for a good challenge and bring more hours of game, that is, if you are willing to suffer (in a good way) and sacrifice a little bit of your sanity just so you can feel proud and call yourself a pro gamer.\n\nThe gameplay is addictive. The visuals are very lovely, and the soundtrack is spectacular!!! I am currently working in getting all of the achievements, and it's hard but I am having a lot of fun!",

Ama oyunun fragmanında kış temasını görünce içim ısınıverdi oyuna. Yani grafiklerini beğenmememe rağmen oyunu almamın nedeni grafiklerinden çok beni içine çeken atmosferiydi. \r\n\r\nOyunun bu denli zor olduğunu bilmiyordum oyunu aldığımda. Daha ilk bölüme alışmaya çalışırken 100. ölüşümde falan fark ettim neyle karşı karşıya olduğumu :D Oyunda sadece, ileri-geri, zıplama, tutunma gibi mekaniklerle ilerleyebiliyoruz. Oyunda \"assist\" modu var. Bunu etkinleştirdiğimizde oyun çok daha kolay hale gelebiliyor -itiraf etmem gerekirse ben 3-4 kısımda etkinleştirdim-. Fakat bunu olabildiğince açmamanızı öneririm. Çünkü oyunun amacı, hatta hikayesinin de amacı, zorluklarla mücadele etme.\r\n\r\nOyunun hikayesi etkileyici ve sevimliydi. Açıkçası oyuna başlamadan bir gün önce ruhsal olarak çöktüğüm zamanlardandı ve oyunda geçen kimi diyalogları tam olarak kendime sormuş ya da aklımdan geçirmiştim. Bu yüzden oyunun hikayesi beni oldukça etkiledi. Oyunun hikayesi Madeline adındaki bir genç kızın Celeste Dağı'na içindeki karanlıkla başa çıkmak için tırmanması. Oyun ruh sağlığı, öz güven sorunları, içimizdeki karanlıkla mücadele etme gibi temalara değiniyor.\r\n\r\nBenim için oyundaki diğer özelliklerde oldukça güzeldi. Müzikler, seslendirme sanatçılığı vs. Tek sorun bazı bölümlerin gereksiz uzatılmış olduğu. Yani bölümler içindeki zorluk tamam ama bazı yerler o kadar aşırı uzatılmış ki artık eğlendirmekten çok bıktırdı. Belki oralara da hikaye eklenseydi bu kadar sıkıcı gelmeyebilirdi. Bunu hissettiğim iki-üç yer oldu. Ama genede oyun kesinlikle oynamaya değer.",

I will miss having experienced it from beginning to end as I just did. In terms of pure gameplay it is my favorite platformer to date, and disputably top 3 all time games. I adore the characters, the graphic design, and certainly music track. An unparalleled game within its genre and beyond. I laud the creators, and express my gratitude for having enriched my life through the video game medium, if it can even be confined to a characterization. I recommend to all, and with that, I will now sleep, as I remained awake throughout the night, oblivious to time, ceaselessly jubilant as I traversed the Celeste mountain. <3",

That’s where the true evil of the developers reveals itself. Sure, it looks all cute and innocent but don’t let those visuals fool you. This game isn’t here to be your friend. It’s here to break your spirit, piece by piece, as you climb this mountain of madness.\n\nIt’s difficult. Like, \"make-you-question-all-your-life-choices\" difficult. I went in thinking, “Yeah, I got this!” Next thing I know, I’m staring at a death counter that climbed faster than I did. After 949 deaths (yes, 949), I finally reached the summit. And let me tell you, each death felt personal. The mountain wasn’t just a metaphor for overcoming obstacles; it was a cruel, pixelated reminder that the devs delight in your suffering.\n\nBut you know what? After all that, I wouldn’t change a thing. Celeste is beautiful, challenging, and somehow rewarding in ways I never expected. Plus, it taught me perseverance... or maybe just stubbornness.

My number of deaths has reached the 4000s, and I do not feel that any of it went to waste. It really is a game about trying and trying even when you're frustrated and close to giving up, and seeing how all those seemingly futile efforts lead to amazing results. Highly recommend (despite the killer difficulty curve).",

The game looks good, controls smooth, great story, etc. \nIn Celeste, you play as a girl named Madeline who is climbing up a mountain, reasoning being \"to accomplish something.\" She has anxiety and such. Makes sense when you play the game.\nAnyway, the game is a challenge. You will die, lots. However, each death doesn't feel like a fault of the game's. The controls are so precise that every death is your own fault. You learn what you did wrong and try again. And, unless you really, really don't enjoy, keep playing this game until Chapter 7, the final chapter. Once you beat that, put the game down. I don't care. But there's so, so, so much more to this game! Plus, it's easy to mod so if you are like me and have gotten really close to 100%, there are so many phenomenal mods. Pick up the Strawberry Jam Collab when you get the chance.\nOverall, one of the, if not the best platformer I've ever played. 10/10.",

Your skills by the end of the game will be much, much better than at the start: the levels I died dozens of times in on my first playthrough I can beat with just a few deaths or even deathless on a rerun. \nMy favorite thing about level design here is that you never have to wonder what the level wants you to do, it is either obvious from its layout, or after a few attempts.\nBesides, the game has additional content if you want to go further, in form of collectibles and additional level packs, that make you to look at mechanics you thought you knew under new angle.",

The base game is delightful and with many interesting platforming ideas. The difficulty was, I thought at that moment, challenging. \r\n\r\nThen, every level as a side B, which is a very challenging twist of those level ideas where you think that you are even cheesing the game a little with some techniques. No place for error here. Nice, a good challenge I really... Wait.\r\n\r\nSide C? Those weren't cheese, they are actually techniques you need to master? Oh boy. No place for error, no place for improvisation; it's just you, the yellow heart and your plan.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, in any other game, I would have given up. However, Celeste is hard, but it always is fair. The controls are amazingly precise, and after every death you will say ''Damn, I did not do the right move!'' and never ''Damn, I did press that button, this is broken''.\r\n\r\nAnd if you ever triumph over the game many challenges, the community is there for you to challenge you in levels that would have though impossible (Spring Collab or Strawberry Jam are amazing love letter for this game). I could not recommend enough, play this gem.",

This game is so fun and fluid that I don't mind tackling screens over and over, no matter the difficulty. If I had to provide an example of excellent, even perfect game-design, then this would be it. Top 5 games of all time for me. Be warned, the game is hard. I managed to get all achievements without assist mode, but it's there if you need it. You've got this.",

The game gives every mechanic it's time to shine in a challenging and rewarding platforming experience. I'm not going to act like Celeste is the hardest or most brutal platformer to 100% but the difficult content in the optional content feels extremely rewarding to work through and thanks to it's extremely well designed mechanics you can rest easy knowing every screw up is your own fault. My only issue with the game could very well just be my own fault but I played the entire game using an XBOX ONE controller and while I love the feel of platformers on controller I just noticed that it was quite easy to mess up diagonal dash inputs every now and then resulting in many MANY deaths throughout my entire playthrough. I would say the easy solution would be to switch to keyboard for more precision but later in the game when you are exposed to the [spoiler]golden feather[/spoiler] power up I already had to switch to the control stick to reasonably control it so I don't really know if anyone else had this issue. Overall I would say this game is a shining example of how to make a tightly designed game and should be used as an example wherever game design is taught.",

There's also incredible mod support to dig into if you're looking for more content after the base game. \n\nCeleste has easily become one of my favourite games and I can recommend it to anyone who's interested. 10/10",

Game is really fucking hard if you go beyond the summit, but if you're good with picking up game mechanics, a little bit of practice and time should do it. Hopefully. It does have flaws at times, mostly due to weird level design or inconsistent difficulty spikes. (🌙🍓)\n\nHighly recommend it; cute story, challenging and fun, blah blah blah trans rights",

The visual department is beautiful, the dialogue manages to convey emotions despite that the characters just talk gibberish. The story is a tale as old as time but it is greatly told, with good thematic strength. The game also has a great sense of skill progress, I caught myself many times saying out loud \"Damn I just did that tough part effortlessly\". It's evident that the developers put a lot of work and effort into the design of the levels and the game in general. This is a great platformer, everyone should give it a chance 9/10",

        "review": "This game has the best movement out of any game I've ever had the pleasure to try out. Combine that with excellent presentation (especially the amazing soundtrack), fantastic level design that ramps up difficulty and complexity in a really satisfying way, a grat story that doesn't get in the way of the action but really compliments it for those interested, and excellent quality of life and acessibility settings (even if you can do the levels normally, I really reccomend trying out assist mode at least once, its a really fun change of pace). I also gotta compliment the way that things like the strawberries are completely optional with no content gated behind them, many lesser games would have made them obligatory and really dragged down the pace insteado fo making them the fun bonus challenges they are. The game never feels like its reprimanding you for not taking every optional challenge, which is important becasue some of them are VERY hard (who hurt the creators to for them to make farewell?).\r\n\r\nAltough I love the game deeply, I will mention that there are aspects that annoy me or in some cases even dislike. One of the great assets of the game is its low punishment for death, with plenty of checkpoints making even harsh challanges tollerable, but later on in the game there are a considerable amount o screens that feel like they could work better as separate challenges, as the only way they escalate difficulty is having to do more tricks in a row, which just isn't the type of challange I find fun in this game. Also, while most of the level mechanics mostly just elevate or otherwise build onto the core movement in satistying ways, there are a couple that mostly change how you control ( cheif among them the feather, which annoyingly is one that shows up a lot), and are ok in the less difficult stages they are introduced in, but become really frustrating when precision  is demanded of them in levels like the B and C sides. I also don't like how the latter half of farewell and the core B-side (which also is required to even play the c-sides) are gated behind the easter eggs of the regular crystal hearts, but this is admittedly a nitpick\r\n\r\nOverall, all of my problems with the game are because I love it deeply and they are flaws that stick out amongst my enjoyment, and I you anjoy platformers at all, or are a fan of challenging games that reward you for putting in the effort, I highly reccomend this\r\n\r\nTrans Rights!",

        "review": "Celeste: The Review: Part 1: I hate this game.\n\nThe Collectibles.\n\nWhat kind of FUCKING game has collectibles that don't enhance gameplay? Each time I pick up a strawberry I should be receiving an extra jump, a speed boost, or at least a small voice line. Imagine how cool it would be if madeline said \"YIPPEE\" after collecting something. How can a game that released in TWENTY EIGHTWEEEEN not have SUCH A SIMPLE THING!???? IT'S NONSENSICLE,  EVEN A SMALL \"oh boy a fucking strawberry. I love strawberries. I am gong to use these to make pie later\"-BUT NOPE. THEY COULDN'T EVEN MANAGE THAT,\n\nThe collectibles part 2: GOLDEN STRAWBERRIES\n\nWHY ARE THERE GOLDEN STRAWBERRIES. I WENT RTHROUGH PAINSTAKING HOURS TO ACHIEVE THE GOLDEN STRABWERRIES AND AT THE END I FOUND OUT I DON'T EVEN GET ANYTHING FOR IT. THERE'S NOT EVEN AN ACHIEVEM,TN ON STEAM FOR DOING SO. NOT EVEN ON XBOX, NOT EVEN ON PS5!! WHAT THE ACTUAL SHIT?! DO YOU KLNO0W HOW LONG THAT TOOK ME? DO YOU REALIZE I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTAKC TRYING TO GET THOSE DAMN RED BERRIES. THERY'RE NOT EVEN BERRIES. FUCK YOU GOD. WHY ARE BANANAS BERRIES?! \n\nPart 3: Theo.\n\nTheodore J Townley is the deutoragonist in this story. Guess what he can do?! GUESS WHAT HE CAN DO?! GO IN THE FUCM,KING VENTS!!! I WANT TO GO IN THE VENTS. BUT I CAN'T. 2018B GAME BY THE WAY...  THEO IS SO ANNOYING TOO. HE SAYS \"YOLO\" 2018 GAME BY THE WAY. actually that makes sense.  \n\nPart 4: THE PIXEL ART.\n\nThere comes a certain point in each texture's life in this game, where they will come to meet a corner. At that corner, the pixels do not connect, and are very jarringly cut off and restarted. This makes it very ugly. speaking of the pixel art: THEY COPIED MARIO. THERE IS AN ENEMY IN THI SGAME THAT IS TH\"WOMP BUT ISNTEAD OF MOVING UP AND DOWN, HE GOES LEFT AND RIGHT. HE EVEN GOES \"uwuwuwuwowod[sfggf\" just like THWOMP. #YOURENOTTHWOMP\n\nPart 5: THE BIRD.\n\nSCREW THE BLUE BIRD. MADELINE. STOP CHASING TYHE BLUE BIRD. WHY CANT YOU REALIZE THE BLUE BIRD IS NOT YOUR GRANDMA. HOW DOES SHE NOT REALIZE THIS? Sometimes, I think madeline is an actually good character-AND THEN I AM REMINDED OF THIS BULLSHIT. YOU ARE DREAMING. HOW IS THIS REAL?!! WHY CAN THE BIRD SPEAK BY THE WAY?! WHY DOES THE BIRD SAY \"X + ↗\". THAT'S NOT EVEN ENGLISH. HOW DOES A BIRD SAY THAT?! 2018 GAME BY THE WAY.\n\nPart 6: The controls\n\nEveryone always says \"Ohhh, this game's controls are so tight\" or \"Ohh, If you mess up, you know it's your fault,\" BUT FUCKING SCREW THAT SHIT. I AM AN ASCENDED GOD GAMER. DO YOU KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM?! I AM SIX EUROS. ALSO KNOWN AS KAZUTRASH. I DO NOT MESS UP. I DO NOT MISINPUT-IT  IS THE GAME'S FAULT. I DASHED STRAIGHT, NOT DIAGONALLY. THI SHAPPENED 4 TIEMS IN A ROW GOING FOR THE GOLDEN STRAWBERRY ON LEVEL 7. I HATE THE CONTROLS. I AM SIX YEARS OLD. I DO NOT MISS.\n\nPart 7: STORY? MORE LIKE BORED-YEE\n\nStory? HAH. What story?! The fans of this game claim there's A DEEP narrative to be taugth anf told here,. yet ALL THIS IS IS A MOUNTIAN CLIMBINNG SIMULATOR. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE DOES THAT AND IS WAY MORE FUN?! GETTING OVER IT WITH BENNET FODDY. AND THAT GAME ACTUALLY TAKES SKILL. YOUR ACHIEVEM,TSN MAY AS WELL MEAN NOTHING, SINCE YOU CAN GO INTO ASSIST MODE AND BECOME INVINCIBLE. AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE NONETHEWISER. SPEAKING OF:\n\nPart 8: Assist Mode. \n\nWhy does this exist? Why can you still get trophies with it on?! I DONT DCARE IF YOU HAVE A DISABILITY. IF YOU CANT PLAY THE GAME, YOU SHOULDNT BE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. GO BACK TO MINECRAFT, YHOU ABSOLUTE LOSER. IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY A A 2D PLATFORMER. I AM SIX YEARS OLD AND IM ALREADY A GODAMN GENIUS.\n\nPart 9: Madeline's LACCK OF MOTIVATION\n\nWHY THE HELL DOES SHE WANT TO CLIMB THIS THING ANYWAY? HER MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN, BUT WHY?! SHE JUST WANHTS TO GET AWAY? OH SCREW THAT. IMAGINE WANTING TO ESCAPE FROM YOU REVERYDAY LIFE AND RUNNING OFF TO CLIMB MOUNT FUCKING EVEREST. WITH NO PROPER PREPARATION BY THE WAY. \n\nPart 10: HOW DOES SHE CLIMB THIS THING? \n\nShe's NEVER climmbedd a mountain before in her life but all of a sudden, just with a little determinmation she can overcome this? ALONG WITH ALL THE MAGIC BULLSHIT GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME? IF THIS WERE ANY ORDINARY HUMAN THEY WOULD DIE. THEY WOULD LACK THE PREPARATYION. THEY WOULD LAKC THE FORESIGHT. THEY WOULD LACK THE SKILL. BUT THIS BITCH HAS PLOT ARMOR. SHE FELL OFF BY THE WAY. DID YOU KNOW THAT? SHE FALLS OFF THE MOUNTIAN AND DOESNT DIE? SHE CRASHES THROUGH CRYSTALS ON THER WAY DOWN AND ISN'T BLOODIED AT ALL. WHERE IS THE BLOOD? WHERE IS THE CARNAGE? WHERE IS THE SLAUGHTER?!\n\nPart 11: Fun vs Difficult\n\nYou know what's fun? SUPER AMRIO BROTHERS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S FAIR? SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. NOW THAT'S a mans GAME. Two brothers on their way to save the princess, stomping some....KOOPAS...along the way, throwing shells at cactus' , makinn em fall.... ahh classic...AND THEN THERE'S THIS. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN THERE'S PIXEL PERFECT JUMPS YOU HAVE TO DO?! I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THAT. I AM MAD. I AM ENRAGED. WHILE I AM MAD AND ENRAGES, I AM GOING TO MISS THESE JUMPS. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ONTRTYING TO DO THESE DURING THE GODLEN STRAWBERRY RUNS.\n\npART 12: MAGIC MOUNTAIN?!\n\nYou know WHAT? why does THIS \"other self\" BITCH EXIST? she's always so pessimistic. SHE EVEN TRIES TO KILL US AT ONE POINT, AND WE DON'T BANISH HER RIGHT THEN AND THERE? YOU'VE GOTTA BE SHITTING ME. WHAT DO YOUMEAN? WHY DOES THIS RANDOM MOUNTAIN IN CANADA- IN CANADA OF ALL PLACES-posses a MAGICAL TWINKLE SPARKLY MAGICAL STUPID MOUNTAIN. \n\nPart 13: The Tutorial\n\nRemember the bird I mentioned earlier? THAT THING IS THE TUTORIAL. YES. I KNOW. THAT IS THE STUPIDEST FUCKING THING I HAVE EVER HEARD OF. I GOT STUCK ON THE BRIDGE TUTORIAL FOR TWENTY MINUTES. THE BIRD SAID WHAT TO DO. DO I LOOK LIKE I SPEAK BIRD? NO. I REMIND YOU. I AM SIX YEARS OLD. I DONT SPEAK ENGLISH FOR GODS SAKE. SO...I was left scrambling with my controller, struggling tofigure out what may as well be HIEROGLYPHS ON MY SCREEN IN FRONT OF ME. Eventually I just got lucky, and was able to complete the tutorial.\n\nPart 14: This game is COCKY.\n\nThis game is far too full of itself. THEY REALLY THINK THEY'RE MAKING SOME RIGHTEOUS POINT ABOUT SELF DISCOVERY?! AND THEY USE THE OTHER SELF TO DO SO? THIS IS JUST SILLY. I WISH I HAD AN OTHER SELF TO CONFER WITH; HOW ABOUT WRITING A PROPER WAY TO DEAL WITH YOUR EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS, RATHER THAN SIMPLY HAVING ANOTHER YOU TO DISCUSS THIGNS WITH? HOW UTTERLY FOOLISH.\n\nPart 15: Performance Issues\n\nYes-I SHIT YOU NOT. THI SGAME IS LAGGY-LIKE 10FPS LEVELS LAGGY. HOW ARE WE IN 2024 AND DON'T HAVE APPLE II SUPPORT.  MY GRANDPA GAVE ME THIS COMPUTER AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT INCLUDING A COPY OF THIS DOGSHIT GAME WHEN I WAS 4. IT TOOK ME THIS LONG TO COMPLETE IT AND WRITE A REVIEW BECAUSE IT KEPT CRASHING, ON TOP OF THE ALREADY LAGGY MENU. WHY IS THERE A 3D MENU? YOU NEED AT LEAST AN IBM5100 TO RUN THIS GAME. SCREW YOU.\n\nPart 16: B SIDES\n\nTHE BASE GAME HAS HARDER LEVELS TO DO ON TOP OF THE ALREADY HELLISH A SIDES. THEY CALL THEM B SIDES. OH YEAH DID I MENTIOPN THER'ES ALSO EVEN MORE DIFFICULT C SIDES? WHO KNOWS IF THERE'S SOME HIDDEN D SIDES. OH YEHA, AND ONCE YOU COLLECT ALL THE CRYSTAL HEARTS, THERE'S TWO EVEN MORE SECRET LEVELS TO COMPLETE THAT YOU CAN ONLY COMPLETE IF YOU ARE SOME SORT OF GODLY SPEEDRUNNER. CHAPTER 9 BROKE ME. I DONT THINK I AM EVEN A REAL LIFE BEING ANYMORE. BY THE WAY:\n\nPart 17: THE CRYSTAL HEARTS.\n\nOh yeah, do you like puzzles? BECAUSE I SURE THE FUCK DON'T.  WHY DOES THI SPLATFORMER HAVE PUZZLES? AND why ARE THEY ESSENTIAL FOR STORY CONTENT? (chapters 8 and 9). THERE'S A LEGIT PUUZZLE IN THIS GAME THAT IS A PAPER MARIO REFERENCE. IF YOU NEVER PLAYED PAPER MARIO, THIS JUST MAY AS WELL BE IMPOSSIBLE. OH YEAH, AND FOR ANOTHER ONE, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT DIRECTION SOME RANDOM BIRDS FLEW ALL THE WAY BAKC IN CHAPTER ONE. WHAT>!\n\nG fucking G this game sucks. NOT EVEN A COLOR BLIND MODE. I HAD A SEIZURE PLAYING THIS. :D\n\n4/20\n\n\n\n\n",

The learning curve is perfect and the game makes the right choice to keep the basic mechanics simple. Each level has a new type of obstacle that interacts with your basic jumps, dashes, and climbs that  forces you to use adapt and learn. \r\n\r\nVisually and audio, perfect. The sprite work once again seems simple at first but as you get to later levels, the artistry gets severely impressive. \r\n\r\nNow a bone to pick. On it's own its a 9/10 game. But I ran into extreme, capital E, technical issues. The game would crash every thirty minutes or so with at least seven different crash reasons. Redownloading and verifying did squat. It got to the point where I couldn't finish the endgame content because the game would crash before reaching a check point. \r\n\r\nHonestly any other game, this would have been a dealbreaker.",

Im curious what is there but there is no sufficient background or motive told for madeline if at all for me to want to reach the top. I will play this game here or there once in a while in hopes of finishing the game one day but honestly im dissappointed for how less storyline there is and im already starting chapter 5. If you enjoy solving little maze puzzles and using some timing and game mechanics like jumps and dashes to clear levels then this game might be for you but it almost feels pointless as to why im solving them without a storyline to work with.",

At the heart of it are incredibly well-designed and deceptively simple movement controls that just feel damn good to use and lend themselves to an incredibly high skill ceiling, with advanced techniques to be learned and mastered. It has brilliant gameplay elements and mechanics that change and evolve from level to level, getting progressively more difficult from \"slight learning curve but I've got it\" to \"I will throw my controller at the wall because I've died 13,000 times (yes the game counts your deaths, and they will be numerous).\"\r\n\r\nDon't get the wrong idea though; the game does get ridiculously hard and only extremely dedicated players will 100% it, but it's more than possible for a casual player to play through the main story -and what a story it is! Touching and legitimately inspiring, it's far more than I though I would be getting from a game of this nature.\r\n\r\nWhat will motivate you to keep pushing forward is that every room's challenge comes from a place that is both cerebral and physical. You must both solve the puzzle of how you need to maneuver, and develop the skill to execute it (not unlike rock climbing IRL). It's a perfect gameplay loop of frustration, perseverance, and reward that will have you learning from your mistakes and quickly doing things you'd have never thought possible at the outset.\r\n\r\nAnd on top of all this: the soundtrack is absolute perfection. 10/10",

It's theme is ever present in the gameplay, and it has an excellent story about perseverance and overcoming obstacles. It is a difficult game, but never infuriating. The game itself gives you reminders that you can do it, and it encourages you every step of the way. While the base game is a good standalone, there are also the b and c sides to complete and the farewell chapter, if you're up for the challenge. The soundtrack is also killer. Lena Raine did an excellent job. The art style is excellent throughout. If I could buy this game multiple times, I would (Oh wait, I can, and I did :P). It's normally priced at $20, which is well worth the money, but if you can't afford it, I've seen it go on sale for as low as $2, which is basically robbery. There really is no excuse to not play one of the greatest indie games ever made.\nFinal score: 10/10",

The music is SO good. For the past like 3 months this was my main game. There was even some times where I stopped playing with my friends to play this. I did use a controller and directional inputs can be annoying. I spent 7 hours on the 7th C side but it felt SO good beating it. I still am yet to beat Farewell and am trying to get some golden strawberries. I have been able to spend so much time in a game that has about maybe 10 hour story. I will say though I haven't played as much as my steam says it does. The story is amazing and it was even better to me because I had recently overcome my depression. I definitely would recommend this game to everyone especially since it goes on sale ALOT for ALOT. When I got this game I didn't even know it was a platformer. There's so many positive things to write about this game that I have to cut myself off. Great music and story, challenging, and wayy more content than you'd think.",

It's just kind of challenging (at least when trying to get the optional strawberries) and that's about it.\nAt least I don't get the hype around this game and there are way better platformer and games with that kind of story theme out there in my opinion.\n\nI don't find any of the characters at all likeable except for maybe Theo. Even Badeline has better dialogue and better decision making than Madeline. The little bit of \"story\" is more of a slog than anything and the portrayal of depression and panic attacks is 'okay I guess'. I liked the feather scene but that was the only positive story part for me so far.\n\nIn my opinion you don't miss out on much when you don't play Celeste, unless you have that \"speedrunner mentality\" and enjoy dying dozens or hundreds of times until you finally honed in on that perfectly timed series of inputs to reach the more difficult to get strawberries or casette.",

        "review": "An Ethereal Journey Through the Peaks of the Human Spirit\r\n\r\nRarely does one encounter a game as sublimely evocative as Celeste. This isn't merely a platformer; it is a profound odyssey into the depths of the human psyche, an allegory of resilience woven through an intricate tapestry of pixel art. Every moment spent scaling its treacherous cliffs is an exquisite dance of precision and perseverance, delicately balanced between frustration and elation.\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset, Celeste ensnares the senses with its preternatural elegance, each frame a meticulously crafted tableau of wistful beauty. The protagonist, Madeline, is not just climbing a mountain—she is grappling with the weight of her own insecurities, anxieties, and existential malaise. The mountain itself stands as a towering metaphor, a monolith of one's inner tribulations, beckoning the player to confront their own inner turmoil. It is a journey less concerned with the summit than with the profound metamorphosis that occurs in the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay, though daunting, is a testament to the symbiotic marriage of art and mechanics. Each level is a gossamer thread, finely tuned to evoke both a challenge and a narrative. Movement is a symphony of tight controls, where every jump, dash, and climb feels not like the press of a button, but a visceral extension of the player’s will. There is an ineffable harmony between player and environment, as though you are in concert with the very world around you, drawing you ever deeper into its vertiginous expanse.\r\n\r\nBut Celeste does not derive its brilliance solely from its platforming prowess. No, its emotive resonance lies in its profound exploration of mental health, its lyrical approach to themes of depression, self-worth, and redemption. The dialogue is sparse, yet each word is imbued with tender gravity, lending emotional weight to every interaction. The writing is a gentle caress, full of empathy, never didactic, always sincere—like whispers in the wind that carry the weight of lived experience.\r\n\r\nAs for the score, Lena Raine's soundtrack is nothing short of auditory transcendence. The music, awash in melancholic euphoria, ebbs and flows with the rhythm of the ascent, providing solace in moments of solitude and intensity in moments of triumph. It is as much a part of the mountain as the rock and snow, entwined with the very marrow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nIn sum, Celeste is a masterclass in how games can transcend their mechanical confines to become something transcendent, something numinous. It is a paean to the human spirit—fragile, fallible, yet unyielding in its pursuit of self-discovery. To play Celeste is to ascend not only a mountain but the very peaks of what it means to be human, to face adversity with grace and to find catharsis in the act of perseverance.\r\n\r\nFew games have ever reached such lofty heights. Fewer still have done so with such delicate profundity.",

Beautiful graphics, silly mc frfr, soundtracks amazing, sound effects are really satisfying lmfao, and sooo much gameplay and replay content. I suck at platformers, but its been really fun trying repeatedly for 10 minutes on a level bc the mechanics are easy to understand and once you understand the \"intended\" path it checks out.

Bottom line, game was great, loved it. Do give it a try.\r\nTalking about the story, and my interpretation. Don't read this, play the game yourself and have your own interpretation. Trust me, it's worth it.\r\n[spoiler]\r\nI expected the game to be a typical \"yknow, come to live with your unpleasant parts and understand they make you who you are\" which is nonetheless the most visible storyline of Celeste. But I came to understand the other storyline. Even though it may appear impossible and despite the drawbacks and literally fighting against yourself (Badeline being the embodiment of doubt, illness, disabilities etc...) it is still infinitely worth it in the end when you are at the finishing line and can admire the fact you actually did it. The effort and struggle (and thousands of deaths) pales in comparison with your achievement.\r\nAnd no matter the setbacks (ie falling all the way down) it is always possible to reach the summit.\r\n[/spoiler]",

It has some really stunning art, gorgeous & clever soundtrack which is so much more dynamic than I expected. Very likeable characters. Solid writing. A simple yet extremely inspiring story that works so well in tandem to the gameplay.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which... Celeste is a precision platformer so while expected, I must still mention how insanely fluid it feels to play. Interaction is tight, precise & has a great feedback. It's a delight.\r\n\r\nThe game is so full of intricate mechanics that work alone & together very well. For a game where you're only able to interact in so many ways, the advanced movement just goes hard. The way speedrunners push the limits of Celeste is proof of that.\r\nThe game never becomes stale, it continues to be refreshing. All the mechanics are well thought out & put together beautifully. The way they keep building over one another makes it seem as if the whole game was just one giant tutorial for the final Chapter. Heck, even within said Chapter, everything feels like a tutorial building up to the very final screen of the game.\r\n\r\nOverall this game is just perfect. That's not a word I'd ever pair with any other game, even my favorites... so that should further demonstrate just how great Celeste is.\r\nTo anyone who's even mildly interested in platformers, Celeste is a must try. And if you're like me who had never played one before, you should still give it a shot. I did & I have 0 regrets",

        "review": "Personally, I find Celeste the best game I've ever seen. The plot is interesting yet not overcomplicated. The plot is nothing, however, when you compare it to the gameplay itself. Beautiful screens, soundtracks and what caught my eye the most was the chapter selecting screen. The game also has a wonderful progression system which is very friendly for players. It introduces mechanics step by step after the player got familiar with the previous ones. After finishing the entire game you can suprisingly easly install mods, which only take the experience to another level. That's the moment when you realise how much the game has to offer. After 250 hours I still have a lot to do. I bought it for 12$ on sale, but I could easly pay a whole price for this masterpiece.\n(PS: Try not to break your PC while playing)",

For being a 2D platformer it has some of the most breathtaking art design Ive seen from a Platformer Game, let alone an Indie Game. the gameplay is tricky but fun when you learn it and had some parts that were actually challenging and felt rewarding when you figured it out/pulled it off. The music is some of the best music Ive ever heard produced for a game, it fits so well with the theme of each stage and can be played out of the game and still be enjoyable. The story is also very good and surprisingly deep and a little dark for a game like this which made me surprised but I enjoyed it very much. I want to talk about this game so much but I can't talk about it all so Ill leave it at that, please buy this game if you like platformers, its worth the money 100%",

        "review": "Celeste: Scaling New Heights in Gaming Excellence\r\n\r\nIn an era where many games are bogged down by relentless monetization and uninspired designs, Celeste stands as a shimmering example of what happens when creativity and dedication take the lead. This indie gem not only redefines what a platformer can be but also serves as a testament to the power of passion and player respect in gaming. Here’s why Celeste is a must-play for anyone tired of the same old grind.\r\n\r\nGenerosity and Player-Centric Features\r\nCeleste is a shining beacon of generosity in a gaming world often dominated by cash grabs and microtransactions. From the get-go, this game embraces a refreshing ethos: no intrusive monetization schemes, no DLCs locked behind paywalls, just pure content that respects the player’s investment of time and emotion. The entire game is available upfront, and it doesn't try to squeeze more money out of you with additional purchases. The developers, Maddy Makes Games, have also included a robust set of free updates and features that expand the game’s depth without costing players extra. This approach not only defies the current industry trend but also exemplifies a commitment to providing value and enjoyment without compromise.\r\n\r\nGameplay and Mechanics\r\nThe gameplay in Celeste is where the game truly soars.

It will immerse you in the tension and strain of pulling off crazy jumps and impeccable timing. And if you want a challenge, play this game! It's never unfair or overwhelmingly difficult. It takes some patience, good timing and fast reaction time. Grit your teeth and pull through. It's a journey you will want to finish.",

I love pixelated platformers, and this took that to a whole new level, will play this forever, and will never stop.\n\nI have played for 8 hours now and I am still loving it, my advice, don't get stressed and don't give up. Cliche Ik, but do it. I just need to not run too much stuff with Celeste running, which is kind of annoying.\n\nFinished the main game. Beautiful. I am currently collecting a lot of items but every now and then the game keeps completely closing and my computer says 'how would you like to open this txt file', and so I have lost progress a few times, this may just be the fact I am on a Laptop with a GPU that may as well be from the early 2000s, but if anyone else is having this issue and/or knows what is happening I'd appreciate the help. (The game is still a must just make sure you save every now and then)\n\n2 Mins later and it turns out the txt file is the error log and apparently there is insufficient memory to run the application, yay.\n\nI honestly don't care about the memory thing, this game is too good and I've discovered I actually never really run other stuff anyway, basically forget the rest of this review this game is amazing, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.",

The soundtrack is spectacular i even have listened to it before i bought the game so just imagine how immersive it makes the game feel as you progress through the levels. i would highly recommend players to buy the game especially if its on sale like when i bought it.",

The movement is buttery smooth and the introduction of a new mechanic every level feels grounded and keeps the game exciting. A controller is nice but not needed.  If your still reading this review, just buy the damn game already. You won't regret it i promise :)",

Nothing was overly difficult, all the classic platformer mechanics are here, along with some fun original ideas.  I plan to go back for more of the collectibles.",

There is something for every type of player here, whenever you play to 100%, for the atmosphere, or to race yourself. If you are in the modding scene, there are lots of community made levels for all types of people. I have played over 55 hours on console, and intend to play many more.",

        "review": "Recommended, with caution.\n\nThis is an overall good game, but as others have said, it is extremely difficult. The important thing to note is that the overall game-feel is not really like a standard 2D platformer like Mario or Super Meat Boy, where the overall focus is on momentum and flow, it's more like mastering a set of timed inputs, like a really, really long combo in a fighting game. And as you approach the end, you are expected to clear screens that can be over a minute long whilst performing high-precision maneuvers(certain button presses within 5 or so frames of other button presses), in the context of other high-precision maneuvers. If my research is correct, some of the things added into the late game were inspired by speedrunning techniques along those lines, so... yeah. Others have complained about problems like arthritis or repetitive strain injury while playing this game, and this is absolutely easy for me to believe. Consider this: do you want to ruin your health playing this game? Your hands are important, imagine life without them.\n\nTo be clear, the base game is pretty reasonable. The game doesn't start to get as ridiculous as I as saying until the unlockable c-sides, which, while ridiculous, also tend to be short. My main issue is with chapter 9, which is an unlockable extra chapter that is close to as long as the entirety of the base game, but as hard as the C-sides. This shit is just ridiculous. I finished all the c-sides, but not chapter 9, because I just wasn't having a good time.\n\nAlso, this game's story is just... hard to swallow. The plot involves the main character confronting a physical manifestation of their inner emotions. It seems like something a middle-school girl would love. Me though, I was cringing at several points.\n\nThat was a lot of complaining, but again, the base game is very fun. So if you don't mind not fully completing this game, go ahead and grab it if it's on sale. You may want to consider skipping chapter 9 or the c-sides, though.",

It can be pretty difficult at times, but the game always encourages you to keep moving forward and you only have to wait about a second or so before respawning. The story is amazing, told with such finesse through both the dialogue between characters and the levels themselves. I haven't completed the game yet, but I think it's safe to say that if you like platformers, you'll love Celeste.",

        "review": "Celeste is a truly remarkable 2D precision platformer that not only surpasses typical expectations with gameplay, but leaves an unforgettable impact with its story! The game play is some of the best I’ve seen, with each level being entirely separate from each other alongside its focus upon the perfection of a rounded scope rather than a broad range of capabilities. The artwork and music for the game both work in tandem to create a gorgeous experience for the senses whilst you dedicate yourself to the nearly unforgiving challenge the game has to offer. While the base game is very challenging, each stage’s bonus levels alongside the very final stage are a true test of commitment and knowledge, taking the skills you had learned and forcing near perfection in many of its stages. This culminated with the final stage being by far the most difficult platforming challenge and one of the most difficult video game challenges I’ve ever had the honor of completing. The achievements are almost entirely relegated to that of completing each stage, bonus stage, or collectable within the game, with there being a few others strewn about. While this would normally make the process of 100% completion easier than most, the simple fact that the game itself is so difficult makes the process of completion a true test of skill and a grueling challenge for those truly committed! \r\n \r\n10/10 to play | 10/10 to complete",

I'm playing on keyboard and it was awkward at first I had to re-map my buttons but now that I'm used to the controls its the best feeling game I've played. \n\nIt is definitely a hard game, and I usually bounce off those but the process of figuring out how to get through a part and trying to execute it well enough to get me through made it fun to get stuck in that process. (I've never played any of the fromsoft games BUT) I think the feeling that I got after beating B sides may be similar to what people talk about when they beat fromsoft games. But yeah, if you really don't like difficult games this may not be for you. \n\nThe story is eh for me, but easy to skip through! Plus I think its good to have mental health awareness which this game has.\n\nOverall: A masterpiece, and deserving of all the praise its gotten. It's now my favorite game, I've never had this much fun in a game, honestly... not even in co-op ones. It's that good. If there's nothing about this game that you think you wouldn't like, I recommend you get it if you can. Have fun!",

However, hidden under the surface are the real challenges that will put you to the test. If you go out of your way to collect the hidden levels known as B-sides, the game turns up the heat to see how far can you really go. Celeste really brings home the message of not giving up, to keep going even if something feels impossible. I am very glad to have played this game & enjoyed getting every single achievement.",

Truly an unmatched platformer in terms of game feel and consistency, paired with a touching story, gorgeous pixelart, and one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time. Celeste's base game is the full package.\r\n\r\nI am however, disappointed with the post-game content's implementation. After playing through a small bit of it, I just decided it wasn't worth it. From what I've seen online it only gets significantly more difficult and its locked behind going back and 'completioning' multiple levels from the base game. If I have to look up tutorial videos just to unlock more of the story, I'm really just not interested. Its unfortunate but I was mostly here for the vibes and story and was satisfied enough with the base game.",

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.",

I had never been a precision/puzzle platforming type girl, in fact, other than Hollow Knight this is the only platformer I've ever finished. Celeste is one of the most accessible games out there, with a whole suite of accessibility options to make the game easier without barring you from ANY content or achievements, although I highly recommend playing without them. Don't let the accessibility options fool you into thinking this game is easy though, Chapter 9 (all of it) and the C side remixes of each chapter (specifically Chapters 3, 6, and 7) are far and away the most difficult thing I've ever done in a video game. I absolutely never thought a game like this could make me ugly cry, but it does. Every time. \r\n\r\nThis memorial is dedicated to those who perished on the climb.",

        "review": "Amazing game.\r\n1. 9 Chapters, 8 of them having harder variants that are shorter but extremely difficult.\r\n2. Music is amazing. Trust me, if you don't want to play the game, at least listen to the ost.\r\n3. Movement feels great. In early game, you know how to jump, climb and dash. Late game they expand your moves using the original moves, and it feels amazing to control.\r\n4. Almost every death feels like your fault. There are very few that feel slightly unfair, but you should learn to avoid it.\r\n5. Satisfaction. The levels are difficult. I spent 2 hours on a secret room that was VERY late game and when I beat it, it was the most satisfied I had been playing the entire game. Even now I still struggle on it but only takes me around 10 minutes.\r\n6. For the steam version, there is a modding community. Allowing you to make your own levels VERY easily, play other levels, there is even a mod to play multiplayer online with random people. You can chat to each other, do challenges together, teach each other tech, I even saw a group of people attempting to get one of the hardest secrets in the game (not dashing in chapter 1).\r\n\r\nIf you took the time to read this review, there is a lot I have left out. Just play the game, it is amazing. You won't regret buying it, whether on sale or not. I have over 60 hours in this game (steam is only 18 of those) and all of it was worth it.",

However, rather than shove frustrating things in your face like long game over screens and fear of losing lives, the game chooses to give you infinite lives with an instantaneous respawn. The more you die, the more you learn - and the lack of having to wait after deaths helps you lock things into your memory. Deaths are tied to the room you're currently in, rather than having the possibility of losing several rooms worth of progress. The progress in this game seems gradual - what I mean by that is one room will make you learn a new platforming skill that you'll need in the next one and so on. It's pretty nice, and means the game isn't going to suddenly throw some mario bros kaizo stuff at you before you even learn how to walljump.\n\nThe game overall is very smooth too. If you need to take a break, saving and quitting takes like 2 seconds as the screen smoothly transitions back to the main menu. The soundtrack and graphics are both beautiful as a bonus.\n\nWill Celeste still be frustrating? I mean yeah, it's a platformer. But I've found that when I play it, I don't really rage like I have with other platformers in the past. It's more of an annoyed \"alright time for a break lol\" as I save and quit.",

It's story is simple but very well told, acompanied by a great sound track. If you don't plan on doing the B-side, definetly check the soundtrack somewhere at there are some bangers there!\r\n\r\nThe pixel art is great and the game aesthetic ensures that this will age wonderfully. The art of characters portraits and everything else is also very adorable with a strong sense of identity\r\n\r\nFor those that want a challange... Boy oh boy does this game provide! As i played, more and more extra and bonus levels opened up and the dificulty kept ramping up! But as the dificulty increased so did my skills - That's a testament of how well made the levels are. Everything is fair, doable and with tight controls you know you're almost always at fault for dying - And at all times i never felt \"This is impossible\". So keep going at it and you'll be able to do everything!\r\n\r\n",

Some of its mechanics are actually quite clever while others leave much to be desired. Overall, I like the game and think it's fun. Though the story and protagonist are slightly bland and I don't see how the story is inherently about anxiety outside of a few on-the-nose interactions between the protagonist and antagonist, I believe the gameplay carries the game far better than the story does. As for other factors such as the score, though I personally dislike Lena Raine and her music, I believe the soundtrack she developed fits this game well. For anyone who loves platformers, I'd recommend this title as it's fun while still being decently challenging, even if slightly overrated. Irrespective of whether or not one likes or supports the developer(s), I believe anyone who is interested in platformer games should give this one a go at least once.",

One thing that I love is that the story connects directly with the gameplay, It's all about not giving up, I almost have given up trying to get the moon berry, but I feel like the game taught me not give up and keep pushing yourself. Another thing that makes it so great is definitely the soundtrack, my GOD it's PERFECTION, Lena Raine has really outdone herself making this ost, by the way my favorites are Farewell, Resurrections and Heart of the Mountain. I bought this very recently, in the steam summer sale, for 1 DOLLAR, like WHAT, it felt like I robbed these developers. If you read all of this and didn't buy this, go do yourself a favor and buy it.",

Yes, even the advanced platform mechanics you'd think would be only fit for speedrunners will be taught in due times. Challenges gets harder with every possible leverage but it never gets really unfair. \nNo matter how seasoned or novice of a gamer you think you are, Celeste has a challenge to propose at your own pace, a higher summit to climb and push your limits.",

The music is wonderful. it somehow fits the scenery of each map while perfectly conveying the feelings of the protagonist at the moment, all while matching the adrenaline rush style of the game. However, more than any of these things, the biggest thing that made me love this game... was the story. The protagonist and her struggle. The mountain and the metaphor. Everything is told so eloquently and effortlessly. I cried. Without spoiling anything, this game deserves to be played for the story itself. I absolutely loved this game and highly recommend this to anyone. Be warned though, this game is HARD.",

It tackles it's themes wonderfully, however there is one fatal flaw with it. And that is the fact that it is UNPLAYABLE, and i dont mean the difficulty, i am talking about how it interacts with a controller (which it is clearly built for). Frequently i just stop moving midair when i start moving in a diagonal direction. I love this game, but i just cant experience it without using assist mode when i attempt the third B side or beyond, which still doesn't fix the issue. The platforming is too precise to allow such issues to persist. I was originally going to make this a negative review, but i just cant bring myself to do so on this wonder of a game. Overall, it would be a 10/10 from me if such things weren't an issue.\" and i want to tell everyone that this is bull, his controller is just cringe. 11/10 game, best 2d platformer i've ever played. go leave a \"not helpful\" under his review it'd be really funny",

But seemingly the more you die, the more you figure out what to do.... its very very well made <3\r\n\r\nQuick hands and reflexes are necessity but wits to explore and figure out puzzles is also an important trait to have.\r\n\r\nStory is about inner demons in many forms, be that in Madeline ( the main character ) or in the NPCs you encounter.... a story you can either relate to or learn from... Atleast for those willing to ...\r\n\r\nEither way, its an excellent game in every aspect <3",

You will most likely die dozens or even hundreds of times over the course of the more difficult levels. Usually there are many checkpoints so this is not as bad as it might sound. Certain sections can be quite frustrating though, so this is not a game for the impatient.\nHaving played the original Celeste, this is a huge improvement. New mechanics, more expansive and challenging levels, and better graphics. This has everything I could want and more.\nThe story is nice also, but more of an afterthought compared to the gameplay.\nHighly recommend this to anyone with a taste for 2D platformers.",

This game had a TRUE emotional impact on me, and I loved it SOO MUCHH\n\nAlso as someone who has raged at cuphead, this game DOES NOT MAKE YOU RAGE. Yes, it is very challenging at times, but because of its quick death, every room-checkpoint style gameplay, I've never really raged at this game. Granted, there are VERY difficult challenges to overcome in this game, if you're willing. I don't think this game is very hard to beat, but it is very hard to master, but it's so worth it and fun. It's very open and helpful to new players at the beginning, and segways them so well into each next chapter. By the time you beat the game, you're way better at it than you've probably realized!!\n\nSILLY ANXIETY RIDDEN GIRL HIKING MAGIC MOUNTAIN :3",

I stopped trying to collect all the strawberries in each location and only went for the easiest ones I could.\n\nWhat I liked? Hmm, the graphics surprised me. They're done in a pixel art style, but it suits the game very well. As for the soundtrack, not all the music appealed to me, but that’s a matter of taste.\n\nBy the way, the game has a story, and I must say it's quite good.\n\n[h2] Walkthrough assistance. [/h2]\n\nOn some levels, I couldn't figure out how to progress and decided to check out how others were completing them. However, I noticed that some locations are slightly different. So, if you don't know how to pass a level, you can take a look, but don't be surprised if the level varies in some places.\n\n[h3] Disappointment [/h3]\n[spoiler] In the \"Farewell\" chapter, where you have to find 5 keys [/spoiler] i had to stop playing because I realized I couldn't collect the remaining 2 keys because of the difficulty in obtaining them :((\n\nP.S. [b] The game's age rating is suitable for everyone [/b]  \nHowever, children  \"7-15 years old\" might not have the nerves, patience, or determination needed to complete the levels and chapters.\n\nFor everyone else who enjoys challenging games, I definitely recommend testing your skills in this game and conquering the mountain ;))\n",

I messed around with them for ages in the settings, trying to find something that felt comfortable (e.g. changing movement from arrow keys to WASD and changing the dash/climb stuff to the right hand) but nothing felt right.\n\nIf it was changed so that you could use the mouse (left click, right click, scroll wheel) in the key binds it could be a lot nicer to play. If I could make climbing left click and dashing right click for example, I'm sure it'd be fine. But unfortunately, we can't do that.\n\nPerhaps some mod exists to do that, or there will be an update for this some day, in which case I'll reconsider, but I'm afraid that until then it's not for me.",

The environment feels like a polar opposite to hollow knights darker tone, and i feel like seeing the contrast and also similarities truly shows beatiful and in depth indie games can be. This game is not about climbing just a physical mountain. Youll realise that soon enough",

But gating progress IN THE A-SIDE behind a mechanic, that does work only once in over 70 tries (wave dashing) and then combining that with the second worst mechainc of this game (vertical dashing), which only works every so often IF you have the time to concenctrate on it thus mathematically gating you in ONE screen alone for HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS of deaths is one of the worst thing that has ever been programmed in a non-survival game. Who ever designed and programmed vertical dashing should never ever design and program a game again, for the sake of gaming. This one mechanic alone is worth it to downvote this otherwise absolute amazing game.\n\nYou were so close to perfection. Why did you have to ruin it?",

This isn't just a game, it is as I said a full experience! Lets see the honest critiques I have on this game to hopefully get you to truly realize what experience you are looking to invest in now.\n\nPositives:\n- The gameplay is peak and so is the level designs, characters and art.\n- It has very calming, detailed and lively colors, levels and art\n- The music makes you fall in a very calming state of mind and the sound effects couldn't be better!\n- The game got great progression and it has a learning curve that isn't to steep and not flat either making the learning experience smooth and gradual. These two make you hooked on the base game and the complex mechanics behind it.\n- Movement here gotta be the best movement i have ever played. If you know your stuff then you will be rewarded and all the inputs feel fair and sight readable when you start understanding it.\n\nNegatives:\n- Half the people in the dislike rating say Celeste is too hard. All I can say is it truly isn't. As I already mentioned, the learning curve is not to steep to make it \"too hard\" as they say, yet it's not flat either making the learning experience smooth and gradual\n- Some chapters are very much like mazes, making you walk around a lot and very understandably not finding the one clue or key left to continue to the next room. This is understandably very frustrating and even left me frustrated for the time being. \n\nHowever it does make up for it, as there are just a few spots of such. So don't let it stop you from continuing climbing the beautiful Celeste Mountain and get the game now while it's on a huge discount. If it's not on discount as I said now then don't worry as these discounts come on this game every so often. Just wishlist it and wait for the next one to come.\n\nI enjoyed this a game a bunch and I can guarantee that you will enjoy it too. Have fun!",

The pixel art graphics always look very nice. The soundtrack of this game is AMAZING. I cant overstate how much I love the music in this game, and it also fits to what is happening in the story perfectly. The story is written very well, and the main character will be relatable for a lot of people. But you cant forget that this game is VERY hard, and you WILL die a lot. This might discourage some people, but it is still very fun regardless. And another thing I love about Celeste is the community. It is very welcoming and everyone is very nice. Probably one of the best communities out there. Overall this game is very worth playing if you like platformers, and if you dont, you should still try it out, maybe you will change your mind.

And I hope that many more people who play this game will have it resonate with them, like it did for 17 year old me when i first played it.",

It combines excellent puzzles and challenges with great characters and storytelling about mental health.\r\n\r\nCompleting Chapter 7 by climbing the mountain is worth it, and you CAN do it! And after that there are two more chapters and a whole set of challenges.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to get into it, Celeste is one of the best speedrunning games out there as well.",

Pixelart graphics in this game are really well done. \nMain character's animation was smooth and I felt I was in full control of the main character throughout the entire game. \nGame's soundtrack is amazing. Each chapter has its own music and melody, which adds a lot of vibe to the environment. \nThe game is hard especially for me, who doesn't play platformers much, but that didn't stop me from finishing the game and i believe you could do it too :).",

It can certainly get frustrating at some points, but that's why the assists are there. They are a lovely bit of game development that make the game accessible for everyone, and I did make use of them on occasion. Overall, this game isn't in a genre I favour, but the reason I kept going, was easily the story it chooses to tell.\n\nI heavily relate to many of the themes in Celeste... the metaphorical ones at least, I haven't climbed any mountains. The story is incredibly symbolic, and allows for many interpretations depending on who you are. If you're a fan of literary interpretation, this will be a great game to dissect afterwards. Not everyone will have the same interpretation, [i] but let anyone have a journey [/i], and they'll come away with something, I'm sure.",

Its a masterpiece that is so good that I know this even though I have not even beaten it! Its a solid 9/10 for me (but easily agitated people may get too pissed by it though).",

Despite your death counters going up faster than a slot machine hitting the post mortem jackpot, it never once discourages you from diving headfirst back into whatever sadistic death-trap of beautiful level design that ensnared you in its grasp. Every detail of this game, from its music, graphics, secrets, story and sound are all beaming with love and tremendous care from the devs. If you hate this game you will appreciate it, if you love this game you will relish it, if you are curious about the game, buy it. On sale this game is the best 5 bucks you will spend in your life (not verifed).",
