        "review": "For me, this is the best survival-horror game. There`s the playground when you can do whatever you want. Poison yourself with random plants and berries? Go on. Build the goddamn Big Ben? You surely can. Hunt cannibals and mutants to become the Doom Slayer on this island? As you wish. Set up traps for your dear friends? You got this, but i got no friends to play the Forest with, so i terrorize cannibals families.\n\nHorror aspect in this game is really impressive. I`d never forget my pure fear when you have to run through the whole forest filled with half-naked wild dudes in the middle of the night. But there`s something more scarier - caves. This game made me realize that i have speluncaphobia. It`s dark, wet, there`s bunch of creatures, human remains and unsolved mystery about this island. By the way, i recommend to find the rebreather at first, because some of places in the caves are submerged and if you jump into the water without the rebreather - you will die, suffocating in the darkness. The rebreather gives you air with air tanks and also gives you the internal flashlight.\n\nBut despite all horror stuff, if you play the Forest with friends - it will be the pure comedy. I haven`t experience in the multiplayer, but i`ve watched Markiplier`s video of playing this game. In other words, you will suffer, but with joy and most often not your joy.\n\nSo, about my experience - i played more than 100 hours. What i was doing? Spent days sitting in the base becuase i was so scared of exploring the caves. After fight with my own demons, i start to explore them. After that, i never was the same, i went wild. I`ve decided that i need all achievements, all side tasks, ALL in this game. And i still didn`t complete all of this. After finishing the game, after 150 days in the game (not real days, like \"day\" in the game`s time) i got interested in the lore of game and this is awesome, didn`t expect so much details. \n\nI highly recommend the Forest to play it just once and feel the beautiful and terrifying atmosphere of this game. Don`t forget to invite friends and set up the trap in front of the plane. This is the important ritual.",

The base building seems to exist just to scratch an itch for those who want/expect such things. \n2. The story and world building is a mess. The game tries but fails to immerse me in its world but I find it all very unbelievable.\n3. The world is beautiful, but kind of dull and repetitive. There are some interesting places in the caves, but nothing really wowed me. I find the peninsula that the forest takes place in lacking character. \n4. Combat is frustrating, dull, and just not fun. The bigger mutants felt like annoying chores rather than actual threats. \n",

        "review": "The team behind this game did a good job.  It's competent, some of the systems work, and at first it was very engaging. \nAfter the initial shock of the game's story, and figuring out the basics of survival, the design flaws start to reveal themselves.  \nThe story demands urgency from the player, you child is kidnapped by murderous cannibals and the evidence of their evil is everywhere.  It's quickly obvious that every other person has been killed, and as the days of exploring, surviving, and fighting for my life dragged on in The Forest, I grew more and more frustrated with the lack of any sort of movement closer to my main goal of rescuing my child.  After a time it became obvious that if the premise of this game were true at all, that he would be long dead by the time he could ever be rescued.  \n\nThe systems of this game force you to slow down and be cautious, but the narrative demands speed and efficiency and that tension isn't something that can be sustained over the course of a 20+ hour first time play-through.  \n\nIn addition, base building seems to attract enemies more than it protects you from them, making the survival elements of this game incredibly confusing.  Totems that should act as warnings and deterrents to your enemies seem to enrage them, defeating the whole purpose of engaging with any of these systems.  \n\nI really wanted to like this game but it's systems aren't thought through well enough.",

        "review": "Ah, The Forest—the survival horror game where you crash-land on an island, gather supplies, and try not to die. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. Because the moment you think you’re getting the hang of things, TIMMY is still missing, and those cannibals? Yeah, they’re not exactly friendly neighbors.\n\nOne minute you’re peacefully chopping trees to build your log cabin, and the next you’re running for your life as a gang of creepy, half-naked dudes charge at you like it’s some twisted island sprint. And don’t even get me started on the mutants—because nothing says “survival” like a giant, fleshy spider-thing sprinting at you in the dead of night.\n\nBut let’s not forget the real star of the show: TIMMY. You spend the whole game looking for him, yelling “TIMMY, WHERE ARE YOU?!” and questioning your life choices as you dig deeper into this horrifying island. Spoiler: TIMMY’s got some... issues, and finding him doesn’t exactly lead to a happy family reunion.\n\nThe Forest has all the memes. It’s a game where one moment you’re a master builder, and the next you’re screaming like a baby because you accidentally set yourself on fire… again. Also, if you play with friends, be prepared for the chaos that follows when you realize one of them has no idea what they’re doing and the other just threw a Molotov at your newly built base.\n\nRandy Rating: 4.6/5 — Great survival game, even better panic simulator. TIMMYYYYY! (Oh, and try not to set yourself on fire… too often.)",

The cannibals and abominations are fun and can be intimidating. \n\n2. Dead babies.\n\n3. Crafting is unique and feels like I'm doing something to perform the task. \n\n4. Being able to set how dark I like games. I find that too many games I can just wander around like I have night vision and wait for mods to make night time darker. \n\n5. Traps are cool. As a survivalist in the real world passive hunting is my go-to for consistent meals. \n\n6. Graphics are decent. \n\n7. The sound is great, especially when I can hear a thumper off in the distance and think \"oh shit, gotta hide\".\n\n8. Eating cannobals.\n\nThe neutrals. \n\n1. Sleep does not matter. Literally I can eat myself to staying awake. There seems to be no apparent downfall for not sleeping. It is just a mechanic to advance time. \n\n2. I can build a tree fort with a rope and the cannibals can't climb up, but a platform with no rope they climb up with ease. \n\n3. \n\n",

I recently got a PC and instantly purchased this game, i seen it through streamers a long time ago.\n\nIf you are wanting a horror themed base building game then this is for you! The base building in The Forest doesn't seem like a chore either, its more of a reward when building. The enemies are scary and there is so much lore and secret caves to explore, the best part is you don't have to do it alone! This game is amazing co-op, working, screaming, and running away together is the best part for me. Hunger and Thirst aren't that big of a deal either once you get the basics down. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who wants a survival horror experience with a friend. PLENTY of play-ability and things to do even after you beat the story.",

        "review": "I haven't played this game in years, and after the disaster, which is Sons of the Forest, this game is such a refreshing and satisfying joy to play.\n\nThe map is of perfect size, not too big, not too small, making traversal actually enjoyable, unlike in Sons of the Forest, where getting from point A to point B is just a 55-minute chore.\n\nBuilding is also better by a long shot. Simply press B, select what you want to build, fill in the blueprint, and done! Unlike Sons of the Forest, where you have to position yourself perfectly, otherwise you won't be able to place the log or whatever where you want it, and where a simple miss click can waste a perfectly good log.\n\nCombat is more or less the same.\n\nI am genuinely baffled as to how did the developers manage to make better cutscenes here than in Sons?\n\nThe story is actually grounded and makes somewhat sense, as opposed to Sons, where everything just seems randomly thrown together.\n\nThere's no Kelvin. +2550 rep just for that.\n\nThere's no \"bad guy for the sake of having an antagonist.\" Any entity that can be assigned that position in this game either has a motive, reason, or some other means of justifying their role, even if that justification isn't entirely valid, unlike Jianyu in Sons. And no, him being an undercover agent for Sahara doesn't automatically justify him being a heartless bastard who has no regard for his fellow agents' lives.\n\nBut I digress; there are plenty more things at which the original is better than Sons, but I think these get the message across more than sufficiently enough.",

I personally bought it on sale but, retrospectively looking, even the full price would have still definitely been worth it considering just how nice of a game it is. Yes, it has quite a few bugs and can get a bit annoying, but that's still rare, and is entirely outweighed by the sheer quality and effort put into it. Also taking into account that it's made by Endnight, a studio that is far from a huge Triple A title, in my opinion it is a way better experience than 50% of the crap big companies throw at us now year by year.\n10/10, definitely worth it if you are looking for a relatively cheap survival/horror game, EVEN BETTER WITH FRIENDS!",

        "review": "TL,DR: Too many small issues combined spoil the game experience, which had potential.\r\n\r\nPlayed this through for the first time in 2024, solo.\r\n\r\nFirst, the game should've been called \"The Huge Cave System You'll Spend Too Much Time In And All Your Light Sources Suck\".\r\n\r\nSecond, it's not a bad game, but is one that actively refuses to be loved, at least when you're playing alone. In multiplayer, I guess it's more about having a fun time killing cannibals and defending your base. But in solo, when you're trying to immerse yourself in the world, survive and progress the story (which is by the way not great, but not terrible either), it's 50/50 engaging and disappointing. A few examples follow.\r\n\r\n1. All nodes and items respawn on game load. Including food, medicine, booze and soda found in the starting location. So you can literally never, ever run out of those if you just keep picking things up, saving then loading again. Which makes farming instantly useless, and the entire \"survival\" part of the game very dubious. Why even bother.\r\n2. In solo play, base building is completely pointless, as it is with majority of similar games: you need to move around the map to progress the story, and there is absolutely nothing you can build on your base which you cannot find elsewhere. No point in settling down at all.\r\n3. The story is partly hinted at by appearances of a certain character in certain places when you first reach them. I've never seen him because I was busy fighting off things, or it was night, or it was raining, or I was simply too fr away. So when I arrived at the endgame location, I was chronologically confused and literally had to consult the Wiki on what happened.\r\n4. Combat is challenging until you find or craft a weapon with good Block stat and realize that when you're blocking, NOTHING can hurt you, except the end boss and one more enemy type which I've only encountered twice. Just find a corner, block, then attack when there';s an opening. Rinse and repeat.\r\n5. The hand-drawn in-game map does not exactly correspond to the actual play area, especially if you're using a raft.\r\n6. Physics are pretty terrible and can launch you in the sky and kill you in some cases.\r\n7. The Sanity stat does nothing other than unlocking a new type of buildables. Once.\r\n8. Enemy respawns in caves are inconsistent - they usually don't respawn... unless they do.\r\n9. The plant life section in the Survival guide adds new plants once you find them, but doesn't say whether they are toxic or not. What's the damn point?\r\n10. Quite a few minor bugs like geese swimming through the riverbanks and instantly sinking if you shoot them on the water and you cannot pick up the kill; weapon upgrades visually disappearing after you load the game etc.",

        "review": "Game about defending your base against cannibals where combat equals to poking with a spear, and walking backwards - or using a bow against sporadic enemies that move ridiculously fast. You have 6 traps (although realistically until later you have 4 because of the cost), 2/6 dont work and are more likely to kill you and the others are expensive and take a lot of space to make. \r\n\r\nBase buildling is incredibly rudimentary with few options to choose from (yes you can build in trees and on water, but for each category there isnt much going on). To top it off you can't fit your 1 transport item through the only door in the game you can build, so I guess you have to leave that outside! If you leave even the slightest gap in custom build, the oogaboogas go right through like they can smell your base layout.\r\n\r\nFood and water is a joke as soon as you discover blueberries, or even twinberries (who cares about losing hp, you're gonna have 50 meds stacked up in base anyway). Cooked something finished on the fire? Well, you better eat it! You cant pick it up or store it in any way unless you dry the meat, which then takes more off your water gauge. If there's burnt meat on the fire, how do you remove it? You have to EAT IT! That's right, theres no system to remove shit so unless you want to dodge the icon for the rest of your stay or make a new fire, you better eat that shit.\r\n\r\n\"Explore during the day, defend your base at night!\" Except that isnt true, the cannibals are constantly showing up at your base during the day, and you will run into patrols all the time forcing you into the same tedious combat at all parts of the day/night cycle.\r\n\r\nWhat about progression? Well. thats a joke too. The best item to fight most enemies in the game is literally the upgraded spear, which you make around 30minutes to 2 hours into the playthrough. You can add \"damage\" or \"speed\" to a weapon, but it just reduces the opposite stat, making the DPS the same and the upgrade pointless.\r\n\r\nStory is whatever, finished by a terrible last boss that abuses your lackluster melee capabillities and forces you to spam arrows from range.",

        "review": "The Forest is the survival horror game that throws you into the wilderness with a single message: \"Good luck, you're gonna need it.\" You crash-land on an island full of creepy-ass cannibals, and from the moment you wake up, the game doesn’t just test your survival skills—it tests your nerves, patience, and ability to hold onto your sanity. It’s a brutal mix of survival and horror, where the line between staying alive and getting eaten is razor-thin. And trust me, the game is always ready to push you right over that edge.\n\nThe survival mechanics? Pure savage. You’re chopping down trees, building shelters, and crafting weapons from scratch, but it’s all done with an intensity that makes every decision feel like life or death. You’re always on edge because, while you’re out there gathering resources, the real terror is watching you from the shadows. The cannibals are smarter than you’d expect, stalking you, setting traps, and attacking when you least expect it. And the deeper you go into the forest, the weirder—and deadlier—it gets.\n\nThe atmosphere? It’s a masterclass in tension. By day, the island feels almost peaceful—like maybe you can carve out a place to survive. But the moment the sun sets, you start hearing rustling in the bushes, footsteps in the distance, and suddenly, your flimsy little shelter feels more like a death sentence. The darkness in this game is no joke—if you’re not prepared, it’s not a matter of if you’re going to die, but how horribly. And believe me, the things you’ll find underground in the caves? Let’s just say they’re straight out of your worst nightmares.\n\nSpeaking of caves, if you thought the surface was bad, wait till you see what lurks below. The deeper you go, the weirder and nastier the mutants get. You’ll run into grotesque abominations that look like they were stitched together from your worst horror movie marathon. It’s like the game is saying, “Oh, you thought the cannibals were bad? Hold my torch.” These freaks will tear through you like you’re made of paper, and every time you venture into the caves, you’re praying you don’t stumble upon one of these nightmares on legs.\n\nThe story? It’s deceptively simple at first—you’re looking for your son who was taken after the crash. But the more you explore, the darker and more twisted it gets. The game feeds you breadcrumbs of lore that lead to a mind-blowing conspiracy involving scientific experiments and a creepy cult. By the time you reach the end, you’re left questioning everything, especially after you make that final decision. It’s the kind of story that stays with you long after the credits roll, making you wonder just how far you’d go to survive—and to save the ones you love.\n\nOh, and if you're playing in multiplayer? That's where things get even more chaotic. Surviving with friends makes the whole experience feel like a frantic co-op horror movie. You’re screaming at each other as cannibals rush your camp, laughing as you accidentally set each other on fire, and arguing about who’s brave enough to go spelunking into the next cave. The tension is real, but so is the fun—and nothing bonds a group of friends like trying to survive a cannibal-filled hellscape together.\n\nIn the end, The Forest is a relentless nightmare of survival horror that grips you from the moment you land on that beach. It’s not just about staying alive—it’s about the psychological toll of being hunted, the fear of the unknown, and the constant, creeping dread that something is out there, watching, waiting for you to slip up. It’s intense, it’s brutal, and it’s a twisted ride that you won’t soon forget.\n\n",

        "review": "\"The Forest\" is a survival-horror game created by Endnight Games studio, which draws players into a disturbing and at the same time fascinating world of survival in an unknown wilderness. The title appeared in the early access phase on Steam in 2014, and the full version was released in 2018, gaining recognition among both fans of the genre and critics.\n\nPlot\nThe game begins with a plane crash in which the player takes on the role of a father looking for his son on a mysterious island. It quickly turns out that this place is inhabited not only by wild nature, but also by a tribe of cannibalistic mutants. The story unfolds slowly, gradually revealing the island's terrifying secrets. Although the plot is not developed in a traditional way, the way it is discovered - through exploration, found notes and visual clues - gives it a mysterious and disturbing atmosphere.",

I mean, who knew you needed two sticks for a basic spear? Not me. Also, when it’s dark, it’s DARK. I’ve seen less pitch-black darkness inside a black hole. You’ll find yourself hugging a campfire like it’s your long-lost love.\r\nBuilding a base? Great idea. Except you’ll spend more time defending it than actually living in it. The locals have this endearing habit of visiting at 2 a.m. to have a casual chat… with their clubs. And trust me, they never come alone. It’s like throwing a house party and only inviting the worst people you know.\r\nOverall, The Forest is a perfect blend of survival, horror, and multiplayer chaos. Just make sure you have a strong heart and a sense of humor, because this game will have you laughing, crying, and screaming all at once. And if you make it through the night without peeing your pants, congratulations—you’re braver than I am!\r\n\r\n",

Havent been attracted by any other survival games that much but this one has had me hooked for the last two weeks. The game doesnt force you to do specific things or develop through the story but youll still have to if you want any actual good weapons/tools. Easy once youve gotten yourself some cave loot and built a solid base. Only downside is that once youve been in all caves, completed the story, gotten the artifact ball and built a good base theres not much else to do except for build new things or farm for different items. Overall a great game imo, would def recommend.",

        "review": "The Forest is an ambitious survival horror game that offers an incredibly immersive and atmospheric experience, but it’s not without its flaws. From the moment you crash-land on the mysterious island, it’s clear that the game is going to challenge you, and that’s where much of its appeal lies. The environment is beautifully crafted, with dense forests, winding cave systems, and dynamic weather that make every step feel like an adventure. The sense of immersion is second to none, and the game does a fantastic job of drawing you into its eerie, hostile world.\r\n\r\nThe survival mechanics are solid, and the crafting system is surprisingly deep, allowing you to build everything from simple shelters to elaborate fortresses. This level of freedom is refreshing, and the sense of progression as you gather resources and establish your base is genuinely rewarding. There’s a real sense of accomplishment in crafting your tools and structures, especially when you manage to fend off a wave of enemies.\r\n\r\nHowever, The Forest isn't without its drawbacks. The AI for the cannibals and mutants, while impressive at first, can be inconsistent. There are moments when they feel intelligent and genuinely terrifying, but other times, they can behave erratically, making encounters feel less threatening or downright frustrating. This inconsistency can pull you out of the experience, especially during pivotal moments when you’re hoping for a more intense challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game’s story, while intriguing, is not as well-developed as it could be. There are plenty of interesting elements scattered throughout the world, but many players may find themselves wanting more clarity or a stronger narrative direction. The way the plot unfolds is often vague, and while some players will appreciate the freedom to piece things together themselves, others might feel that the lack of guidance leaves too many questions unanswered by the end.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the user interface and controls can be clunky at times, particularly when navigating your inventory or crafting items in high-pressure situations. This can be especially frustrating when you’re trying to manage resources quickly or defend yourself from enemies, which slightly dampens the otherwise immersive experience.\r\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings, The Forest remains an engaging and memorable game that excels at creating a tense, atmospheric environment. The sense of isolation, coupled with the ever-present threat of danger, makes it one of the more compelling survival games out there. For all its rough edges, it offers a unique and rewarding experience, especially for those willing to overlook its imperfections.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a fan of survival games with a touch of horror and are willing to embrace the game’s quirks, The Forest is definitely worth playing. It may not be perfect, but its ability to deliver both beauty and terror in equal measure makes it a standout title in the genre.",

You will have some intriguing interactions as you bhop off rocks and trees. or you can keep speedyrun on and pretend you know speedrunner tactics while your stamina never goes down.\r\nThese are my personal recommendations for the multiplayer experience if you have or can't beat the game to add some replayability. \r\n\r\nAlso, you can clip through the final golden keycard door by crouch jump attacking the thin sliding door to skip the bossfight if you want the take-the-plane-down-Homelander-style ending. Otherwise you might want to get the golden keycard.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nThe Wise Mystical Tree.\r\nSignature:\r\n\r\n智慧的神秘樹\r\n\r\n\r\n",

From the first moment you land on the island, you feel that mix of tension and curiosity.\n\n**The great thing** is the immersive atmosphere. The graphics are spectacular and the sound of the environment really makes you feel like you are there. Every noise in the jungle can be an indicator of danger or an opportunity, and that keeps the adrenaline high.\n\nThe survival mechanics are deep and rewarding. Building shelters, searching for food and resources, and facing cannibals is an exciting challenge. Every decision you make has an impact, which adds an extra level of strategy to the game.\n\nPlus, the freedom to explore is incredible. You can choose to follow the main story or get lost on the island, discovering secrets and creating your own path. The feeling of discovery is unmatched.\n\n**However**, what really makes *The Forest* great are the moments of tension. You never know when you'll encounter an enemy, and that uncertainty makes every playthrough unique. It's a game that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nIn short, *The Forest* is a game that perfectly blends survival with horror and exploration. The experience is immersive and exciting, making it one of my favorite games. Definitely worth playing!",

Going down into caves with just a flickering bic lighter struck a genuine fear that I have never experienced in a game before. There is so much depth and detail for a seemingly simple game. I have played it on console and now pc until i grew bored from overplaying. Would probably be a blast with friends but I typically game solo. If you need help or care for a solid content creator pertaining to The Forest, I highly recommend Farket on YouTube. He is the forest goat. Play it, it is worth your time and money. Play at night for additional heebie jeebie factor.",

Walking alone though the forest (at night) is scary as it should be.\nYou as a player are never OP, so enemies remain dangerous thoughout (and somewhat unpredictable). \n",

        "review": "[h1]The Worst Place To Crash Land[/h1]\nThe Forest is a survival horror video game developed and published by Endnight Games. The game takes place on a remote heavily forested peninsula, where the player character, Eric LeBlanc, must fight off cannibalistic monsters, while searching for his son Timmy after a plane crash. \n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ATReviews]Follow My Review Group Here![/url]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]About[/th]\n        [th]Description[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]💾Graphics[/td]\n        [td]I love the visuals in this game. The trees swaying in the wind, the amount of dense grass and sense of dread is just incredible. Animations are really impressive, even for today's standards. Destroying trees is somewhat immersive, moving items, and using your tools all look really well done. The lighting is also amazing. This game truly gets dark at night, which just adds to the immersion and fear factor, especially since you have crazy natives trying to kill you. The inventory menu is so cool too. It has this immersive backpack system that shows all of your gear in real time. Kinda hard to explain, but looks so good. For a game to release in 2018, it looks really good![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]Gameplay is pretty in depth for what it is. This is a survival game, so you have to watch your hunger and first meter, and craft items to survive. Base building is in the game, and it’s absolutely well done! I’m actually really impressed with all of the mechanics. Creating a base feels rewarding, and makes you feel much safer! The base can be damaged and destroyed, so be aware of this fact. Hunting animals is really fun, crafting items and upgrading is rewarding as well. There are no perks, just pure gameplay and simple progression. You also have cave systems around the map, which play a huge role in story progression. These caves are dangerous, technical, and scary! Be prepared before going into these caves. Also the AI are actually pretty good and act dynamically, also really scary at times. There are some issues though with the game. Many of the weapons and items you find to progress never change locations when starting a new game. This creates little replayability in my opinion if you are looking for a challenge (when it comes to exploring and progression). Also enemies do not spawn in the caves from what I saw. These are mainly the only issues I have with the game. Besides that the overall gameplay is fantastic.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]📜Story[/td]\n        [td]Story mode is good. I enjoyed the story a lot. It’s engaging, compelling, and just overall super interesting and unique. The amount of lore around the caves, boats, and other areas gives you an idea of what happened on this island. The game also offers a lot of foreshadowing and clues as you progress further. The ending is pretty challenging to reach, but so worth it![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]Multiplayer plays really well. No connection issues, and works like a charm. Having up to 8 players, this game offers a seamless multiplayer experience that is optimized, so no worries about online issues. The game will get super easy with more people though, so I would probably recommend 4 players if you want a good balance of difficulty.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]\n        [td]The game is around 15-30 hours of playtime for your first playthrough depending on how you want to play it, either you rush or take your time. Since the items aren't randomized, expect your second or third playthrough to be much shorter. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]🎧Sound[/td]\n        [td]Sound design is incredible. The ambiance of the island is amazing, also hearing the natives at night is so terrifying. The caves also sound so spooky. The devs did such a great job with the sound design. It’s filled with dread, and makes you feel like you are being watched constantly.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]\n        [td]The game does have some annoying bugs. AI pathing can be a bit buggy at times, and placing items around can be annoying (but this issue is uncommon). Luckily, I didn't have any game breaking bugs, like quests or any sort of progression.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]🔅Performance[/td]\n        [td]Performance is really good! I was getting around 100 fps constant on max settings and had no crashes. If you have a mid range PC, you should be okay. If you have like a GTX 1070 or higher, you can this run this game flawlessly.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]✔️Pro’s[/td]\n        [td][list]\n\t[*]Amazing exploration \n\t[*]Sound design is incredible\n\t[*]Story is unique and amazing\n\t[*]Visuals still hold up really well\n\t[*]Crafting system is simple and rewarding\n\t[*]AI are dynamic and unpredictable\n\t[*]Caves are scary and well designed\n\t[*]Original and fun inventory design\n[/list]\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]❌Con’s[/td]\n        [td][list]\n\t[*]Buggy experience at times\n\t[*]Enemies don't respawn in caves\n\t[*]Key items not randomly respawning in different playthroughs can be exploitable and can ruin replayability\n[/list]\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]🏆Rating[/td]\n        [td]8.5/10\nThis game is worth full price.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]\n        [td]The Forest is such an incredible survival game that offers such an incredible and unique story. Being able to play with friends as well is just amazing! The heavy atmosphere, haunting enemy design, and amazing mechanics and base building all adds to making an amazing experience for anyone wanting to get into a scary survival game. This is a must buy for sure! It’s fun, scary, and can offer a great experience for many!

I've read all the issues and complaints online, including some of the \"fixes\" folks recommend by adding/importing files.  I knew it was a console port, but I refuse to go to that much trouble to make a 2018 game playable (to me) in 2024.  Even the resolution keeps changing.  I set it and it switches to another different resolution every time I launch the game.  This game feels unfinished to me.  Glad so many love it, but it's a waste of money (and time) to me.  Where's the Kleenex?!",

This game is like being trapped in a never-ending fever dream, except instead of weird aunt Mildred, it's cannibal mutants trying to eat your face off.\n\nPros:\n\n- I've finally found a game that makes me appreciate my own apartment's lack of murderous island inhabitants.\n- My survival skills have improved significantly (in-game, at least).\n- I've discovered new uses for sticks and rocks (hint: they're not just for decoration).\n\nCons:\n\n- I now have PTSD from being chased by 10-foot-tall mutants with a taste for human flesh.\n- My friends think I'm crazy for building an in-game bunker with 17 layers of traps.\n- I've started hoarding canned goods and building a real-life bunker (just in case).\n\nIn conclusion, The Forest is like that one weird cousin at the family reunion – it's messed up, but you can't look away. So, if you enjoy living on the edge of sanity, play The Forest. But don't say I didn't warn you...\"",

        "review": "\"A Thrilling Survival Experience\"\n\nThe Forest is a masterclass in survival horror, offering a unique blend of suspense, exploration, and strategic gameplay. From the moment you crash-land in the eerie, mysterious forest, the game pulls you into its haunting atmosphere. The setting feels alive, with day-to-night cycles, weather changes, and a vast, open world filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered.\n\nWhat truly sets The Forest apart is its balance between survival mechanics and immersive storytelling. Building your shelter, scavenging for food, and crafting weapons feels intuitive yet challenging. The constant threat of cannibalistic mutants keeps you on edge, but the game gives you enough freedom to explore and develop your survival strategy.\n\nThe horror element is executed brilliantly, not through cheap jump scares, but through tension and the unknown. Each encounter with the mutants is intense, and their behavior feels unsettlingly real, adding a psychological layer to the gameplay.\n\nFor those who love survival games with a dark, atmospheric twist, The Forest is an unforgettable experience. The game rewards creativity, exploration, and resourcefulness while keeping you hooked with its gripping storyline. Highly recommended for anyone looking to immerse themselves in a terrifyingly beautiful world where every decision could mean life or death.\n\nCreated with <3",

Finding the son of the protagonist and finding out what happened to the plane passengers are the biggest among them.\n\n Cannibals and mutants encounters along your exploration adds the horror setting to the game. But with the crafting introduced we can build almost anything to stay safe. The biggest things needed to progress is exploration of Land and Cave structures. \n\nTo simply say this game follows similar mechanics like Minecraft. Daytime is best for grinding, night time is for hiding from mobs.

        "review": "Excellent game. \r\n\r\nI think the classification as a \"Survival\" game is a little misleading. I think that makes you think it's going to be like Valheim or Minecraft where you are survival crafting and there is definitely a degree of survival crafting but I think this game is first and foremost a Survival Horror game. You do build a base, you do grind cutting down some trees. But, once you are a little bit established that entire aspect of the game takes a backseat to figuring out the story and spelunking in the caves. \r\n\r\nThe compelling part of this game is the story and the atmosphere. Being put upon this place and slowly getting clues as to where and why you should go to deeper and darker places makes it a fun game to explore. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the \"clues\" could be pretty unclear. I did get to a point where I knew exactly what I needed but couldn't find it. I went back through the caves like 5x and only eventually found what I needed - I had just simply missed it. \r\n\r\nAlso, while this is very fun to play multiplayer that absolutely takes all of the atmospheric tension out of the game. I think the proper way to play is single player. \r\n\r\n9/10 game, can't wait to play SoTF",

I got to the end of the game just to be slapped with a game breaking glitch and I'm left not able to do anything. This game is absolutely great and fantastic, absolutely worth the play but because of these problems it's left a semi sour taste in my mouth.",

You will explore dark caves , forests , plains.\nThe region is infested with CANNIBALS that want to eat you.  You can craft a camp , weapons , buildings , tools , etc.. \nWatch out during the night. You can encounter some ABOMINATIONS.  All have different attacks and behaviors ( pro tip : they don't like FIRE ).\n\nYou can play this game solo but it's so much better with some friends.  Overall good game.",

        "review": "I never played multiplayer and I don't care much about building, so if that's what you're looking for maybe this isn't the best review for you.\n\nAdmittedly I don't play many horror games, but this was always scary.  The combat was so hard, and the caves so intimidating, that I gave it up for almost two years until I decided I needed to finish more games and finally beat it.  This would be an absolute nightmare to beat without a guide though.  This is a possible scenario: you get all the way to the final boss, but can't open the door because you missed a hard-to-see item in a room full of corpses in one of the ten cave systems.  There are more than ten cave entrances though, and they can be hard to spot.\n\nSo in short I'd recommend it just for the vibe.  Now a list of minor complaints.\n\nCombat: I killed the final boss first try and it didn't even get through my armor.  I still felt like any mutant could potentially kill me though, and unless you get headshots *everything* is hard to kill.  (Babies can be hard to hit, but all the other cannibals/mutants are tough).\n\nThe Sleeping System: One time while hunting rabbits, I had to flee to my boat because a couple of mutants I'd never seen showed up.  Then it got dark, but I couldn't sleep because my bed only had 3/4 rabbit furs, and your character will not lay his head on anything less than four.  You should be able to sleep whenever/wherever you want (unless of course enemies wake you up).  I went AFK while waiting for the sun.\n\nCrafting: It can be hard to see or identify certain things on the crafting table, e.g. wristwatches because the explosives are covering them up.  Keybinding is annoying too.\n\nThe ending (no spoilers): If you choose the \"wrong\" ending of the two (and it's not obvious which is which), you don't get the achievement.  Why do something like this?  At least there's a save point not that far away.",

I recently went back to this game, after playing Sons of the Forest, in order to get the last few achievements I needed. I found that the game is not as good as I remember. The forest is really only a game for those who like building. The combat isn't hard , nor is it flashy. The enemies are just annoying and boring. Plus it isn't hard in terms of actual survival either. There isn't any sense of progression at all. Its good only for 1 playthrough because you have no idea where anything is and how the game works. Once you learn the game it quickly becomes boring. So unless you have friends to play a multiplayer game with, or like big tedious building projects, then I would not recommend this game to you.",

Then this game is for you.\nYou crash land on an island, instead of respecting the new environment, your plane already littered the island with trash like luggge, clotes, electronics and balls, along with the people that came before you; you cut down trees, kill the local wildlife, plunder their homes, tombs and caves, all the while constructing your castle with a nice view, and when the locals protest you can just chop them down with a katana you found on THEIR island and make MEAT armor using their abnormally large peers, whom they do not discriminate against, mind you, that already makes them better people than you are and THEY ARE THE BAD GUYS???\n\nJokes aside, this is a good survival horror with some quirky game mechanics that makes me laugh. You cannot just drop an item to share with others, you gotta put that on a tray and then offer that to other players like you are a Japanese salary man presenting your card to another salary man as greeting. you cannot just boil water to get fresh water, nope! gotta wait for the rain. When you kill and skin a bird you do not get feathers, you gotta chase the birds around until they drop feathers, which is not enough times that would not make you frustrated. Other than things like these, the game is pretty good, fun when played alone or with friends, but horrifying when you gotta go face to face with the natives but dont have enough to do. I cannot tell much about the story as I have not explored that much yet. Will do when i finish.\n\nPotato recommends if you want to play a survival horror that is light in size, yet has enough things to make you come back to it (the game is not a potato btw, but runs on mine on ultra low)",

The gameplay loop is amazing and i have had so much fun playing this without really exploring the story that much at all. I love to build bases, sorry timmy",

        "review": "**The Forest Review: Cannibals, Crafting, and One Wild Ride**\n\nThe Forest is like a camping trip gone horribly wrong, and honestly, it’s one of the most thrilling survival experiences you’ll have without actually getting lost in the woods. You start off with a crash landing on a mysterious island, and instead of enjoying some peace and quiet, you’re thrown into a nightmarish scenario where you have to fend off cannibals, monsters, and the occasional creepy cave-dweller. It’s like the vacation you never knew you didn’t want.\n\nLet’s start with the survival aspect. The Forest isn’t just about building a base and crafting tools; it’s a full-on fight for survival. You’ll need to gather resources, build shelters, and make weapons—all while dealing with a host of very unfriendly locals. The crafting system is deep and satisfying, with a ton of recipes and blueprints to discover. And trust me, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of crafting a makeshift spear out of sticks and rocks just in time to fend off a nighttime attack.\n\nThe real charm of The Forest comes from its atmosphere. The island is eerily beautiful, with dense forests, hidden caves, and stunning vistas that are all too easy to get lost in. The creepy ambiance, complete with unsettling noises and mysterious lights in the distance, keeps you on edge. You’ll find yourself jumping at every rustle and shadow, especially when night falls and the island's inhabitants get more aggressive.\n\nOne of the most intense aspects is dealing with the cannibals. These guys are not your average horror movie monsters; they’re clever, they hunt you, and they’ll make your life a living nightmare if you’re not careful. The tension of preparing for an attack, defending your base, and strategizing your next move adds a whole new level of excitement. The game keeps you constantly on your toes, and the stakes are always high.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the multiplayer mode. Playing The Forest with friends is a riot. There’s something incredibly fun about teaming up to build a fortress, explore the island, and fend off cannibal attacks together. It turns the already intense experience into a cooperative adventure, full of laughter, chaos, and the occasional friendly fire incident.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a game that combines survival, horror, and crafting in a way that’s both challenging and exhilarating, The Forest is definitely worth your time. Just make sure to bring a flashlight, a sturdy weapon, and a friend or two—because this island is a wild ride from start to finish.",

        "review": "Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\nThe Forest is a thrilling survival horror game that offers a unique blend of open-world exploration, crafting, and combat against both the elements and terrifying enemies. From the moment you crash land on the mysterious island, the game hooks you with its eerie atmosphere and sense of vulnerability. The survival mechanics are well-crafted, requiring you to gather resources, build shelters, and find food to stay alive.\n\nThe enemy AI is another standout feature. The cannibal tribes that inhabit the island are both frightening and fascinating, showing unpredictable behaviors that make each encounter tense and challenging. The underground cave systems add another layer of depth and horror, with their dark, claustrophobic environments and more dangerous foes lurking in the shadows.\n\nWhile the gameplay is excellent, the storyline feels somewhat vague and can be confusing at times. The narrative is told mostly through environmental clues and player discovery, which can leave some questions unanswered. However, the sense of mystery fits well with the game's overall tone.\n\nIn co-op mode, the experience becomes even more enjoyable, as building and exploring with friends adds a new layer of fun. Completing the game with friends felt like an accomplishment and made the journey even more memorable.\n\nOverall, The Forest is a fantastic game for fans of survival and horror genres. Despite some minor flaws, its immersive world and challenging gameplay make it a must-play for those looking for a good scare.",

I was sadly mistaken, sure its nothing insane right but its a solid game, the world story telling is where it shines best but truthfully i find the funnest times in it to chuck on my VR headset and kinda RP some Man V Wild BS, the environment setting and story telling utilising this is where you will find its charm.",

Jenachdem wo man auf der Karte spawn hat man leider vor und nachteile weil die Orte für die wichtigen Gegenstände, Feuerwehraxt, Kompass, Karte, Kettensäge sind immer gleich. Um effektiv diese gegenstände zu finden muss man eigentlich auf der Karte rechts untenanfangen und sich dann langsam nach Links und oben vorarbeiten.\r\n\r\nEinige höhlen kann erst erkunden wenn man die Taucherausrüstung hat und die ist einfach sehr schwierig zu finden. Auch ist das Spiel im Alleingang eher nicht so geil.\r\n\r\nab 2 spieler besser 3 oder 4 macht es richtig bock.\r\n\r\nDas Hausing kann man ruhig vernachlässigen wenn man entsprechend ausgestattet ist.\r\n\r\nAm ende wenn man die Story spielt ein sehr gelungenes Spiel auch für das alter.\r\n\r\nReview 2024 - August",

At the beginning, I shat myself every time I needed to explore a cave, but as the days passed, I felt safer inside the caves than at my own house outside. Combining horror with survival is the ultimate panic experience, since getting killed by an abomination can actually make you lose progress, and you will never know when something will attack.\n\nThe setting is amazing, so if you can handle horror I highly recommend playing it. Also, watch the movie The Descent. It’s basically this game type of fear but enhanced.",

(and discovering I like it a lot but not down to put 80h into it)\n\nMy advice? enjoy the journey and don't think about it too much. it's worth it in my opinion even if there are massive holes in the story and design. why? because it left an impression and made me think about it way too much.\n\n10/10\n",

The game allows you many avenues to approach the monsters from outright ignoring them or going Berserk-mode. I also appreciate that you have the freedom to manipulate the game with console commands. \n\nOne of my favorite memories is a session where we played with 'all monsters OFF' and 'PVP ON'; proceeding to form mini tribes and absolutely annihilating one another. \"Why is the bush glowing?\", my friend inquired at the ominous red glow gleaming out of a shrub that held a Molotov cocktail trap directly outside his base.",

        "review": "-In the crowded genre of survival games, 'The Forest' carves out a distinct niche with its blend of brutal survival mechanics and genuinely terrifying horror. As you crash-land on a mysterious, forested island, the game pulls you into a relentless fight for survival against the elements—and the nightmarish creatures that lurk within the shadows\r\n\r\n-At its core, 'The Forest' is about survival. Gathering resources, crafting tools, and building shelters are crucial for staying alive in the unforgiving wilderness. The day-night cycle adds a strategic layer, as daylight offers a relative sense of safety for exploration and building, while nighttime brings out the island’s deadly inhabitants. The game’s open-world environment encourages exploration, revealing hidden secrets, caves, and the story of the island’s dark past.\r\n\r\n-The story of 'The Forest' is gradually revealed through exploration, making every discovery feel earned. As you uncover clues about the island’s history and the fate of its previous inhabitants, the game’s narrative begins to take shape. The non-linear storytelling, combined with the freedom to explore at your own pace, keeps you engaged as you piece together the mystery of the island and the disappearance of your son.\r\n\r\n-Rating: 9/10 - A masterclass in survival horror, with only minor technical issues holding it back from perfection.",

After three nights of solid gameplay, our progress was wiped on the fourth day due to awful server save management.\n\nThe farming mechanics are also painfully boring, making resource gathering feel tedious rather than rewarding.\n\nOverall, the frustrating bugs and poor design choices ruin what could be a great game. \nSave your time and skip The Forest.",

If you are jumpy and prone to jump scares like me then when its night time prepare yourself to be ambushed left, right and center. I only made it through the first night and I thought my heart was going to explode. Even though I'm going to take a break from this game I still highly recommend it. Its graphics aren't anything to praise but don't let that distract you from the overall experience. Good controls, crafting system and ambience. I will probably play this game again with some friends once I've played some other horror games as I've heard its a lot less scary with other people. Overall rating so far: 7.8/10",

I really don't know why, as i hate survival games.\n\nYour plane crashes, and you walk around picking up sticks and other knickknacks until you immediately start carrying the max amount. The game tells you to build a shelter and find water. I can't find anything to build a shelter except some sticks. And I walk around searching for water while being told I can't pick up anymore sticks or rocks. \n\nThere's a book with a billion options for making things, but its so overwhelming to try and look at it all, and I wish you can just click on the stuff and make it in the crafting menu, but instead it just shows you what you can make. I don't know, there might be a way to do it, but I didn't have the materials, so I didn't care.\n\nAnd then I had to stop playing because, you know, real life called. But I can't save because I need to build a shelter to save, but I can't find 25 more leaves and I don't know where logs are at all, so I can't build it, so I have to exit the game and lose what little \"progress\" I made, and that's bs.\n\nIf you like survival games and wasting time, and getting that true feeling of being lost and living real life in a game, then you'll probably love this.",
