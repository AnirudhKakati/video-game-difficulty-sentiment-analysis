The voice acting is also really well done.\n* Fun hack-and-slash gameplay, with variety of builds through the different weapons and Olympian boons you can attain.\n* The meta-progression is motivating. You get to unlock and earn so much in the game, it is a great incentive to continue playing and to get better.\n* Difficulty level tune-able through heat.\n* Great in-game saving options. So easy to stop and resume a game in the middle of a run.\n* If you're especially into Greek mythology and history, this game has so many cute and catty references to various things that you can appreciate.\n* As far as I can tell, this is best-in-class for the rogue-like genre. It was my introduction to rogue-like games and I'm just so thankful I bought it when it went on sale for Hades 2 release. I'm waiting for Hades 2 to come out of early access before playing probably because I appreciated how polished, thoughtful, and fun Hades was. \n\nCons:\n* Worst part of the game is you'll want more. But there is more than enough content.",

It's a roguelike so you get permanent buffs between runs, but the improvements are slow so I found myself sick of doing the same thing. \n\nOnce you get enough permanent buffs to clear it, that's apparently not the end of the story but I just don't have the stomach for it anymore.\n\nAlso, the weapon variety is limited. There are ways to flavour your weapons in an interesting way but it's either another slog to experience them or entirely dependent on which boons you get within the run.\n\nI just cleared my first run and am more than happy to leave it at that before Hades 2.\n\nEdit: the next morning I started playing it again, and I can't get enough. I take it back and my review is now positive.",

The story is well worth the grind, but I understand some don't have the time. I don't know if this game has cheats, but if it does, I think it's fully justified for a person who's done with the game to cheat 10 wins to see the rest of the story. It is just that well written and worth it.",

What stands out the most is the sheer amount of possibilities in combat thanks to the combinations of weapons, blessings, and items you can choose from in each run. Each time you play, you improve and discover new synergies, making it very addictive and varied.\n\nThe characters are very well developed and have tons of interactions, although they are sometimes somewhat random. This can make completing certain parts of the story or unlocking specific dialogues a little slower than expected. However, the base game is just long enough to keep you engaged without feeling too short or too long.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of roguelikes and action games!",

        "review": "Hades\n\nHades is a decent action arcade game, I played exclusively on Steam Deck and found the added perk of being able to suspend and reopen the game anytime really helped getting the game complete\n\nGraphics : I‚Äôll caveat the graphics on Steam Deck may not do justice to those playing on desktop, so I‚Äôll keep this within the context of the smaller display. It played very well / animations where crisp, visual effects equally flawless. I had consistent fps and zero crashes. The art style of hades is more anime than anything else which helps it stand out from the crowd , I liked the concepts of the gods and hades himself, it‚Äôs different!\n\nGameplay: this is where Hades shines, ultimately you‚Äôll be in combat 90% of the time so it‚Äôs where most of the enjoyment comes from. If you‚Äôve played Slay the Spire or Binding of Isaac, you‚Äôll know the principle is progress is incremental every run. Hades actually does a better job then most as the key storyline is so entrenched in you dieing and then being reborn in the underworld. As such you spend a lot of time getting accustomed to the various weapons and perks known as boons. As you progress you‚Äôll become more familiar with those that match your weopon type and playstyle. Personally, I tended to favour the bow and the god Artemis which provided me excellent ranged capabilities. But equally you could combine with Zeus‚Äôs boons for thunder damage. Dodging is a form of attack in Hades, you quickly learn the boons of Poseidon and Athena can win you a run while your weapon is underpowered. \n\nOverall I found the combat rewarding and fairly interesting, ultimately the enemies don‚Äôt change too much until you get to the endgame so I did find that tiresome and got bored after 20+ hours of gameplay. \n\nStoryline: definitely not the most interesting storyline but it was very well told. The concept is Hades‚Äô son Zagreus is trying to escape the underworld to find his mother. As you complete the game you find there is a bit of a twist on what you originally thought was going on.\n\nBy far the best characters to me are Achilles and Orpheus, thier dialogue and storyline are the most original and interesting - Orpheus especially as she has songs she sings which are wonderful to listen to. \n\nMusic: the music is well done and fits the combat and storyline you‚Äôre experiencing, there isn‚Äôt much by way of overall theme but as mentioned before the songs from Orpheus are beautifully composed and helped to list the game to the next level \n\nOverall: solid 7/10 for me, and definitely worthwhile on Steam Deck",

Every run feels different thanks to the awesome variety of powers you get from the gods‚Äîthough the boons do feel a bit underwhelming after some time, especially compared to Hades 2\r\n\r\nThe gameplay loop is ridiculously addicting. Even after failing a bunch of times, you‚Äôre always excited to jump back in, because you‚Äôre always progressing and unlocking new stuff. Plus, the writing and voice acting for all the gods and characters are top-notch. If you love mythology and tight, fast-paced combat, Hades is a must-play. I hope that Supergiant starts the revitalisation of Greek Mythology in gaming and media",

        "review": "I never finished a single rogue like. Couldn't ever make any progress in them. Always lost motivation when dying and starting over again. So i was pleasantly surprised that i liked this game.\n\nI would say this game is much more forgiving than your typical rogue like. There are 4 areas and 4 bosses. You need to complete them all in one run, but you also get to level up your stats and weapons (and they don't reset). There are 6 weapons for you to choose from, and later on (as you finish more runs), you unlock extra variations of those weapons.\n\nMain feature of this game are the god powers. As you go through your run, you collect and upgrade various god powers you find. These could modify your attack for example, like artemis giving your crit chance on your attack, or zeus adding aoe lighting damage to your weapon. But it's more than just modifying your attack. Take artemis for example: there are powers that you give crit chance on attack, there is a passive that increases your crit chance, another bonus that increases your crit damage, another one gives you extra crit damage against armor. As you see, lots of bonuses to modify your build, and throughout your run, you also get to upgrade their level to increase those bonuses even further. Artemis is very good for DPS, but it doesn't have any aoe (which can prove problematic in some cases). In that case, your best bet is to get some aoe from poseidon or zeus (on your dash). You can mix and match, and very often you won't get that perfect build. Sometimes your build will be something entirely different from what you had in mind because you didn't get lucky with god powers. Sometimes you will be entering the 4th boss with a very weak build. It's very rng, but that's just rogue like.\n\nPersonally i finished my first run with a gun and Ares god powers. It wasn't something that i thought would be strong, but ares powers synergize especially well with the gun.\n\nAlso, there are 3 difficulties: story, normal and hardcore, so if you wish for extra challenge, it's always there. Personally i played on normal, and i found it to be a decent challenge.\n\nAlso, there is a story. I haven't played many rogue likes, but i think that's the main difference between them and hades. The the story is well developed here, very intriguing, and acts as a good motivator to keep your playing. It's super intriguing, and makes you wonder what's gonna happen next, and the only way to do that is to just keep playing.",

        "review": "All other roguelike games are pallid in comparison to Hades. The story has more depth than you initially realize, with enigmatic characters dropping tid bits of lore and story as you progress through escape attempts and deaths. There is a great variety of builds to play through. At about 50 hours i have seen a lot of boons and combinations but there is still quite a bit to discover. I still run into new aspects of the gods. I've died about 45 times so far and the story is still fresh. Everyone has something relevant to say, and/or play a part in your story.\r\n\r\nFor a game about immortal death and its constant cycle, this game is full of life. From the protagonist Zagreus all the way to generally reluctant to speak Cerberus. Every interaction has an attention to detail that shows the developers care about keeping to the mythological theme, while still having fun with the concept.\r\n\r\nGreat game i highly recommend, even if roguelikes aren't your thing, this game will stand on it's own.",

What sets it apart from other titles in the genre is its unique upgrade system that keeps every run fresh and engaging. The variety of boons and combinations you can unlock from the gods makes each attempt at escaping the Underworld feel exciting and personalized. I never once felt bored or fatigued, no matter how many runs I attempted‚Äîeach one offered a new strategy and challenge to explore.\n\nThe graphics are stunning, with vibrant art direction that perfectly complements the mythological theme. From the dark, atmospheric chambers of Tartarus to the more chaotic fields of Elysium, every area is beautifully crafted and full of detail.\n\nEven though the boss fights remain the same in structure, they never felt repetitive. Whether it's the intense battles with Meg or the final confrontation with Hades himself, the game does an incredible job of keeping the challenge fresh. The dialogue and story progression also add a layer of depth that keeps you invested in every encounter.\n\nOverall, Hades is a game that excels in every area. Its fluid combat, deep progression system, and captivating narrative make it a must-play. If you're a fan of action games or roguelikes, Hades will keep you coming back for more, run after run.",

I cannot recommend on principle until the totally crap RNG that screws you constantly is rebalanced to stop padding play time.",

        "review": "100% Review\r\n\r\nHades is one of, if not the best roguelike I've ever played. If roguelikes are meant to be played forever, Hades could be played for eternity. The combat has been made so refined, convenient and intuitive for the player that they feel proficient and adept with any single weapon from the moment they pick it up. To add to this, the various weapon modifications you can find throughout a run (i.e boons, hammers,) make you feel infinitely more powerful and unstoppable, despite the game's noteworthy difficulty. The locations are all stunning, complimented by the game's outstandingly eccentric art style; with miniscule droplets of neon color speckled about each and every nook and cranny which turn every room, backdrop and character into something visually interesting, somewhat akin to a painting. Speaking of characters, this game has a LOT of characters, and each of them are compelling and complex, equally so. No spoilers in this review, of course, but the narrative is intricate and dense, while somehow dispelling any fatigue the player may get with its length coupled the repetitious gameplay loop. I would be at fault if I didn't commend the herculean (no pun intended) task of adding roughly 21,020 unique, fully voices lines of dialogue into the game, which elevates the believability and realism of each character ten-fold. Beyond this, there are so many other little tidbits and mechanics in this game that are worth appreciating, too many to list here. In short, Hades is a phenomenal game that breaks the boundaries of narrative storytelling in roguelikes and brings a congenial gameplay loop that seemingly never gets old, supported by a sublime art style which furthers the quality even more. Absolutely worth the price.",

The game-play loop is satisfying and there are so, so many features to find and unlock.

To explain, this game runs off of a death=story progression system, where dying advances the plot. Problem however, is that WHERE you die is important as well. And ill explain I'm not saying this only because its possible, I'm saying it cause it happened to me. \n\nI well and truly nearly beat the game on my third run. There are no warnings, there are no signs that this may happen, but as soon as i died on that third run, the entire story plot leading to where i SHOULD be...was skipped. I had no idea what was going on, NPCs were naming characters id never met. It got completely ruined for me. I had to restart and make an entire new game, and guess what? If you make a new game, and got as far as i did, the game does NOT revert completely. So i would have to wipe my data entirely just to actually be able to experience the game as intended- which was not fun. \n\nSo sure, the game is probably good, to most, but the very fact that its possible to skip SO MUCH of the story at no fault of your own? I cant in my right mind recommend it.",

All characters are fleshed out and fully voice acted. For a very long time it seems like they are not repeating same thing over and over. It always feels like there is something new to be heard, some new conversation to be had, maybe a new quest or secret. It's just fun to walk up to some character and be curios what it will say.\r\nThe combat is fast and fun. Even for an old man like me. I never though that a game can have so much replay value. Every run is different and somewhat random. You can affect the randomness a little bit. The enemy encounters are shot. You can play the game for a few minutes and if you have to go, you can quit and then return to where you were.\r\nCharacter progression is also very well paced. The upgrades you get and not super powerful, but you do feel like you are a bit stronger over time. And then you can slowly increase difficulty each time.\r\nThe bosses are fun and challenging. The levels, the artwork, the music... like I said, I like everything about this game. Sometimes I want to play just 10 minutes, but I find my self playing the game for 3 hours.\r\nAbsolutely recommend this game.",

The seamless integration of story-line into game-play makes  the deep, nuanced characters shine almost as brilliantly as the game itself. The number of voice lines alone could adorn a particularly thick tome in a monastic library, and the care and affection with which each supporting character is developed with oozes from every interaction you have. Game-play is quick, responsive, and intuitive, while remaining challenging and interesting, even after over one hundred escape attempts. Hades, not only game of the year, is a game for the ages, which will go down in history as one of the greatest masterpieces of all time.",

Thank the developers for god-mode because a noob like me definitely needed that to avoid getting too frustrated. The romance development with Megara and Thanatos is wonderful and the main story as well as the side stories are genuinely heartwarming and compelling. The levels and the character art are absolutely stunning and the voice acting gave me chills at times. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone.",

There could also be some more progression in between the mirror and the weapons as it seemed like a grind to me so I didnt do it. Dont get me wrong though this game is great, and one of the few truly good roguelike games out there,",

        "review": "In general, I like it. But I don't think that the game will provide much interest after finishing the epilogue. So, the main strength of it is in its plot, characters, art design, simple combat system.\n\nHades provides you with a very solid mix of action, lore exploring, dialogues and characters progression. The main source of satisfaction for me in this game was the next simple thought: whatever the outcome going to be, there always will be some lore uncovered for me back in the main hub. So even when I died, I haven't felt particularly bad, cause this lore and character progression was perceived by me as consolation prize of some sort. And this is where the game rocks: enjoyable plot progression, character progression in action-packed simple roguelike combat, accessibility for pretty much every player of any skill.\n\nBy calling combat and difficulty progression simple I mean that it doesn't provide you with new challenges or skills to improve as a player (except for dodging and some timing with attacks), but rather some stats disadvantage. And if it would be the only foundation for the game, it would be pretty mediocre to play. But given that this is a game by Supergiant Games which are famous for their art, deep work on plot and character progression, we get what we actually have in this game.\n\nBy finishing the main plot and epilogue I call this game accomplished for myself and I would recommend it for casual players who want to get acquanted with roguelike genre with a substantional focus on a plot. If you're hardcore player who enjoy the games like Dead Cells, Curse of the Dead Gods or something similar, the combat system alone won't get you interested at all.",

        "review": "*Hades is a super mixed bag for me. I refuse to beat it, but hear me out first. I absolutely get why this game has such a dedicated fan base and such high praise. It is a masterclass in roguelike elements and has such incredible aspects to its design. It looks so so good for an isometric game, has such crisp feeling combat, and the enemies are very well designed. However, it is a roguelike. And, unfortunately. I just inherently do not like roguelikes. I hate that, on every single playthrough, no matter what my build is, that i have to fight the same (slightly different) series of enemies in the same order, followed by the same bosses, in the same(ish) levels. I just need some variation. My favorite games, like Elden Ring and Outer Wilds, have such incredibly variable and beautiful changing environments. I value unique environments and atmosphere like that sooo much in a game. That's the only reason I'm choosing not to finish this game. I think it's an incredibly well-made experience, but it's just not for me. Thank you Hades Devs, for the experience, and I wish you well. Jesus, I need to keep chugging through my backlog...\n\nSights and Sounds\n ‚ÅÉ really nice visual style with deep colors, incredible looking environments, beautiful enemy design, and top-tier character models\n ‚ÅÉ the voice acting is a little phoned in, but impressive so many characters are voice acted anyways \n‚ÅÉ the music is incredibly fitting for the setting and style of game \n‚ÅÉ incredibly crisp and nice sounding sound effect \nGameplay\n ‚ÅÉ feels super tight, responsive, and easy to pick up\n ‚ÅÉ also has a super high skill ceiling and a bunch of different ways to interact with the combat \n‚ÅÉ I personally don‚Äôt like roguelikes, it has good roguelike elements, that are robust and dynamic, but i just personally can‚Äôt stand having to play through the same bosses every time to get to the end, it makes me lose my mind\n Narrative\n ‚ÅÉ the narrative idea of Zagreus trying to escape hell is super cool \n‚ÅÉ the greek mythology aspect is super inventive, and ties into the gameplay super well. very well implemented\n\n*my hours are off because I played a bunch offline on my steam deck and it didn't transfer",

        "review": "This game is one of my favorite (maybe my favorite) games I've ever played before. I'm writing this with around 300 hours in and each time I play I find something new. there is so much stuff to do besides just escaping repeatedly. You can create relations with the gods fix familial bonds and my favorite part. make the game harder. Hades consists of trying to escape over and over again just for the sake of fun and to FINISH THE STORY but when the game gets too easy it introduces the pact of punishment which is just so much fun and removes any chance of the game becoming boring. I decided to write a review because the game got way too easy, the pact of punishment got too easy because with certain combinations you can get high heat really fast. BUT i realized this was boring so i tried to go for the acheivments that most people hadnt gotten one of which was to kill the third boss with a certain condition from the pact of punishment that made the game much, much harder. I did this and said fuck it and maxed it out to try the final boss. THE ABSOLUTE SHOCK AND AWE THAT STRUCK ME WHEN MY SCREEN WENT DARK HAS SHOOK ME SINCE. I reliazed this game may not have a masterpeice of a story nor the most beautiful high definition cutscenes  BUT IT IS SO MUCH FUN and this is coming from a guy who played finished and 112% plus full godhomed hollowknight. and that was fun BUT HADES? absolutely amazing worth every buck unless its 60 dollars then dont buy it. wait for sale. absolutely amazing game when you gt bored just max out the heat on the bosses and try ur hardest until you get so scared that you keep going. death till victory.",

From Art to music to character design to voice acting it's all top notch. What adds to the greatness of this game is the play mechanics, how it evolves to match you as Zagreus becomes stronger. This always keeps the gameplay challenging and never stale. This mechanic alone makes the player come back to Hades as the challenges are every growing and fun factor still very high. Just do your self a favor buy this game and see for yourself that this is THE ROUGELIKE  to buy. Simply put it's a class by itself and even better (more fun I mean) than Hollow knight.",

Then this is the game to unload your trauma on.\n\nAcross the Switch, PS5, and PC I easily have over 500 hours in this game. At a glance it doesn't look all that special, but its the most polished, balanced, fun roguelite I've played (and I've played a lot). Its very clear a lot of thought has been put into every aspect of this game, not just that they are great they also blend together perfectly. The music builds up as you go forward into an epic crescendo when you hit the boss, the powerups feel meaningful and balanced and every run has me wanting to try something new, the hand drawn art captures a really unique style of the Gods, the characters are enthralling and the story is very interesting, and the way Zagreus moves feels like a representation of his personality.\n\n I can usually find something about a game I would change, and this one I wouldn't change a single thing.",

I can highly recommend trying out Hades for everyone and for those who might struggle with the combat aspects of the game, there also is an option called \"god mode\" which gives the player time to figure out how to play the game in a safe way.\r\nHades has to be to best game I've ever played .",

        "review": "Games like Hades and Dead Cells were a big step in a new direction for the Rogue-lite genre as a whole: less reliance on RNG not screwing you with player skill overcoming most obstacles. It's easy enough to finish your first run, but it'll take a lot more victories to get the true ending, and then dozens more to get to the epilogue. That's probably the biggest issue with the game: not enough variety and too much grind. There's too many resources, too many relationships to manage, and just not enough focus on the actual gameplay. I probably spent half of my game time talking to NPCs and reading the story as actually playing the game. A ton of work was put into the storytelling, but it would've been nice to have seen as much effort put into the gameplay itself too.\n\nThere's a great amount of skills you can modify throughout the run thanks to boons from the gods, but the main issue that hurts the replay value for me is the lack of weapon options. You pick a weapon at the start of a run, utilizing one of three modifiers (plus a hidden one), and then you're stuck with that weapon's three or four attacks per run. All of the weapons feel good, but there's just not enough options to support the meta grind, especially considering Dead Cells came out two years prior. Adding to the tedium is the lack of randomization throughout the runs: there's only four biomes and the same four bosses at the end of each area. Each boss has some growth and modifiers over time but it still feels very barebones for the genre.\n\nHopefully the sequel expands out the environmental and boss variety because the gameplay-side of things falls a bit short for me. I sunk so many hours into this because I enjoyed the meta progress and pushing the difficulties higher, but it eventually got to the point that, like many other Rogue-lites, I felt like the run was over if I did poorly on a room. Getting the true ending will probably take about 15-20 hours, but \"finishing\" the grind could easily take four times that. A very beautiful and well-made game that's worth the money; just be aware you might get bored of it before you even get the good ending.",

It's highly replayable despite the repetitiveness of needing to restart on death. There's a lot of variation which adds to experience.",

They've executed what they set out to do really well. The art is gorgeous and the characters have interesting personalities, and the gameplay loop is designed in a way that dying doesn't feel like losing. Every run is an adventure and your improvement is paced along with the story nicely. \r\n\r\nSuper recommend. 10/10",

When I got it, I played for a while, but bounced off around 20-40 hours having never beat the last boss.\n\nEarlier this year I came back to it during an extremely difficult period in my life. I don't know what it was, but it clicked; I feel in love.  It was at that time I finally beat the final boss!  I was elated, and hadn't felt that level of accomplishment in gaming in some time.  Even now, having completed the main quest, I still come back almost weekly to see if I can beat the next heat level.\n\nIf you're on the fence like I was, do yourself a favor and get it.  I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.  It will forever hold a place in my heart for helping me through that difficult time, but despite that, it might be my favorite game of all time.",

Greek mythology is a favorite of mine in media, and this does not dissapoint. Zagreus taking center stage is not common, and him attempting to leave Hades' domain is a fun and great concept leading to great enemy variety. Despite having a limited amount of weapons, blessings and modifications/spoiler make it refreshing each run. I beat it on Hell Mode, and despite the great challenge I finally got that addictive \"one more run\" experience. Also despite it saying \"playing with a controller recommended\" I played on mouse and keyboard with no difficulties... Coming from a console player as well lol. With so many lovable characters this game really is more than meets the eye. Definitely a 10/10 game.",

Fairly approachable for casual gamers, but has a customizable difficulty with incentives to go higher; also has a god mode if you find it too difficult. \r\nThere are six different weapons, each of which has four different aspects that affect the way they play. Each is customized via Boons from the gods and Daedalus Hammers that ensure that every run is different.\r\nAlso extremely gay and has a fishing minigame; very important to know.",

Each run through the Underworld feels fresh and exciting, thanks to the procedurally generated levels and a vast array of weapons and abilities. \r\n\r\nBut what truly sets Hades apart is its narrative. The characters are endearing and well-developed, each with their own unique personalities and backstories. The relationships between Zagreus and the Olympian gods are particularly compelling. As you progress through the game, you'll find yourself invested in their stories and eager to see how they unfold.",

What really sets it apart is its narrative‚Äîevery time you die, it feels like you're uncovering more of the story and building relationships with the brilliantly written characters. The balance between challenge and progression is spot on, making every run feel rewarding. Hades is a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed roguelikes with a deep, engaging story.",

        "review": "[h1]Stunning visuals, captivating soundtrack, compelling voice acting (yes, Hades himself had me under his spell...), and an intriguing story.[/h1]\n\nThe game delivers loose, fast-paced hack-and-slash combat where you can upgrade abilities as you progress. Different power-up combinations (boons) work better together than others, but overall, everything feels viable. For seasoned roguelike players, the early stages might feel a bit easy‚Äîeven button-mashing can get you through, until you meet certain bosses. But eventually, you‚Äôll need to start learning enemy patterns and strategies. Since the game lets you ramp up the difficulty later on, it‚Äôs best to start mastering movements sooner rather than having to relearn them later.\n\nThe story draws heavily from Greek mythology with a few creative liberties, but these changes blend seamlessly into the narrative and go largely unnoticed.\n\nEven if dying doesn‚Äôt always enhance your permanent stats or unlock new weapons, it can still push the story forward with one character or another, so you never feel like your effort is wasted.\n\nAnd I have to point out the OST and voice acting, especially. What a work of art.\n\nThis is an absolute gem of a game. I highly recommend it to both roguelike enthusiasts and fans of Greek mythology.",

        "review": "Hades is very clearly the result of everything Supergiant have learned from all their past titles; combining a distinct and beautiful visual style, excellent music, high quality voice acting, compelling characters and a captivating storyline. \r\nIt is an excellent roguelike with sufficient challenge to keep you interested but, most importantly, a continuous sense of progress, no matter if a run results in failure. \r\nEven after hundreds of hours I was still impressed that I was finding new dialogue/storyline or things to purchase/unlock, meaning that I was always keen to go back and even looking FORWARD to failure sometimes. \r\n\r\nCombat is fluid and feels punchy, with a selection of weapons that will feel familiar for those that have played Bastion in particular, but it is altogether more polished and refined. \r\nIt is well worth trying everything out for a few runs to see if you find a play style you didn't anticipate liking.\r\n\r\nThe perks and boons keep things very interesting as you adapt your loadout to what you are offered and let you plan some different tactics.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism is that you can get away with button bashing for longer than perhaps you should (especially with good boon/perk combinations) and I took longer to unlearn bad habits to overcome the later bosses as a result.\r\nFor comparison - Hollow Knight makes it very clear early on that you will not defeat bosses by button bashing and need to observe telegraphing / attack patterns to succeed. \r\n\r\nI also thought the mythological setting was used well and it inspired me to read up on the 'real world' mythology behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the Hades experience as it gave me sufficient challenge to want to keep coming back, and the run lengths were perfect for smaller bursts of playtime over lunch breaks or whenever I had a spare hour or two in the evening.\r\nI would heartily recommend this to anyone that likes isometric action/combat and would even suggest that people that aren't normally fans of roguelikes give it a try.\r\n\r\n",

Just remember that death is not the end... you'll be rewarded.\n\n",

Add in the water, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes while mixing occasionally. Add in the flour, stirring with a large wooden spoon until well blended and forms a ball.\r\nTake off heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes, or until just warm to the touch.\r\nWhile dough is cooling, heat oil over medium-high heat to 360¬∞F (180¬∞C).\r\nOnce dough has cooled, add one egg, quickly beating until completely incorporated (it will look like it's not coming together, but keep beating)! Add in the second egg and repeat the process until a dough forms.\r\nScoop dough into a strong double lined pastry bag with a large open star tip nozzle. (I suggest using Wilton 1M or Ateco 845/846.)\r\nCOOK CHURROS\r\nLightly oil the blade end of your scissors and set aside. Carefully pipe 5-6-inch long strips of dough into hot oil, cutting the ends with oiled scissors. Fry 4-5 churros at a time to avoid over-crowding your pot.\r\nFry until golden browned, about 2 minutes each side. Transfer to paper towel lined plate for a few seconds, then roll in the cinnamon sugar.\r\nRepeat with remaining dough.\r\nServe warm with melted chocolate or caramel sauce, fruit or ice cream.\r\nNOTES\r\nTips:\r\nTo make sure your churros turn out perfectly, make sure you prep everything before you start. \r\nUse oiled scissors to cut your churro dough. \r\nINGREDIENTS:\r\nINGREDIENTS\r\n\r\nCOATING\r\n¬Ω cup sugar\r\n¬Ω teaspoon ground cinnamon\r\nCHURROS\r\n4 ounces butter\r\n1 cup water\r\n2 tablespoons white granulated sugar\r\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\r\n¬æ teaspoon ground cinnamon\r\n¬Ω teaspoon salt\r\n1 ¬º cups all-purpose or plain flour\r\n2 eggs at room temperature",

I wish there were more of a middle ground, but unfortunately, it leans more towards a thumbs down for me. [/h2]\n\nArt Style: 9/10\nGameplay: 6.5/10\nMusic: 5/10\nStory: 4/10\n[h3][b]Overall: 6.5/10[/b][/h3]\n\nIm fully willing to admit that my dislike of this game could be because it's my first Rogue-Like, but what seemed as a Gold Standard for Rogue-Likes, I was very underwhelmed. The repetitiveness of the game makes it a slog, the slow progression makes it even more of a slog. The story is really nothing good either, and yes Im comparing it to all the other masterpiece stories I've played because there does not need to be a bad story because of it's art-style or being a rogue-like. The Punishing Difficulty Spikes are worse even compared to Elden Ring, which I don't believe is good gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is nice and satisfying, but I cannot be pulled into the game. Repetitive Dialogue, mediocre story that doesn't engage the player, I believe the game was too over hyped for me from other people that when I began to play, it became just a tedious repetitive experience. But perhaps that's what Rouge-Likes are meant for?",

I might as well play a slot machine if I'm going to do that. \n\nAnd the reflexes you need to dodge, attack, do magic, is all too fast.

        "review": "So, Hades.\n\nIt's a roguelite, so let's just rip that bandaid off right quick. Not a roguelike. The game has no intention or expectation of you to get a clear on your first run. It is possible, but you'd need foreknowledge of certain boon combinations to get it done as well as a lot of luck to get those boons in the first place.\n\nThe structure of the game is simple. You start by entering Tartarus, and fight your way to the surface. Every time you die, you come back to the house, where you stay until you decide to enter Tartarus again for another run. When you are at the house, you can advance side plots and such by one 'point' basically if the relevant NPC is available, by talking to them. It's chance-based, whether or not they are present, busy, or absent. Sometimes this is not just a mandatory dialogue to progress the side plot, but a literal point, as you feed NPCs a collectable to gain +1 relation points with that individual.\n\nBecause of this rigid, lockstep pattern of dying, coming back, progressing in this way, the game also sees fit to at certain intervals unlock a new trick you can use to progress - some sort of roguelite-style axis for enhancing Zagreus (the guy you play as) and/or his equipment. \n\nThat means there's a bunch of passives you can unlock that permanently make your guy stronger, and you can buy upgrades to the world itself that make your life significantly easier by adding random gold spawns to rooms in the dungeon part of the game, and enhancing the amount of life restored by fountains, adding fountains to be found during exploration and not just at each checkpoint between areas, and so on.\n\nEventually, you will win. That's the point where you feel a great victory has occurred, but in reality, once you get your first win, you realize pretty quickly that not only is this just going to be the first of many, you have to win at least a dozen more times or so to actually see the conclusion of... basically the first act of a 2 act structure story, I suppose.\n\nSince you can only earn so many things per run I think that Supergiant probably sat down and did some equations to figure out how reasonably long it would take a player to get through the game, because so long as you are engaging with all the games systems, the progression feels pretty rigid. There are clear beats too where, you might just start to feel like a certain tedium set in, and then the game unlocks something new for you. This is something of a positive I suppose.\n\nOne of the big things that struck me early on is, Hades basically tries its hardest to fill every run that you play with something new so it always feels fresh, sometimes it's just dialogue or something like that, and sometimes you're rewarded when you get back to the house with a new unlock or such. These are gated sometimes by how many clears you have or when you get certain dialogue to appear.\n\nBecause you can only have one conversation per NPC once you return to the house you are pretty hard gated to progression at a certain pace. It's a steady pace, and I was engaged in playing the game for a good long while so that was enough to keep me going.\n\nUh, anyway aside from all that talk of the progression systems, which I feel I am not quite fully encompassing here, way at the bottom of the pile of interesting things to talk about, is the actual game itself. I think I soured on the gameplay over the course of the last 40 hours of my time with Hades, which was spent mostly farming for the last few achievements, and the resources to obtain them. This needless to say got tedious when there were only a few things I just needed to hit, and winning didn't even remotely matter anymore, and I was using a lot of the same builds not even of my own volition, but just because they were effective and it's what the game randomly gave me.\n\nHowever, Zagreus is pretty responsive to control. You can zip around by dashing for free whenever you want after a tiny brief cooldown, which is intuitive. You can throw a ball of something, which is either on a cooldown or you gotta retrieve it. And you can smack enemies with your attack or use your 'special' attack to do something that is just not attacking. It is fun, and it feels good to play, mostly. Some weapons are more satisfying than others, I think I liked most of them in the end but many feel like they don't truly get to their potential until you fully upgrade them, whereas some don't even require any investment once you have unlocked them for them to be useful. Some weapons are just honestly not good, or too fiddly. One or two weapons are completely and totally broken. So there's some mismatched balance there, but there is a lot of variety to be had.\n\nWhile initially my thoughts about the depths of the boon system were pretty positive, as I came to understand it more, I liked it more, then as I understood it fully I started to like it less, until I get to now where it's like... I know there's basically a small handful of EXTREMELY broken boons that if you put together will dumpster almost everything difficult in the game, especially on certain weapons. And then there's a whole ocean of other stuff you 'could' use if you really wanted. And, on the occasion you want to do something specific, it can be very frustrating if you just want to run specific boons or types of boons, because unless the game feels very kind, you often wind up with, certainly... playable combinations, but, not what you actually wanted.\n\nI think there is something of a tier list for each of the gods that give you boons, especially when it comes to each weapon. There are a couple weapons that can use I think just about any boons and get away with it, and there are some weapons that feel like they really really really need very specific types of boons to work at all, and if you don't get them you are either in for a very long game, or one that will end in you dying.\n\nOf course, even if you have totally mismatched garbage boons, it is still possible to get a clear, so long as your passives are adequately filled out... that's just how powerful those can be.\n\nAnyway, overall I did enjoy my time with Hades, though it overstayed its welcome by a lot and after playing it for 100 hours, I don't honestly see myself coming back to it, because I have seen everything within the game once, twice or many times over, and that is enough for me. It's pretty good. It might even be THE best roguelite I've ever played, the gold standard for all others to live up to. But, still, that's enough for me.",

Hades has high-speed, deeply fun gameplay that encourages both mechanical skill and strategic planning; an engaging, expanding story with unexpected twists; meaningful, progressing relationships with genuinely interesting characters; stunning, bold art; and music that you'll continue to listen to for months after your final run.\n\nOut of my favorite roguelites, I think of Hades as being not only the best, but also the most accessible for players who are strangers to the genre or \"bad\" at games. This is because Hades' excellent narrative and relationship development are woven in between each run, cushioning the blow of failure. Who has the time to feel bad about dying when it means you get to revisit old friends, experience an expanding storyline, flirt with demigods, poke fun at your dad, and pet Cerberus? Because of this and its tight, addictive core mechanics, Hades is one of very few games I genuinely enjoyed sucking at long enough to, eventually, become genuinely good at.",

        "review": "May Contain Spoilers:\n\nI'm not usually a fan of this type of game genre. I was very pleasantly surprised with Hades. It has an extremely high replay value for the first few completions. Having said that, I grew very bored after finishing the game twice and don't really feel a pull to continue playing. \n\nTechnically it has great art, crisp and clean style. Lovely sound design and creative direction in that sense (more on the characters later...) \nThe weapons are also interesting, satisfying and punchy but ultimately I found myself mostly only using 1, which is the machine gun. The other weapons are fun etc but the machine gun with certain permutations is just blatantly broken.\n\nThe gameplay is HIGHLY addictive and has a really cool and unique levelling system that drives creative builds. I'm very pleasantly surprised with how quickly time goes by while playing this. It seems to be the ultimate \"Ok one more quick game\" title in this genre. \n\nI didn't like the take on Greek mythology, I'm personally not a fan of a lot of the character DESIGN, and dialogue. I was expecting something more gritty and akin to the actual stories. I was surprised when the characters came across as something like idealised notions of archetypes reduced and filtered through the lens of a person who doesn't have the experience necessary in life to write compelling VERSIONS of these characters (as ultimately these are just different versions of these same famous characters).\n\nIn my opinion they are too 'cool', they speak with bedroom voices, the poses are all very edgy, there are no truly flawed characters, despite the context. This amounts to them coming across as not real or believable. The 'evil characters' are just portrayed as angry people, and the 'good characters' are just people who show compassion or are the downtrodden. (It should be said that this is a minor criticism when it comes to the full package of what the game actually is/focuses on)\n\nLeaves a bit of a  gross taste and is quite cringe-worthy. Although this is a personal gripe on the narrative and shouldn't necessarily take away from the technical achievements or gameplay of the product. \n\nWorth buying on sale. Fun and addictive with high replay value, nice clean sound design and technical art.\nPersonally don't like the character design and dialogue (nothing to do with the voice actors themselves, they were great performers).",

You got it.\nSome powerups synergize best with others, so don't be lazy and figure that out. It's fun.",

That's pretty cool.\n\n-- Gameplay | 8/10\n\nMany weapons, many styles. The combat system is straightforward and similar to DMC. You may get bored of it after two escape attempts. It all feels the same.\n\n-- Graphics | 10/10\n\nWho doesn't love cartoon-ish graphics? 10/10.",

Nevermind the unlockable weapons and upgrades and handicaps.\r\n\r\nAlso, the worst enemy in the game is not REDACTED or any of the heroes trapped within the underworld, it's goddamn spiders.

It's half combat, half character exposition. Stylish.\r\n\r\n(\"roguelite, though not a roguegrind\": it never gets sure-to-beat, the first few runs will be impossible to fully complete, although in Hades you can still feel progress in those first few runs)\r\n\r\nWhen I started this I never played a rogue-anything in my life. Still not reached the end of the narrative after 111 hours, there's just so much of it.\r\nNow I enjoy some of the games in these genres.",

I replayed hades on PC in anticipation of Hades 2 100% the game for the second time.\r\n\r\nHades is a master of what is really enjoyable gameplay with lots of different options to keep things fresh and to always try something new, but also has a very captivating and compelling story to keep you engrossed in what happens in between. So whether you want to master the gameplay and try your hand at a hades speedrun or deepen your relationships with the cast of characters you're in for a treat either way.\r\n\r\nLastly, in terms of getting all the achievements and 100%ing Hades it's not a bad experience at all. It can take a while but nothing is particularly difficult. I would say if that's your goal make sure you're deepening relationships as often as possible.\r\n\r\nOverall 10/10, if you haven't played this game pick it up on the next sale!",

Maybe you could unlock a resource multiplayer after the epilogue for each heat level?\r\nThanks to that I didn't unlock everything, i left some weapons without the max upgrade and some stuff in the house of Hades, I just ran out of steam by the end of things. But that was fault of my unique sircumstances.\r\nOther than that I really loved the game and my time with it I can't wait to play Hades 2 when its complete. Maybe I'll give it some test runs before release",

        "review": "Another Supergiant game giving me mixed feelings. Hades has good design, fine writing, solid gameplay, great visuals, gorgeous music and outstanding voice acting. It's also chaotic, button mashy (my hands always get sore after a single run), frustratingly random and has pretty stagnant storytelling.\n\nMost of my frustration with this game comes from it being an exercise in patience and luck more than skill or understanding of gameplay mechanics. I find that success or failure are more dependent on getting boons and upgrades that work well together or just fit my natural playstyle, than if I focus and actually try to play well. Some builds work just as well when I randomly mash all the attack buttons as when I'm careful and meticulous. At some point I just zone out and mash, knowing success is bound to come at some point as a function of the player character getting stronger with each run. I also find the story to be pretty unsatisfying, mostly due to very slow pacing. Real progress only happens one bit at a time each time you beat the final boss, until then better get used to Olympians' generic cheers to Zagreus' escape from the underworld.\n\nDespite my frustrations however, I keep coming back for more. Hades might not be a very engaging game to play, but it's still nice to unwind to by playing a run after work. I really appreciate all the artistry and care that went into it, the meticulous design, complex mechanics, outstanding music... It kinda loses me with its storytelling and some gameplay aspects though.",

During some runs, your boons will synergize beautifully, making you feel like a GOD.\n\nI also appreciate how well the roguelike mechanics are integrated into the story, making it feel natural for runs to end, respawn, and then go again. Character design, voice acting, and environment art are all top-notch. Extra special mention to the music; it made me feel things.\n\nMy only gripe is how long it takes to reach the \"true\" ending. Still, Hades sets a new standard for the roguelike genre and deserves a spot in the pantheon of all-time great games.",

Not to mention, the artwork and music are phenomenal. There are so many details in each room. Even after finishing the game and doing well over a hundred runs, I still find myself seeing new things. The story and character dialogue are entertaining and fun. Just overall a really, really well made game. I will be playing this for a long time! Fantastic job, Supergiant Games!",

Mechanically very satisfying to play, great soundtrack, fun writing, and overall a very good intro into the roguelite/roguelike style of game. I've convinced people who don't think they can play games like this to play Hades. For sickos like me, there's a Hell Mode, but some say Hell Mode is a place on earth. Or maybe that's Heaven. Either way, even if the game's set in some version of Hell, it's Heaven for me.",

        "review": "ive wanted Hades for awhile but never got around to getting it until recently and BOY i wish i got it so much sooner! Its a great game in terms of gameplay, soundtracks, art and how the story balances out the gameplay. I've never really played roguelike games until Hades so it was all new territory for me. It was, honestly, really fun dying, getting to progress the silly little visual novel game, then go back out with new skills and knowledge on how to defeat bosses. Secondly the soundtracks are AMAZING and fit the vibe of the game so well. When it comes to games that i replay a bunch, I usually mute the game and play my own music, but I find I have a hard time doing that with Hades. I love he intensity of the soundtracks and it genuinely keeps me engaged, like I dont even wanna play my own music. Also the ART DUDDEEEE!! The art is AMAZING and the general look of the game is so distinct. I'm not much of a greek mythology nerd, just have some general knowledge, but I've never seen the gods depicted like they are in Hades. They're all so unique and beautiful in their own ways, and probably a niche compliment, but I love how theyre all NOT WHITE. As a person of colour, it was  nice seeing some so much melanin and genuinely some of the best character designs ive seen in a hot minute. I also love all the little side stories that you get to explore in your runs, it gives me something to look forward too each run. 10/10 game in my opinion 100% worth it",

The problem with this game, however, is the repetitive like game play loop. \n\nYour enjoyment with this game can be split into 3 sections without spoiling anything. First, completing the game once which your enjoyment is at the peak. Second, the repeating the same loop about 5 times with your enjoyment at its lowest, considering how you always see the same enemies. Lastly, the enjoyment for this game goes up after the story picks up the pace and you try to learn more about its story. \n\nOverall, my experience with this game is positive but finding the motivation to continue playing was rather difficult especially around the 7th repetitive game play loop. If repetitive game play loop is a breaking point for you. This game is definitely not for you.",

        "review": "While I don't play this game as often anymore it still remains to be one of my favorite games of all time. No roguelike has captivated me quite like Hades has and it's one of few games I can say I actively wanted to 100% and thoroughly enjoyed doing so. For a good solid 4 months last year this was the only game I was consistently playing. From the presentation to the music and the art style, to the gameplay and the characters alongside their voice actors, this game is a work of art and I urge anyone who is and isn't a fan of roguelikes to try this game [i] at least [/i] once. Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of roguelikes, only really getting into Hades, Enter the Gungeon and Risk of Rain 2, but Hades grasped me in a way that made me forget about my biases for roguelikes completely. The fluidity of the combat is complemented by the dozens upon dozens of upgrades you acquire in game which are a joy to play around with and play into each other exceptionally, on top of the 6 different weapon types and their alternative versions which can all be upgraded individually. The Pact of Punishment, which essentially serves as a NG+ feature after your first run clear, are optional self imposed challenges that you get to pick out yourself to specifically tailor your run that encourages replaying through the game just for the sake of the added challenge if the main gameplay loop doesn't interest you enough on it's own. The music will worm it's way into your head and cement itself there, I personally often found myself standing still to listen to the music in certain areas, especially when Orpheus or Eurydice were singing. The voice acting is in a league of it's own, perfectly conveying the tone of the situation and the mood of the characters without the need of cutscenes or overly animated character sprites. The art style is clean and easy on the eyes, the character sprites designs exude passion and careful attention to detail for each God, easily representing what each God is about upon just a first glance. I'll hold back on writing about the story but I promise it's just as good as the rest of the game and a great motivation for your runs while also being a relatable story. This all comes from someone who wasn't favorable towards roguelikes to begin with, I knew nothing about this game prior to playing it aside from the main character's name. I would like to think that it means something for a game to persuade someone who didn't care much for the genre to fall in love with this game and find sing praises for it. I hope with my review I can convince at least 1 person to give this wonderful game a try.",

        "review": "Hades has truly redefined my understanding of what a rogue-like game can be. From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by the game‚Äôs breathtaking art style. It combines hand-drawn environments with 3D models in a way that is both striking and functional. Each area of the Underworld is visually rich and distinct, making exploration a joy. Complementing this visual splendor is the game‚Äôs exceptional soundtrack. The music is not just background noise; it‚Äôs integral to the experience, with energetic and emotionally resonant tracks that perfectly match the fast-paced action and darkly enchanting atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe game is packed with content, ensuring that there is always something new to experience. With a variety of weapons and abilities, each run feels different, and the roguelike mechanics keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. This variety is what makes me return to Hades time and time again. Its unique take on Greek mythology is another highlight. Rather than depicting Hades as a purely malevolent figure, the game provides depth and motivation to his character. The story of Zagreus‚Äôs quest to escape the Underworld and reconnect with his family is engaging and personal, offering a refreshing perspective on familiar myths.\r\n\r\nOne of the most compelling aspects of Hades is how it handles death. In this game, dying is not a setback but a crucial part of the journey, unless of course you're that one person that feels the obligatory need to beat the game on its first try, in which case you'll need all the luck you can get XD! Each failure contributes to the story and progression, making every run an essential part of the overall experience. The dialogue and voice acting further enhance the game‚Äôs appeal. The interactions with the gods and other characters are engaging and memorable, thanks to exceptional voice performances and well-crafted dialogue.\r\n\r\nReturning to the House of Hades after each run is particularly satisfying. The hub area evolves with every attempt, offering new interactions and upgrades. This aspect provides a rewarding break between action-packed runs and adds a sense of continuity to the experience. The fluidity of the combat is another standout feature. The controls are responsive, and the diverse range of weapons and abilities means there‚Äôs always a new strategy to explore. Each fight feels impactful and engaging, making the gameplay deeply satisfying.\r\n\r\nOverall, Hades is a standout game that has captured my attention and kept me hooked. Its combination of stunning visuals, fantastic music, intricate storytelling, and addictive gameplay makes it a must-play. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of rogue-lites or just looking for something new, Hades offers an experience that is both deeply satisfying and endlessly replayable. It‚Äôs a game that I‚Äôm grateful to have experienced and one that I‚Äôll remember for a long time to come!",

        "review": "Game is good at first - amazing playthrough, you complete it 10 times and there you have it you've finished it. That bit is perfect and fine. However, it gets worse after that slowly you have to keep playing and playing gets repetitive and easy to unlock other achievements which are RNG based so you can do a whole escape and not get what you wanted so you have to do it again - this aspect I did not enjoy. \n\nWhilst that's said, if you're looking to play this casually for fun then get it. If you are trying to play for achievements and trying to get that 100%, make sure you have TIME. Each escape is approximately 45 min to an hour long, for myself I was able to do this in about 20-30 minutes because of how many time I had done it before just gets repetitive and boring. Overall good game nice art work first 10 escapes feel amazing but after that its downhill.",

The story is also really cool and the way the characters develop over time makes you care about them more than I expected. The art style is amazing. It‚Äôs challenging, but never unfair, and every time you die, it just makes you want to jump back in and try again. Definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves action-packed roguelikes with a great story!",

It was (of course) difficult at times but once you get the hang of the mechanics and find your preferred play style, you can bullrush through the levels with no problem. The art style is gorgeous, with mystery and lore you slowly uncover with each playthrough. The characters are all endearing and the game play is super fast and each weapons you unlock has it's own quirk you need to figure out.\r\n\r\nWhat's fun about this game is that even if you have a play style, each round will be different creating a unique experience to the game. If games like that is something that sounds up your alley, give Hades a shot!",

The combat is great and offering multiple styles of combat and multiple weapons to give you a sense of variety in what could otherwise be a repetitive game. The way the game allows you to customize each run as well as providing some randomness in the power-ups makes this game playable for hours and hours because every attempt feels different. It's so much fun, I couldn't recommend it enough and everyone should play this game.",

        "review": "I've always enjoyed the Roguelite genre, and this may quite honestly be the king of them. Where most in the genre have an amazing hour or two, they tend to fall a bit stale in the mid-to-late game. Not so with Hades. There is incredible depth here, beyond just the sheer variety of weapons, abilities, characters, but even down to the narrative. Every character has a staggering amount of fully voiced VO, with tons of different contexts to trigger them from. You can bump into a character after speaking to a different one, and they will reference that you spoke to the other person. If this were a 3 character game, that would be a lot of work, but there's upwards of 30 or so characters all mixing and matching. The work to make a game of this depth is exhaustive. Kudos to the developer!\r\n\r\nTo the game itself, there's a bit of an upwards climb to get competitive and capable, to unlock the weapons, to increase base stats, but once you've got a bit of a foothold, the gameplay here is tight as a trouser press. The combat is snappy, with great readability even in a ton of chaos. The power range is vast, so each run truly does feel unique. Lots of styles to choose from, close range melee, long range melee, ranged weaponry, it's all here, and with the various upgrade lanes, each of them can be really catered to your particular style (albeit with a bit of RNG, as the genre promotes).\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you like this kind of game, you won't find any better.",

It's simply the perfect roguelike, for both veterans and newcomers to the genre.\n\nThe gameplay is simply flawless, even after 100+ runs, it never gets old. The story is told both during and in-between runs, which fits perfectly with the roguelike gameplay. No run is the same and even after all these runs, there's still plenty of new dialogue to uncover.\nAnd then there are ways to gradually tune up the difficulty in the endgame, even after completing the epilogue. So you can basically keep going indefinitely while the game will keep challenging you.\n\nThe game looks and sounds perfectly, too. Like with all the previous Supergiant games, I couldn't resist playing the soundtrack outside the game.\n\nI will definitely never get tired of playing this. The only reason I stopped playing after all these hours, is to make time for other games.\n\n10/10",

        "review": "This is a great isometric action-RPG roguelite. You are Zagreus and are trying to escape hell from the wishes of your father Hades. Along your travels, you'll get help from various Olympian Gods, in the form of special abilities. You initially just start with a sword, but there are 6 different weapons you'll eventually get to choose from. This part reminded me a bit of another Supergiant Game: Bastion. That said, I wasn't very fussy Bastion, which goes against popular opinion. There are other ways you'll be able to customize your character between attempts at escaping hell.\n\nThis actually feels more like an RPG compared to a typical isometric action-RPG due to all of the dialog in the game and relationship building with NPC's. That said, since this had a fair bit of dialog, I avoided looking things up on the game and some thing which I thought were timed unlocks were not. This lead my runs to be harder than necessary. Additionally, trying to complete some prophecies (quests) made me feels like I was choosing sub-optimal boons and thus, lowered my run win-rates.\n\nThis is all wonderfully voice-acted and is dynamically reacting to various actions that have previously taken place. The graphics/visuals are nice and the music is really well done. In fact, polished is the word that most comes to mind after having played this. I think this was probably considered game of the year for a lot of people in the year it was released and probably one of the best roguelite experiences out there. Definitely worth trying if you like action-rpg's.",

I almost failed a weeks worth of classes in college when I first got the game, and then I replayed it again last year, and now I'm replaying it again because I am waiting for Hades II to be complete before I end up dedicating 80 hours of my life to that one. \r\n\r\nSometimes I lost on purpose to progress story. Not because it progresses too slow but because I really fucking love it. It has something for everyone, and the cadence of the beautiful voice acting is quite comforting and the effort you put into building relationships is totally worth it. \r\n\r\nIf you're shit at games, you'll get better. And even then you have God Mode. And if that isn't enough and you wanna coast straight through it, the files are very, very easy to edit to give yourself an advantage (changing your starting health from 50 to 500, for example). \r\n\r\nNow I'm gonna go back and play it more. Again.",

The way characters and story development are weaved into the runs and home base actually drew me in instead of the usual skipping through convos. Gonna keep going until I finish unlocking all the things and then try out the sequel!",

        "review": "The art is beautiful, the characters are memorable and there is a lot of unique dialogue for the player to find. For example, each time you face the same boss they have something different to say. Each of the unlockable weapons play differently and are all fun to use, my favorites being the spear and adamant rail. However, I don't think the game is a very good roguelite. The route you take is always the same, so the runs don't vary much from each other. The randomized loot you find doesn't affect your playstyle very much, if you compare it to games like Noita or Dead Cells. I found the meta progression tedious (getting darkness, gemstones and nectar for permanent upgrades). I still enjoyed the game and recommend it for anyone, but roguelite fans might be disappointed.",

        "review": "I haven't played roguelike (almost bullet hell -esque) games much at all before, but I decided to give it a go after hearing multiple people recommend it. I went in totally blind ‚Äì the only thing I had seen of the game was a few screenshots on the Steam store page.\r\n\r\nThe start was ‚Äì as one could expect ‚Äì quite brutal indeed! I died and died again and again. But I was instantly hooked and enjoying my Groundhog Day misadventures! It took me a total of 27 escape attempts and around 40 hours in total before my first successful crossing of the finish line. Though certainly victory felt that much sweeter after struggles comparable to Dark Souls!\r\n\r\nEveryone's journey through Hades will be quite different, but if you go in blind and enjoy the beginning, it will only get better as you progress further, unlocking new mechanics and slowly progressing the story. While the gameplay was very, very much different, the general vibe of the game strongly reminded me of Inscryption ‚Äì the card battles being replaced by swordplay.\r\n\r\nTo avoid spoiling anything, I will just say that the story is decent enough and balances out the combat-heavy gameplay very nicely. Decorating your home was a bit of an unexpected feature but admittedly it was one way of ensuring a constant feeling of incremental progress, even in the case that you keep dying for hours before eventually succeeding. It was also a nice way of spending resources without instant excessive power creep or introducing an overabundance of mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe Steam achievements were well thought out, as the majority of them were tied to either completing in-game challenges or progressing the story. Though in the end I wouldn't have minded if there were a handful more of niche achievements that required you to do some unusual runs for example under certain restrictions or utilising some less used mechanics. It was also extremely rare to get all achievements before even going through all of the (minor?) side objectives.\r\n\r\nOne last mention has to be made of the soundtrack and general atmosphere throughout the underworld. The sound design was excellent and I wouldn't mind listening to the soundtrack again even after doing a hundred escape attempts. The artwork also did much heavy-lifting in cementing Hades' unique and recognizable appearance.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Hades was a very memorable, satisfying and fun experience that I might return to again later, even after completing nearly everything that the game has to offer. If nothing else, then to purchase the last pair of missing alternate decorations for the House of Hades!\r\n\r\n[h1]9,5 / 10[/h1]",

Not only does this game have amazing character designs and personal stories, but it also feels incredibly smooth to play. This is by far one of my favorite roguelikes since all the runs are fast-paced, and you can really get enjoyment from the runs, even if you use the same weapons or find very similar boons.\n\nA perfect mix between story and gameplay that just shines with charisma. I really recommend it, although if you were straight before playing it you might reconsider that after trying it out.",

        "review": "Hades is an incredible game that hits all the right notes, especially if you're into rogue-likes. The progression feels so rewarding‚Äîon your first run, you'll probably struggle with the first boss, but as you keep playing and upgrading, you'll start pushing further and further. I've put in about 70 hours and I'm close to getting all the achievements.\n\nThe lore in this game is just on another level. There's so much dialogue and interaction, and it never gets old. Every character is fleshed out, and you can build relationships with them, which adds an emotional layer to the game. Some moments are hilarious, others hit you right in the feels. Plus, there are a ton of hidden twists and secrets that keep things interesting.\n\nGameplay-wise, it‚Äôs flawless. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses, and there's a ton of variety. You can evolve aspects of each weapon, and every form can be upgraded, unlocking even more possibilities. It‚Äôs crazy how much work must have gone into this. Every run feels unique because of the different bonuses, gods that help you, and rooms you have to clear. And then there's the heat system‚Äîadding extra difficulty by giving enemies more health or putting you on a timer. Even the heat system has secrets to uncover.\n\nI can‚Äôt talk about Hades without mentioning the artistic direction and graphics. The art style is just perfect for the game, with so much attention to detail in the animations and effects, especially depending on which gods you get help from. You can also upgrade your base to make it more beautiful and detailed, which adds a nice personal touch as you progress.\n\nAnd the music‚Äîholy crap, it‚Äôs a masterpiece. Every track fits the game perfectly, setting the mood and enhancing the experience. It‚Äôs just another aspect where Hades excels.\n\nHonestly, I might be forgetting a few things because there's just so much to love about this game. But yeah, Hades is a must-play, and I can't recommend it enough.\n\n\nNB1: I think i'm close to stop playing, not because it's bad, but because it's very time consuming, and I have almost all the achievements and secrets. I think i'm finished and I dont want to be disgusted by the game. I think 70 hours is not bad. We will see in the following days if I can stop playing :D\n\nNB2: 74 hours, i'm stopping now. One of my best experience.",

No pixel graphic poo piles here. Even the dreary is beautiful, and even in the mire of these miserable places and grinding playthroughs, the characters themselves are so sincerely and engrossingly endearing that you want to keep going just to see them again. I want to work to give Charon another Nectar he doesn't need.\r\nThey could've just left it at A) Complete the dungeon B) Get the reward choices, but no.\r\nThere is love of effort here. Care for the lore, for the world's development. If you know and care about the mythos of these gods, you'll only be more impressed. Political and family dynamics, vying for power. Think Season 1 GoT level writing. They didn't have to do that. But they did.\r\nThis is so many of the things I keep complaining that these games could be doing, and it somehow seems to do them ALL better than I've seen before. I'm not easily impressed. I even straight up enjoy complaining and tearing a subpar game down.. but this just isn't one.",

        "review": "Hades is a roguelike hack ‚Äòn slash masterpiece that tells the tale of Zagreus, son of Hades, as he tries to escape the Underworld. I can honestly not think of a single flaw in this game and here‚Äôs why.\n\nThe gameplay loop is simple and tight; easy to learn and hard to master. Each run takes between 20 to 40 minutes to finish, although it can end much quicker if you‚Äôre slain by [REDACTED]. Doing a run is fun because the items and Olympian boons you find bring new synergies and strategies. Moreover, as you play you will unlock a whole arsenal of weapons with different play styles. This makes it so that the more you play the game, the better you get at understanding what pairs well and what doesn‚Äôt. I also like how the story and the various feats you have to complete get you out of your comfort zone and make you try new things. \n\nThe game world itself is beautifully realised. If you‚Äôre familiar with other Supergiant games you will feel right at home. I adore the comic book-esque look and feel. Each region feels unique and appropriate given the source material. The various characters that you encounter in Hades are also expertly rendered whether as 3D models or 2D character portraits.\n\nSpeaking about the characters: they‚Äôre diverse, quirky, humorous, and ‚Äî most of all ‚Äî interesting. It‚Äôs one of the best modern spins on the Greek myths I‚Äôve seen. Every time I receive my first boon from Dionysus, I start to smile, man. üçá I think if you have any love for the Greek myths you‚Äôll enjoy this fresh take. \n\nThe story is engaging and interweaves with the gameplay perfectly. What‚Äôs especially striking is how Supergiant has managed to make the characters react to what has happened in your story. It always feels relevant and thus exciting to learn new things about the world during and after each escape attempt. \n\nI also have to mention the absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. Whether it is the rip roaring guitars as you fight your way through the underworld or a soft ballad sung at a moment‚Äôs respite. They fit the game perfectly and the lyrics carry weight and meaning and tell a story on their own. Many of these now grace my favourites playlist on Spotify.\n\nSo, in the name of Hades, if you like to have a good hack ‚Äòn slash time, give this game a chance. You might fall in love and become a fan girl like me. Now I‚Äôm off to hunt together with Artemis while I wait for the final release of Hades 2. üèπ",

I'm no music expert, but my Spotify playlists are full of pieces from the game's OST. I'll let that speak for the quality of the music.\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\n\nMy experience with roguelikes is rather limited. The only other big title I've played is The Binding of Isaac. Comparatively, Hades' story is phenomenal. Its Greek myth themes make the story compelling, but its true strength is in the portrayal of its characters. Zagreus grows and develops throughout the game. Hades could have been a one-dimensional antagonist, but he is layered and believable. The supporting characters all feel unique and have a specific charm to them. You can recognize their lines, sound cues, and their motivations. There are a few romance options (too few if you ask me). However, all of them take the protagonist and their love interest on a journey of self-discovery. The settings are clearly distinguishable by the aesthetic, but also the enemy types and hazards.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\n\nThe developers have outdone themselves by making dying a core part of progressing through Hades. Each death proves you've got a lot to learn, but it also makes you stronger for your next run. You never feel like you're losing in this game and it makes it so addictive. The movement is smooth, although admittedly also too smooth sometimes. One criticism I have is that at times it feels like you're walking on ice, which can lead to some raging in a game as high-intensity as a roguelike. The difficulty is adjustable. You can turn on mercy rules to make it a lot easier if you're a casual gamer or if you find yourself getting stuck somewhere. Alternatively, you can add penalties and handicaps to yourself to make the game harder. This also makes it a hundred times more replayable. I think it took me around 40 hours to beat the game for the first time and probably 20 or so more to fully complete it. A 100 hours through, and it's the first ever game I've earned all achievements on.\n\n[h2] Requirements [/h2]\n\nThe game is very lightweight compared to the requirements we're used to seeing post-2020. The developers have tried to put in as much as possible without making the game have unrealistic pc requirements. I think these constraints forced them to innovate in certain aspects. At the time of writing this review, I'm unable to access my gaming pc. Instead, I completed the game on a laptop I used for university. So, it definitely runs great.\n\n[h2] Price [/h2]\n\nConsidering that most AAA games are starting to charge 60 Euros for an unfinished product, Hades' price point is one of its greatest strengths. For 25 Euros, you get a polished and complete product that you can sink a minimum of 100 hours into. There are no core features hidden behind DLCs, there are no microtransactions, and the game is just what you get. It's reminiscent of how games used to be. You know, how you spend money to get a game, and then you just get the full game. This isn't even mentioning discounts. I got Hades when it was around 10 Euros. Hands down, one of the best game purchases I've ever made.\n\n[h2] Grade [/h2]\n\nAll in all, I give Hades a strong [b]9.8/10[/b]. A nearly perfect score.",

        "review": "You all have no idea how excited I am to talk about Hades. I was already sold on this game before ever playing it just because of the topic. It‚Äôs all about that mythology which got me beyond excited, so obviously it was a must-play for me. I‚Äôm such a sucker for all things mythology. While this was the main selling point for me, it could have also been a deal breaker had they fucked things up. Well, I‚Äôm happy to report that they actually nailed it. \r\nFirst of all, the story is so cool and I couldn‚Äôt wait to find out more. And this is coming from me, a person who usually pays zero attention to the story (literally, I played Witcher 3 all the way through three times and still don‚Äôt know what any of the story was there)! I was very excited to see how bits of mythology got incorporated and how. Which Gods are in the game? What weapons do they have? What enemies are there to fight? Just little details like had me so hyped, I couldn‚Äôt stop playing. That being said, even if you don‚Äôt know a single thing about Greek mythology, this is highly enjoyable. The story does not hinge on you having any knowledge at all, the game is very self sufficient within the frame work of the story while still being framed by all general trappings the nerds like me are probably familiar with.\r\nRoguelikes can sometimes become frustrating with doing the same run over and over again. In this case, it never felt too boring or repetitive as you unlock so many things, talk to so many Gods and Goddesses who have so many different abilities they can give you. Even the different weapons and aspects, the keepsakes as well as other additional influences like the mirror of night can make each run so unique and different. So many things to figure out, to decide what your favorites are, what is good to pair. \r\nEven once you put in a ridiculous amount of hours, unlocked everything, leveled everything up, Hades gives you new options to tweak the game. There are different aspects you can make more difficult if you wish to, so even for those already proficient at the game, there is still a way to make things challenging and engaging. I love the basic level design and even the bosses you encounter but that even boss fights can be altered by this is amazing. \r\nI haven‚Äôt even mentioned yet how pretty Hades is to look at or how great the music is. I spent over 200 staring at this and listening to the music and I‚Äôm still not tired of it. The incredible amount of moving parts to each run that you can modify makes this game super replayable for me. Sure, replayability is sort of the basic idea of a roguelike, but even after I had all achievements, finished the story, pretty much did all there was to do, I still gravitate back towards Hades. I might stop playing for a bit but after I while I reinstall and circle back to it. It really is that much fun.\r\nAlso, bonus points for actually being able to pet Cerberus and for being able to get him toys. Fun fact: there is an achievement for petting him a certain number of times which was the very first achievement I unlocked in this game. (Clearly shows you where my priorities lie!)\r\nI don‚Äôt think there is a single thing I don‚Äôt like about Hades. It‚Äôs definitely one of the games I am most enthusiastic about and that I recommend to people a lot. I more than got my money‚Äôs worth with this one for sure. It‚Äôs such a good game!\r\n",

        "review": "I like Hades. I didn't like Hades as much when it launched, but now I really think I do. \nHades is an action roguelite, where you take a young prince of the underworld on a quest to slay big old Hades. You start out by picking one of several types of weapons and starting trinkets, then bash and shoot through several arenas filled with enemies. \nAfter each arena you get more powers, bonuses, metacurrency or upgrades. Where Hades differentiates itself from several other similar games, is that the there is a wide cast of characters giving you these upgrades, and a slowly unraveling plot. \n\nTo be fair, I do not really care about the plot, even if it is a nice flair to an otherwise fun game. \nWhat I care about is the gameplay, and it's fast and pretty fun!\n\nThere are a lot of difficulty modifiers that open up after defeating the big bad, and each weapon category has their own difficulty proression - so there's a lot to rummage through here.\nRuns are fast enough, at most taking 30 minutes, but potentially less (there's even a time attack modifier!) so you can crank out a run even during a lunch break!\nCombining powers to get strong synergies works well, and there are even special powers that require two specific gods to open up, so there's a good amount of run variety.\n\nHades handles well, looks pretty and sounds really nice. It could have more bosses, more biomes and more enemies, but I guess you can't have it all.",

I can't actually think of anything wrong or flawed in this game beyond maybe some of the weapons kinda sucking (the game came alive for me once I could ditch the sword for the spear)",

Simple to grasp, deep to master, challenging and rewarding, but never frustrating.\r\nFew games can I recommend as much to anyone as I can recommend Hades. 11/10.",

The combat consistently hurt my hands after only a single run, and it wasn't enjoyable enough to compensate for that. It felt repetitive and a slog to get through despite the characters and the story developments. I gave up after getting to the final boss once.",

It is definitely a more than worthy game to pick up for any rogue-like fan. It's even been called a trap since it apparently makes people think they like the genre, but the game is just so good that it will appeal to nearly anyone. \n\nIt is the perfect game for those who need either story progression or solid gameplay as a driving force to play their games. Not to mention the replayability is through the roof with over thousands of builds and quirky combos to try. \n\nThe only possible flaws could be the balance with how powerful and almost necessary Athena's dash is and a few other abilities outshining the others. There's also some weird design choices in making some of the Greek gods Black and making Orpheus a woman, but both of these are almost inconsequential to the experience. Highly recommend.",

        "review": "Diablo x Hyper light drifter. This is a great game. The art style is fantastic, bright colors as you hack n slash out of the underworld. I felt like this game was rather slow to pick up with the combat, putting in around 5 hours till I was convinced it is worth playing through. The combat was extremely repetitive and not very fun originally, but as you develop your character and master the game the challenges that are presented are very real, challenging. There is a lot of depth to this game with builds and their diversity, their potential weakness and strengths vs different opponents. All of this becomes more clear and fluid with time and a very satisfactory, engaging experience. I didn't care a lot for the writing although it is pleasant at times, the prince is my favorite character and I feel like I could recommend this to people looking for a challenging action game, one they could enjoy for a long time to come with a lot of replay value here. I will say the story is somewhat grim, and as I played through Diablo Immortal I felt that had more light moments. The prince to be seems to have a cocky attitude and I think I would have preferred a more solemn character with more of a tarnished persona. There is humor to enjoy in this, ill give this an 8/10 with what I have played through currently. Sort of reminds me of Kratos and Arteus, how Kratos could come across as somewhat off putting. This dialogue not as obnoxious as GOW.",

It is a roguelite, so with each run you will be able to acquire and improve abilities to make following runs a bit easier. If you suck like me, you'll probably die a lot. It'll take a LOT or tries, but it's really worth it.\n\nThe music is awesome, the characters are hot and charming, and the voice acting is great. \n\nEven characters that are supposed to be annoying, like Theseus, will grow on you. Can't take him seriously enough to get mad. Especially after you start wiping the floor with him.\n\n10/10 would recommend.",

        "review": "What a wonderfully designed game. Including characters and monsters of the Greek pantheon, there is so much detailed character design and research that has been put in as is clear from all the voice interactions. The voice actors as well are excellent, with a standout for me being Achilles. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay has plenty of variety from the various weapons you can use, ways to limit yourself in runs, and abilities you can give yourself. Each run will have various different rooms appearing but not completely random so you know how to pace yourself before upcoming bosses. Each Olympian has a clear colour palette and symbols, making it very each to see which abilities are buffed by which Olympian's boon. The only time this looks confusing is when you use those abilities in a Trial against the same Olympian, but even then there are ways to distinguish.\r\n\r\nBetween each run there are so many interactions with character which progress the various quest lines. The quest lines appear as a list of prophecies from the Fates which I feel is a particularly nice touch. Each character feels very mature and fleshed out so that even after 100 runs I hear new things being said.\r\n\r\nThe music weaves its way through all of this with aplomb. From the sound design of the mechanics it is easy to recognise which item has just dropped, to the atmospheric guitars roaring in when a mini-boss fight occurs, the music matches that aspect of the game you are in.\r\n\r\nI have been glued to this game, constantly wanting to play it more. Do give Hades a go!",

        "review": "Hades is Supergiant Games' breakout title released at a time when rogue-like was king, capitalising on Supergiant's unique hand-drawn aesthetic and refining their gameplay from Bastion while incorporating their visual novel storytelling from Pyre.\r\nIt's a decent enough game with a decent amount of variety to see through to the end of the \"main quest\" which means completing the 4 levels of Hades domain a dozen times or so until the plot has been drip fed enough so that you deserve to see the credits.\r\nAfter that there's an epilogue with some more story that if you really like the game and like doing the same thing over sand over you can play through to unlock various things and more drips of dialogue.\r\nPersonally, not my favourite game by the developers but its just mindless enough to hammer out a run now and again and chat to the hipster theme park versions of some Ancient Greek mythology figures.",

Then I finally understood how to defeat each Boss and started going on a win streak, eventually unlocking the true ending. Instantly purchased Hades 2 as a result. I am a fan.",

        "review": "If you like rogue-like games, you'll like this gem. Greek mythology, beautiful artstyle and fun story will make you want to spend hours playing the game. \r\nThe beginning can be tough, since you don't know what you're doing and some buffs are locked, but you'll keep trying to get farther away anyway, be it because you want to enjoy the rest of the story or because you enjoy seeing your skills improve. You'll learn the patterns of various enemies and improve your dodging fast, you'll try different blessings and their combinations, and if you're worried the runs will be too similiar still, you have six different weapons to choose from that change the playstyle a lot. You're encouraged to try them all and not get tied to only one of them. You'll probably die a lot, sometimes after quite an adrenaline rush, but chilling in the House of Hades makes it less of a pain and disappointment because there, you get to interact with its residents, give them gifts, learn more about them (and the protagonist). YOU CAN PET CERBERUS, THE BEST BOY IN THE UNDERWORLD.\r\nThere's one thing that I disliked, which is fishing. It's nice and all until you find out there's something called \"perfect catch\", and then how to achieve that... I got a legendary fish only once before I gave up and installed a mod to make it less unachievable and unforgiving (and to finish all the fish entries in the Codex). Other than that, I enjoyed pretty much everything during these two weeks of playing and trying to complete everything.\r\nMy last goal is to finish a run with 36 heat. If you know, you know.\r\n\r\nTl;dr: Fun and rewarding game; fishing sucks; your keyboard, mouse and hands will hate you for playing it too much",

One of the most accessible yet challenging roguelites out there.\r\n\r\nThe game takes a lot of time to beat but every run is rewarding and makes you stronger to the point you'll blast through the whole game and beat the final boss like it's an easy task.\r\nIt just demands patience and perserverance. \r\n\r\nThis game is best enjoyed in short bursts (3-4 runs each session). There were times when I felt burned out and bored and it's okay. I stopped playing for a few days then I came back excited to continue my escape attempt. It's a well crafted experience that will always fun to play.\r\n\r\nHades is a game that grows on you and that you'll enjoy to last minute and even after you finish, you'll still feel the temptation to do more runs and grow even stronger.\r\n\r\nAmazing game!",

        "review": "TLDR: The game is too hard and lacking in roguelike randomness to make up for the mythological pastiche story.\n\nThe upgrading system is broken both for the character itself and for the weapons. This means that completing runs has more to do with skill level than the boons you get or how you have tried to maximinize stats and weapons. If you aren't very skillful, you won't complete a single run, you'll get frustrated prior.\n\nI understand that prima facie it seems pathetic to say I dont want skill level to be the primary deciding factor for a game, but for me a good roguelike game is one where the unskilled player can also win by either being fortunate or being strategic in how they spend their resources.\n\nLuck and randomness are a hugely important ingredient for the kind of fun roguelikes can provide. The most notorious example of a well executed one to me is The Binding of Isaac, that I have completed and enjoyed because even though my skill level is low (and remains low) I have a chance to feel competent and flowy with my gameplay thanks to good luck and wise choices of items. And there's just that lottery winning sensation too when you ride a string of obtaining powerful and symbiotic skills/items.\n\nThat is not really present of influential in Hades and for that I consider it a frustrating game.\n\nFinally the story is skippable and \"non-canonical\" mythology wise, I'd rather read Aeschylus' tragedies, which I did recently.",

        "review": "Hades is an exceptional game that brilliantly blends engaging storytelling, fast-paced gameplay, and stunning visual design. Here's a closer look at what makes this game a must-play:\r\n\r\nStoryline:  \r\nAt its core, Hades offers a meaningful and emotionally rich narrative. You play as Zagreus, the rebellious son of Hades, who is determined to escape the Underworld and discover the truth about his origins. The story is steeped in Greek mythology, but it‚Äôs the game‚Äôs unique take on these ancient tales that stands out. Each attempt to escape is more than just a gameplay loop; it‚Äôs an opportunity to dive deeper into the complex relationships and secrets of the Olympian gods. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and often humorous, making each interaction a joy.\r\n\r\nGameplay:  \r\nThe combat in *Hades* is nothing short of exhilarating. With tight, responsive controls and a variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal, every run feels fresh and challenging. The game‚Äôs roguelike structure means that each death is not the end, but rather a chance to grow stronger and learn more. The progression system is well-balanced, ensuring that even after countless attempts, the gameplay remains satisfying. Whether you‚Äôre dodging enemy attacks, chaining combos, or unleashing devastating godly powers, the action is always fluid and addictive.\r\n\r\nGraphics: \r\nVisually, Hades is a masterpiece. The art style is vibrant and richly detailed, with each environment in the Underworld being distinct and visually striking. The character designs are equally impressive, with the gods and other figures from Greek mythology rendered in a style that is both modern and true to their mythic roots. The use of color is particularly noteworthy, with the game‚Äôs palette bringing the world of the Underworld to life in a way that‚Äôs both dark and beautiful.\r\n.",

The hack and slash, roguelike gameplay is also really nice, and you can't really get away with dashing mindlessly because of the traps and attack patterns of enemies. \r\n\r\n9/10",

I really like how after 100 times you never feel like you are stuck doing the same things because there is always new lines of dialogue, new stuff to unlock and new powers to try and combine. The art of the game is also really cool, if fits perfectly the themes and the ambients of the game, and also teaches you a couple facts about greek mithology (though you may want to check the internet to see how accurate it is).\nI played it all on the steam deck and it seems like the natural way of playing it, runs and looks amazing.",

        "review": "While the game is creatively executed and balanced (I suppose), the controls feel very very rigid. I would like to emphasize this for all those who consider a purchase, you need a controller. You can play without it but it's torture and I highly advise not doing it unless you have a controller or plan to get one. I tried it on my computer with a k+m and got frustrated very very fast. Another huge issue is that soon enough it just becomes a repetetive bore that you can't keep up for long before you just decide it isn't worth the time. I thought that it would be more akin to Jupiter Hell where the levels are big enough to allow exploration. This just feels like a huge chore that leaves you jaded and frustrated to get through. It feels like you downloaded a really limited demo of a hack n slash game and keep waiting to progress further. Overall if you like bitesized levels with very predictable enemies, go for this I suppose. But I'd much rather recommend Death Must Die.",

        "review": "What can be said of Hades that hasn't already been stated numerous times before?\r\n\r\nIf you are at all familiar with rogue-like games, then you know exactly what you're in for. The aspect of Hades that helps it stand apart from other rogue-like dungeon crawlers is the amazing story, brilliantly based in Greek Myth, that unfolds as you repeatedly attempt to complete each run. What's more is that the game doesn't even begin, in earnest, until you have successfully finished your first run (usually after many, many attempts.)\r\n\r\nAfterward, the scope of the game really opens up to the players and we get to see just how well-made and massive this game is. The amount of content embedded in the game is amazing and will have you coming back time and time again to check another box off, challenge yourself, or to simply have a blast. \r\n\r\nI agree with the players who liken this game to a highly addictive drug. This is all thanks to the intricate, woven tapestry of story (told through incredible voice acting), rogue-mechanics (you simply cannot  beat this game without putting in time and effort), enjoyment (amazing game-play and intuitive design), and wonderful aesthetics (character / world design and artwork.)\r\n\r\nI cannot recommend this game enough.\r\n\r\nOh, and Hades is still well-worth playing in 2024, by the way!",

        "review": "The fourth masterpiece in a row from a studio that seems to not know how to make a mistake. This one is a roguelite set in the Underworld, Hades, and has you assume the role of Hades' rather wilful son Zagreus who has set his mind on escaping to the surface. He has allies both above and below, as he is aided by his adoptive mother Nyx, as well as a complement of Olympian gods. Primordial Chaos lends a hand here and there as well.\nVisually, Hades is what I've come to expect from Supergiant: vibrant, gaudy colours, a stubbornly specific style, and lots of contrast. The sound design is cool as well, the music is superb.\nSince Hades is a roguelite, it expects you to navigate its environs with the utmost precision and power. It happily provides you a bunch of tools to do this very thing. You have 8 weapons at your disposal, different aspects of each can be unlocked a bit later into the game. The hidden aspects are fun callouts of different mythologies. The abovementioned Olympians grant you boons as you go through levels, each of which functions as an upgrade in the spirit of its giver. The boons are almost entirely random, meaning that you will go through quite a few runs before coming across a playstyle you've experienced before. This, and a bunch of mechanics meant to provide further difficulty give Hades a very high replayability value (within one save game, if that makes sense).\nThe only problem I have with it is that it asks too much - it is too difficult for me. Thankfully, the developers have included the aptly named God Mode which provides the player with damage resistance which increases with deaths.\nTLDR awesome game, as usual. Get it.",

There is actually no need to optimise the game, or better said there is no need to minmax unless you would like to try a broken build, I have a couple of play throughs on it you can expect about 20-30 hours on your first play through (thats just for the story part of the game later on game is still replayable).",

        "review": " A Masterpiece of Roguelike Design\n\nHades is nothing short of phenomenal. From its gripping narrative to its meticulously crafted gameplay, this game has it all. The blend of fast-paced combat, strategic depth, and rich storytelling creates an experience that‚Äôs both addictive and rewarding.\n\nPros:\n\nEngaging Combat: The combat is fluid and satisfying, with a wide variety of weapons and abilities that keep each run fresh and exciting. The skill ceiling is high, but the game offers plenty of tools and upgrades to help you improve.\n\nFantastic Art and Music: The visual style is stunning, with vibrant, detailed environments and character designs. The soundtrack is equally impressive, perfectly complementing the action and mood.\n\nDeep Storytelling: The narrative is woven into the gameplay seamlessly. The characters are well-developed, and their interactions are both entertaining and meaningful. It‚Äôs rare to see a roguelike that invests so much in its story, and Hades excels in this regard.\n\nReplayability: Each run feels different thanks to the diverse range of upgrades and choices. The game‚Äôs progression system keeps you coming back for more, with plenty of unlocks and secrets to discover.\n\nQuality of Life: The game offers a range of accessibility options and thoughtful design choices that make the experience smooth and enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n\nChallenging for Some: The difficulty can be quite steep, especially for those new to roguelikes. However, the game‚Äôs gradual learning curve and abundant resources help mitigate this.\nOverall, Hades is a triumph in game design. It manages to combine intense gameplay with a rich narrative, making every escape attempt feel meaningful. Whether you‚Äôre a roguelike veteran or a newcomer, this game is an absolute must-play. Highly recommended!",

        "review": "Despite the unanimous praise for this game and all those unexpected wins in the 2020 game awards, I didn't play Hades until this year. It wasn't the type of game I had tried before, nevertheless it was on my radar.\n\nCharacter design + choice of colours was right up my alley.\n\nThe characters are all loveable. Especially, Thanatos. If I had a nickel for every time I crushed on Thanatos in any piece of media, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.\n\nDialogues were enjoyable, some were witty, some were heartfelt; The whole dialogue system made it feel like a lot of care had been put into planning it. Always looked forward to what each character would say after doing a specific thing.\n\nThe soundtrack was great, the vibes were immaculate.\n\nSince it's a roguelite game, there's a lot of grinding to do. The last time I grinded this much in a videogame was back when I played Yakuza 0. So unless you are used to roguelite games and don't mind grinding to progress in the story and character relationships, it might not be your cup of tea.\n\nOverall, a great game",

I don't know exactly how they did it but I'm getting more and more okay with dieing and starting from scratch. Maybe cause I keep getting better at killing the enemies I've passed so it's not so tedious and it's actually feels more rewarding, as I can clearly see the improvement of my skills. It doesn't hurt that I do actually level up in some ways, so that makes things easier too.",

        "review": "I am impressed. I don't have a huge amount of fanaticism for 3rdP action games and liked Bastion alright but that was it. \n\nHades is next level. It's got that Binding of Isaac gameflow but with a super tight, well balanced action combat that feels like how I hear people hype up Devil May Cry, but with a perspective that actually makes it possible to see what's going on. I don't exactly know what it was, I'm sure it was many small things, but they have absolutely NAILED the gamefeel in this game. I'm very excited to pick up the currently EA sequal now just to see more weapons, more enemy types, new boons and such. Some how the engine they've made here makes essentially any variation feel extremely nice so my only critique is... gimme more!\n\nThe game itself is good, but the narrative choices are superb including next level character designs of tried and true god characters seen in a new, but still extremely accurate, light. I suspected that they were going to over-modernize the characters, and have writing like something along the lines of Night in the Woods where it sounds like you're reading some college student's twitter feed, but it's not like that at ALL. This is now one of my big inspirations for character writing. They all have super unique voices and their motivations are made totally obvious, all without even a directly linear plot. The devs have made an amazing system where you get relevant dialogue based on your recent in-game actions from a myriad of characters, and I struggle to think of a game that pulled off a more organic, non-linear storytelling technique that's this effective because of it. \n\nI am blown away, and made all the better by it's excellent Steam Deck performance, including good battery usage and clear sound mixing for smaller speakers, which you don't always find with a kick-ass game. \n\nSTRONG recommend!\n\nPS: Bacchus if you see this, please respond to my friend request. I still wanna hang out, man.",
