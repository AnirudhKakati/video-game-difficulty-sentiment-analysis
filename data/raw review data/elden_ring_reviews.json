Its open-world design offers unmatched freedom to explore breathtaking landscapes, filled with hidden secrets and lore. The storytelling is deep and subtle, unraveling through the environment, NPCs, and cryptic item descriptions, creating a rich, never-ending narrative.\n\nHowever, what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its relentless difficulty. Like other FromSoftware titles, it challenges players with tough enemies and complex combat, demanding precision and patience. Each victory feels earned, adding to the addictive thrill. In summary, Elden Ring is a captivating blend of freedom, challenge, and deep storytelling.",

The vast, beautifully designed world is a joy to explore, filled with secrets, intense combat, and challenging boss battles that kept me hooked for hours.\n\nThat said, a few of the bosses, like the fat and skinny brothers, felt a bit repetitive, which slightly detracted from the overall experience. However, this minor gripe doesn’t take away from how incredible the game is as a whole. The variety of environments, deep lore, and satisfying combat mechanics make it one of the best open-world games I’ve ever played.\n\nDespite some boss repetition, Elden Ring remains an all-around amazing game. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a rich, challenging, and immersive adventure!",

Surprisingly few bugs for a game this massive.\r\nMEH: Some weird mechanics make it more frustrating than it needs to be. lots of things are not intuitive. \r\nBAD: A triple A title that does not support widescreen or over 60 FPS. This ruins it for me. Playing on a chopped down screen at 1/4 FPS is beyond annoying. \r\n\r\nYes I know their is third party software to address this. It is very janky to have to modify files and load a third party app to get decent performance out of a major title. Also it disables some major game features.\r\n",

        "review": "A fantastic and accessible soulslike that both breathes new life into the genre while keeping the familiar tone that fans have come to love. Elden Ring is a world brimming with secrets and challenges on a grand scale that would seem impossible for a souls game but the creators of the genre have shown just how versatile that genre can be. With the introduction of Shadow of the Erd Tree we're treated to what is essentially a full game in under the guise of simple DLC. Fromsoftware even envisioned a way to challenge players who have over leveled by requiring fragments as a means to increase power as opposed to relying solely on leveling. An ingenious approach to a level 500 player walking in and steamrolling everything. Elden Ring and the DLC are game-changers and worthy of the GOTY title.",

        "review": "So after completing the game more than 4 times on Steam and 2 times in seamless coop, I can confidently say this is the best open-world RPG ever made. For me, it was The Witcher 3 holding the title for years, but now we have a new Elden Lord to claim the crown, haha.\n\nThe lore in Elden Ring is something else. From the mind of R.R. Martin and direction from Miyazaki, this is not just lore but an experience of its own. From cool to mysterious to dark, every backstory of particular NPCs or bosses is different, making you want to explore more. Since I've completed the game with 100% side quests and main story guidance, it’s pretty easy to get lost in the woods or ruins if you don’t have guidance to chase the lore.\n\nThe DLC for Elden Ring is a game-changer. After diving into it, I can say it adds so much to the experience. The new areas are breathtaking, just like the main game, and the fresh challenges and bosses are a blast. The lore gets even richer, pulling you deeper into the world with new stories that make you want to explore every corner. Completing the new quests felt rewarding, like a sweet bonus for all the time I’ve spent in the Lands Between. If you loved the base game, this DLC is an absolute must-play!\n\nApart from the lore, the combat is challenging yet fun to mess around with, xD. It’s a typical Souls-like game, but here you get a vast open world to explore for new weapons, magic spells, incantations, and many more things to kill the dead. On top of that, every weapon or spell has its own visuals or ambient effects, which look stunning on high graphics—just like a visual novel or something. The graphics are breathtaking; the world is beautifully made and designed. From Limgrave to the nightmare called Caelid, haha, every area feels creepy yet beautiful.\n\nIn short, I’d say Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that Miyazaki-sama has done for us. Ngl, even if you’re weak or a pussy, you need to play Elden Ring once in your lifetime. Just like RDR 2, Wukong, The Witcher, and many more, it’s rare to find such a masterpiece these days that respects your time and money invested in games.\n\n10/10 – A fucking masterpiece. Miyazaki GOAT.\n",

The base game feels nice and fair with a good amount of difficulty. Every boss is unique and all remembrance bosses are a good test of skill. The DLC however isnt't as good. It feels unpolished and incomplete. Most bosses are fine but nothing special, Prmised consort Radahn and Mesmer are nice but apart from those it feels a bit clunky. Especially Bayle with the horrendous lock on and commander Gaius which is an unfair fight in general. Lots of areas are hidden behind paths one isn't able to easily find. Elden ring 8/10, Shadow of the Erdtree 6/10.",

        "review": "Elden Ring is one of the most immersive and literally \"Open World\" RPG's that has ever been released. It has its difficulties in the sense that you really do sort of wander around and stumble into quests which have little to no guidance. However, this gives the game the feel of truly being a unique experience to an individual player. The difficulty, while difficult at first, by the end for the most part is easily manageable. The graphics, for being a two-year-old game, are still breath taking and the cut scenes still mesmerize you. I spent a lot of time over exploring and taking my time completing the quests which I feel allowed me to truly take in all the game has to offer. Amazing game play, intricate story, lots of character customization, and lots of replay. Highly recommend for any RPG fan. Would also recommend checking out some walkthroughs since the stories and missions can be a little difficult to discern. I used FightinCowboy on YouTube for my guide. \n\nAgain, I cannot stress enough how amazing of a game this is.",

I can tell everyone that this game is very punishing and torturous but also satisfying when you the bosses. No wonder this game got the game of the year award considering how massively beautiful this game was made. Environment, combat, character development artwork of this game is fabulous. It is so massive that you will find something to do and not sit idle. If you guys are gamers and like to challenge yourselves, then this game is made for you.",

        "review": "I have played this game three times on PlayStation 5 and purchased it on Steam to enjoy it even more. This is the best game I have ever played. The Lands Between is the most beautiful game world I have ever experienced. The quality of detail put into not just the playable world, but also the overarching concept, is incredible. It's all too easy to lose yourself in this game.\n\nAs with most FromSoftware titles, you may need to read between the lines to grasp some story elements, but I believe a deeper understanding isn't necessary for full enjoyment. The game's themes are strong enough on their own to convey their intended impact, regardless of your familiarity with the lore.\n\nCharacter creation follows the typical FromSoftware formula with a few improvements, but overall, it hasn't changed significantly. Weapons, weapon arts, and magic have all seen enhancements and expansions, making me excited to see how these systems could evolve in future FromSoftware games. Casting and executing most abilities in Elden Ring feels satisfying and impactful.\n\nOne of the standout features, aside from the beautifully crafted world, is the build diversity. You can approach the game in various ways, with minimal restrictions. Want to play as a classic knight? Go for it. Prefer a magic caster? Absolutely. Holy builds are also viable. This game offers full expression of playstyle.\n\nThat said, nothing is handed to you. You must grow your strength by overcoming some of the most terrifying boss designs that FromSoftware has ever created, while also experiencing the evolution of their design philosophy—teaching through experience. Patience is key. This game is challenging, but it is not unfair. You are battling gods and monsters of incomprehensible scale, and that feeling permeates the entire experience.\n\nThis is not a game. This is an experience. ❤️",

        "review": "I have played the first dark souls through a number of times, and ds3 is one of the games that impacted me the most as a gamer.  I did not enjoy a fair amount of my time in Elden Ring.  The game is about 15% too big, and maybe 20% too long.  They added some marvelous QOL things that the previous souls games DESPERATELY needed.  Fast travel from anywhere: GOATED.  Not consuming gems for infusions: GOATED.  There's a myriad of other things that really stepped up the monotony of the souls games, but the core mechanics, the combat, rolling, and even some button controls, hugely frustrating.  \n\nConstantly running these supremely long distances dodging trash mobs and mobs designed with the soul intention of sweeping your legs from under you and stalling progress is enormously frustrating.  Sniper lobsters, bow giants, rune bears to name a few, existing in spaces in order to make you walk around or get into a needlessly difficult fight.  \n\nLudicrously convoluted progress.  I know that we are sort of playing off the dark souls semi metroidvania style of quest progression and \"go here, go back, thennnn you can move forward\" style of gameplay, but with a game this large I just feel like my time is being wasted.  \n\nBosses are so COMPLEX, not necessarily hard.  Any given boss, be it a dungeon boss or a main story boss, has 30 moves, endless aggression, gap closers, modular combos, and wild animations that make the famously bad dark souls camera, show even more.  Boss fights feel suffocating and unrewarding to learn, because once you master x, you get x + n, and n could be anywhere from 3 to 10 other things.  Learning a boss has always been the true experience in souls games, but when mistakes are SO punishing with large staggers and long followup combos, you can't simply drink, and then try and get your head back on.  you die, and you walk back, and you start over.  \n\nIn the same sense, you are not Sekiro, with a large assortments of moves available and equipment which can entirely change your strategy, and can be swapped to at essentially no charge.  If a strategy isn't working in ER (or any souls game) you now get to go out and acquire an entirely new weapon somehow, level it up, and possibly spend a larval tear to respec your stats, find new spells, maybe new armor.  it's one thing for a smaller scale game, but when you maybe need to do it multiple times i just find it tedious.  Take the crystillians, you are almost guaranteed to swap to a weapon that you're not using in general.  \n\nBoss fight pacing is also really bad, some boss will put in a 10 hit combo and you can get one poke in before it starts all over again.  You can tell from the nerfs for SOTE that the creators have thought this way too.  \n\nIf i was single, and childless, and had 6 hours to play games a day again like I did when i was younger, i might enjoy this game more, but I got through 1 playthrough and started several others that I just end up abandoning because it's just TOO MUCH FRUSTRATION.",

        "review": "Elden Ring isn’t just a game. Oh no. It’s an experience—a soul-crushing, beautifully punishing experience. I’ve sunk over 100 hours into it, and I’ve come to a few conclusions.\n\nFirst off, the world? Absolutely gorgeous. You know, if you’re into places that are literally falling apart at the seams, full of death, decay, and creatures trying to kill you at every turn. Lovely stuff.\n\nThe voice acting? Incredible. Each NPC sounds like they’ve accepted their inevitable doom, which, honestly, is the kind of energy I’ve come to expect in this place.\n\nAnd the story? Completely unique. I mean, I think I understand about 12% of what’s going on, but that’s part of the charm, right?\n\nNPCs? Flawless. You’ve never met a more perfect collection of emotionally broken, cryptic weirdos. The ones that don’t try to murder you, anyway.\n\nThe map is massive. You can wander for hours and always find something new to ruin your day. What a treat. Oh, I died again.\n\nThe boss fights? Just breathtaking. Beautiful, terrifying, and designed to make you question why you keep coming back. Every single one has a story that’s equal parts tragic and horrifying. Truly a highlight.\n\nAnd bugs? Nope, none at all. Perfectly smooth gameplay at all times. Okay, maybe it depends on your rig. I’ve had a few glitches, but nothing major. Moving along.\n\nThe graphics? Absolutely atrocious. I’ve never seen anything so stunningly terrible in my life. It’s so bad it looks amazing. Now I’m reviewing in opposites. Up is down, down is up. What is this game doing to me?\n\nAnd of course, the difficulty. Completely soul-like, which is just a fancy way of saying “this game will destroy you, and you’ll thank it for the opportunity.” That’s what makes Elden Ring so special. \n\nTLDR; Worth buying and sinking hundreds of hours into.",

It does not respect your time in a way that is fun. \n\nFor context I was 50 hours into a new play through having a great time with my magic build (which I recommend to all beginners) when I handed in one quest out of order killing an NPC from another quest that I wasn't done with ending that second quest early and permanently locking me out of the quest reward I would have otherwise gotten. Now my only option to get the items I missed was to either \n\noption A. push through to the end of the game and pick it up on new game plus or \noption B. completely restart the game on a new file. \nI chose option C and simply put down the game. After all, if this game isn't going to respect my time I'm not going to spend my time on this game.",

Let me start with the cons that outweigh the pros: the open world feels empty, and it copies mobs from Dark Souls, even though this is a new universe and game. It's very difficult to follow the path planned by the developers because if you find the boss later, you'll be too strong for him and will kill him on the first try. An open world is not suitable for this genre. The quests, as always in the games from this studio, are rubbish. In Dark Souls, they could be completed intuitively, but here, maybe 0.1% of players will finish them without guides. You practically need to get into Miyazaki's head to figure out where the quest character is standing this time.\n\nThere are few good bosses  8 come to mind, and it's even funny to call the rest \"bosses.\" There's a lack of a coherent local plot, and instead, we get more vague, global nonsense about gods and aliens.\n\nNow for the advantages of the game: the beautiful locations, a sea of interesting weapons and spells, and the 8 good bosses. I especially liked the capital, though sadly, it was the only location that truly impressed me.",

But if you like grinding your life away hours to barely progress and you enjoy a challenge thats near impossible unless you helplessly devote your blood, sweat and tears, this game is for you my friend. After 20 hours, i've felt nothing but frustration playing this game. The unforgiving fall mechanics with the unpredictable horse movement is a great combination to ensure I dont even want to play anymore before I even arrive at a location. And then the extreme stunlock on players, unreciprocated to even the weakest mobs are in the game, strip the player of almost any chance to win any combat encounter unles  you avoid getting hit by an enemy a single time, at all. You must sweat your ass off, spamming dodge and praying the boss triggers the animation your looking for, so that you can get an opening of approximately 0.3 seconds to do 1.4% of the bosses total health. You must then repeat this cycle 80 more times all while not getting hit a single time because as I said, you will die even if youre hit once. But what if you build health and equip better armor? Even with vigor and protections built, you will be one-shotted so you might as well not build any vigor. As a matter of fact, you might as well not have any hope at all of success unless you are an absolute tryhard. I really tried to enjoy this game, yet every time I play Elden Ring, Im ready to close the game within the hour.",

The open world turned out to be a perfect fit for the genre and you can still tell this masterpiece was created by the famous Japanese studio. I honestly haven’t been so excited about a game since the first Dark Souls.",

The feeling you get after defeating that one boss you have been struggling with is amazing. After playing this, I don't see how I can go back to games like Dark Souls 3, as this improves on it in nearly every way. My only critique would be some of the boss' designs. Several of them are only difficult due to dumb parts of their fights, Malenia with the life steal, Mohg with the second phase arena, and Rykard with the nearly impossible to dodge attacks. Other than those, I don't really have any criticisms of this game.",

I ended up using skills and gear that were recommended from videos, though. If I were to play New Game+  I think I wouldn't take it so seriously and play with Goldmask's gear the whole time. Overall definitely worth playing! Got nearly 150 hours out of me and I am sure there are things I missed. If you are just starting out or are interested in getting the game I would suggest following a guide loosely. There were MANY times that I missed important gear or NPC's or even whole areas that I didn't know about until using the Wiki. Enjoy!",

And not to mention the boss fights are awesome and each dodge is earned.\n\nThe story is complicated but it is so good and I love the little details they put into this game and I am reading every new Item I get so i can get the lore that is in the land between. And its still confusing but that's the awesome part its confusing enough to want to replay to gain the knowledge of the lore but also you know who this boss is but you may not know the moves and so you get to replay in a way that you will understand the story more and more each time you play.\n\nI've had 3 playthroughs and each I've had a Blast playing and I've been very much enjoying the DLC and it is so large, that I am still not finished with it even 2 months after release, And so I would like to say thank you FromSoftware I really enjoy this game, and remember the first rule of Elden ring, Don't get grabbed!",

This game fixed my marriage, paid off my student loans, and made me more appealing to women. \n\nIn all seriousness, I feel it nearly incontrovertible that this is the greatest game of all time, and I have a hard time imagining that anything in the near future could possibly change that. This was my first soulslike game. I have played ~120 hours on steam and another 200 hours on console. I have done nearly everything there is to do in both the main game and the DLC. This is just chef's kiss. My single favorite piece of art and the best game ever. I'm really glad that I played it. Give it a shot; it's not that hard!",

        "review": "\"If you're planning to buy Elden Ring with the intention of playing co-op with your friends, it's important to know that the co-op system feels unnecessarily complicated and clunky. Unlike modern games with seamless multiplayer, Elden Ring isn't, they relies on summoning items (which are relatively easy to obtain), moreover the co-op session will ends once you defeat a boss or enter a new region. You can't freely team up with friends to explore the open world together, which can be disappointing for those expecting a more fluid co-op experience (such as me).\n\nAdditionally, the invasion system, in my opinion, could use some improvement. I encounter alot of players who wants to bait you into fighting near large groups of enemies, dragging out the encounter or forcing you into unfavorable situations. A time limit for invaders might help, ensuring they engage more directly instead of retreating to find additional mobs, there was one session where we would do this over and over for about 20 minutes, and then he would just leave, tired of waiting for us to follow him. Where we could've just explore more of the area or catacombs. I mean as an invader, you should expect to face at least a 2v1 scenario, and if you're seeking a more balanced fight, the dedicated PvP options like the Colosseum is a choice.\n\nOverall, while Elden Ring gives you a great single-player experience.",

The lowest entry barrier for a fromsoftware, but with a good and steeply rising learning curve.\nPerfect worldbuilding, an open world in which something is hidden everywhere and you are rewarded everywhere in a pleasant and non-intrusive way. The world is incredibly varied and has a different structure. Of course, there are no quest markers, directional arrows or anything else, here you decide for yourself in which direction you want to explore.\nPerfected battle system à la Dark Souls, but much, much faster. Enemies and bosses are superbly designed. Personally, I find the recycling of the bosses with the incredibly high number of them only logical and not bad at all, but some people probably see it differently. \nThe only drawback for me is that at a certain point it feels a little dragging as soon as you enter the ‘snow area’, without wanting to spoil anything. The quality doesn't or hardly decreases as a result, but after so much fighting, exploring and travelling, you're simply exhausted.\nAn incredible number of weapons, weapon skills, spells, incantations, tools, summons and much more, so that you can try out an infinite number of builds and the replay value is therefore immensely high. You can also redistribute your stat points a good number of times within a game run.\nI don't play PvP myself, so unfortunately I can't comment on this.\nAn 11/11 game and definitely in the top 5 of the best games of the past decade.",

She is totally more agressive now, all attacks are the same but she does the shittiest of them much more often. Chilling intervals are now rare. She is now like beating Isshin w/o option to parry.

I really tried to like it because I spent a lot of money on it expecting it to be very well made, however it was very poorly put together in many ways and its setup actually looked very outdated and not user friendly. The combat was very average and the plot isn't very straightforward. It seems pretty pointless to have so many \"bosses\" roaming around very close to each other and nothing was really explained about the plot. The whole game in itself feels not very fun to play and I made it up to a point where I'm assuming the game glitched, because no matter where I went I couldn't get out of where I was. Overall the whole experience was very poor and it felt more annoying than enjoyable to play.",

The world-building, environment, and exploration are expertly crafted; every little detail in this game mattered. You see a distant castle and think, \"I want to go there?\" The answer is a yes!\r\n\r\nEvery optional boss encounter was so enjoyable that I found myself immersed for 60 hours before returning to the main storyline. The areas you explore are truly rewarding.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight is your mount, which encourages you to revisit this world whenever you want. Unlike other Souls like games, where taking a break can make it tough to return, this game is designed to be more inviting and accessible. Plus, the addition of a map and waypoints makes it easy to navigate and explore at your leisure.\r\n____\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n- too many to mention\r\n- The designs of the DLC bosses are outstanding, they are very unique\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n- The music isn’t as memorable as that of other Souls games\r\n- The dungeon designs feel repetitive and lack creativity\r\n- The spell designs are mediocre, while the incantations are more creative and visually appealing\r\n- Many bosses has similar patterns in the base game\r\n- The DLC lacks achievements, which made me return to it less frequently than the base game after completing it\r\n\r\nELDEN RING: Game of the Decade/10\r\nDLC 9/10\r\n",

Somewhat agree... story for another day).\r\n\r\nI stayed away from \"souls-like\" games as they were touted as difficult, too hard, time consuming, etc. THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.\r\n\r\nThe story-lines, complete attention to detail with all terrain (even down to the fingerprints on the huge fingers in the DLC?!), could not be more impressed. This game is worth much more than $60 and I'm thrilled I finally decided to play it.\r\n\r\nOnly caveat - the ending to the DLC is a bit meh.... but that's my only minor complaint.",

        "review": "I am not a fan of Dark Souls. I tried that game and stopped after only an hour, because I simply didn't find it engaging. Same goes for Sekiro, and I thought this would be the same. But after my friends had been constantly telling me to play this I decided to finally try it out a few months ago. \n\nRight from the opening, overlooking Stormveil Castle, I couldn't wait to explore more. Then came the beautiful view of Limgrave and all the secrets and places to explore there. The game just kept making my jaw drop to the floor with the beautiful environment design, insane creativity of Boss fights over and over and over again. I did use mods to increase draw distance and remove the 60fps cap, which I would recommend to others as well. Improved my experience a lot.\n\nThe game definitely has some weakpoints, and I would recommend freely using the wiki to look up Boss weaknesses, how a mechanic works, or where to next find an NPC in their questline, since otherwise you might miss out on completing it. \n\nOverall though, after 120 hours and all Achievements, I'm very glad I spent the money, time and occasionally sanity to complete this. Absolute art.",

Amazing game with beautiful world to explore. The only con is that the game only reaches it's highest potential for new players to the genere after a couple of dozens of hours.

This is a 100% a game of the year and what every other company should strive for in terms of heart, promises, and the engagement with the fans. This will hopefully not be the last souls game released!",

Elden ring is not just game it’s an experience similar to the DS trilogy and Bloodborne. This entry of the souls series is one of the more easier ones since it’s open world but overall whenever I boot up the game I never get bored plus the online pvp is fun with everyone’s unique builds but obviously some things can be broken for a certain amount of time before it gets patched. Everyone should at least try this game if you’re new to souls games or trying to get into the series.",

Depending on the build you run does change how \"easy\" or \"hard\" the game is, but no matter how you play, it's fun. If you want to play with friends without being invaded I'd suggest downloading the Seamless Coop mod where you can disable invasions. There's plenty of stuff to do in game, between online invasions or fight clubs, speedruns and challenge runs, or just playing through the game on the same character over and over again (my main character on PS5 is on NG8 I think.) And I mean, if you like lore (like I do) it's got a lot of lore to look at or watch. Rule of advice, don't worry about whether or not your using \"meta\" builds or summons. Play the game how you want to play it and you'll have both a blast and a heart wrenching run back to your few hundred thousand runes before getting sniped again by a friggin lobster. Easy 10/10 IMO and worth every penny. The DLC is a lot of fun and introduces A LOT of new weapons, talismans, armor sets, ashes of war and the like. Have fun with the new Winter Lanters!",

This was my first Souls-like game, and I haven't played a different genre since. There are so many differences between how people experience the game, which makes talking about it with others great. The game offers so much to deal with whatever situation you are in, there are multiple paths to most areas you can stumble across and the combat is smooth and rewarding.\r\n\r\nFromsoft respects your time, and unlike older Souls games, most bosses don't have runbacks (Renalla still does). The only other negative thing in a sea of amazing is that, it is relatively hard to keep track of quests sometimes.\r\n\r\nYou feel fully immersed in a painting-like world, with an interesting story, satisfying gameplay and amazing world-building. I would recommend this game to anyone.",

        "review": "Having played over 1500 hours of this game, a few things I love:\r\n\r\nBuild variety is enormous, there truly is a build for everything out there. Yes, the game can be punishing at times, but not unreasonably so once you catch on to the logic of the encounters - I've had friends joke that Elden Ring is a rhythm game, but there is truth to that statement frankly, because a lot of the game is learning rhythms of enemy attacks and timing it right. Miyazaki himself also plays this game with summons and spirit ashes, according to interviews, so don't feel bad for summoning! \r\n\r\nMultiplayer is honestly quite fun. There is no voice chat, which is a boon for those of us with poorer experiences on vc - a lot of the interactions are through gestures and weapon wiggling. Invaders imo are really fun to play with - I usually bow when I see one (I would say at least 50% of my playtime is helping people through bosses) because I find that half the time, they'll bow back and be game for dueling. And if they don't and teabag after deleting you with their bullgoat armor + white face mask + bleed weapons, don't take it personally - this game tends to bring out a lot of passionate play! PvP is very useful in teaching skills for PvE imo, even if it is very intimidating at first, and once you get used to the gameplay it's a very fun challenge. Also don't be surprised if a host dies very quickly - that's sort of the way this game goes sometimes, and the deaths in this game veer on slapstick levels of funny (also once you play enough, you too will fall prey to the ridiculously dumb death!). Panic is always your enemy in this game - as well as gravity deaths. \r\n\r\nThe lore is absolutely bonkers, and mostly told via item descriptions - this is a great game for lore hunters out there, doubly so if you have an interest in things such as the occult (especially alchemy), the history of religions like Christianity, ancient societies, and the way FromSoftware makes the metaphor literal in the worldbuilding. There's a lot of really good architecture too, funnily enough, that lends itself to some fun for the archaeologically inclined!\r\n\r\nI love this game, and it for sure is a special interest of mine. It's absolutely huge, there's endless replayability, and a robust multiplayer base. The Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is also a must, there's some absolutely sick af weapons and bosses and it's basically a mini sequel to the base game. Don't get too caught up in the sweaty gamer salt, and you'll have a blast!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Whether you wanna go full melee with a giant sword or cast spells from a mile away, the variety of builds is chef's kiss. Every playstyle feels super satisfying, and no two fights are the same.\n\nThe world? Massive and packed with so many secrets, I can’t even. Every corner hides something cool or terrifying. The level design is straight-up genius. You’ll wander into a cave (or a hole in this case), think it’s just a quick detour, and end up into what feels like a whole other freakin’ dimension.\n\nNow, the boss fights… holy crap. Each one is a heart-pounding epic moment, and when you finally beat one, you feel like an absolute god. The difficulty is tough but totally fair, so when you win, it’s because you earned it.\n\nThe story? It’s there if you want it, but the world just speaks to you through the design and the NPCs. So much lore to uncover, and I couldn’t stop diving in. Plus, the graphics? Gorgeous. Every landscape, monster, and castle looks insane, and the atmosphere is just off the charts.\n\nAll in all, Elden Ring is straight fire. If you’re into epic battles, sick builds, and getting lost in a crazy huge world, this game is an absolute must-play.",

From the majestic, somber, to the comical. This game is putting me through every emotion in the book and has me reading on builds and lore like a dumdum.\n\nI'm not particularly good at souls-like but, for those who're intimidated, I'd say just take the dive. It'll be tough, but this difficulty is such a fundamental part of this greatness. Getting whopped so many times it becomes trivial, it allows you to focus on -learning- the stuff you need to go through.\n\nAnd then of course you get invaded by someone called BorgorKing98 that mollywops you into the dirt and that's also part of the majestic experience here fr.",

        "review": "As someone who has 100+ hours, all achievements, beaten all bosses and completed the game 5 total times, i would say that i have the experience to write a review about ELDEN RING. There will be no spoilers in this review. This review i will be long and in detail, so for those looking for a short review i can say that it is the best game i have ever played. Now, for the long one. I personally have never been a \"story game\" player, and i never really got into it. Then, my friend started to recommend me this game. At first i just thought it was another boring story game, but he kept saying i was missing out on the best game ever. On steam you can play a game for 3 hours before you can't refund it anymore so i thought i would just try it out and see what all the hype was about, after all i could just refund it if it was boring. The beginning of the game was very confusing for me, so i had to get help from a bunch of guides ( i didn't use guides for OP starter weapons tho). I was thinking about quitting and getting my refund a lot of times, but there was something pulling me towards it, i wanted to see where the story was going. So i didn't refund it and decided to play it fully through. I am so glad i did. This game was truly the one of the best gaming experiences i have ever had. The fact that there are so many silly little quest lines that are so easy to miss, but have so much meaning and are so well thought out is just incredible. The feeling when you beat the really hard bosses that you have been stuck on for so long. All the different builds and items to collect. The amazing, yet different endings. I can not recommend this game enough. This really gives the feeling of playing as the main character in a movie. I don't think we will have a game quite like this in a while. This game has changed the trajectory of my life. Thank you, ELDEN RING. \r\n\r\n- Some Random Guy On The Internet",

Still, I’d recommend Elden Ring to anyone who fancies themselves a good gamer who wants to get into souls games but think its too hard. [b]It's challenging but so worth it[/b].\n\nI first played it on a friend's system in 2022 and got absolutely hooked despite dying countless times. The story, characters, and the \"Lands Between\", everything is so immersive. This game even motivated me to get a job just so I could buy it myself. Worth every penny!",

        "review": "Shut the fuck up you maggot. You clearly don't understand what makes a great video game. Elden Ring is a beautifully crafted masterpiece with a rich-open, beautiful graphics, fantastical gameplay, a great narrative, great quest design and it gives a ton of freedom and an actual challenge. Meanwhile all the other games that came out this year are overrated, mediocre games with boring, generic and repetitive gameplay, boring and uninteresting narratives and keep telling you what to do every 5 seconds. You and the people that support these kinds of doghit games are everything that is wrong this the gaming industry. These companies give you garbage and you guys eat it up and ask for more. Elden Ring is literally the only game that deserves to be called a true video game. Everything else is a joke and a scam. So fuck you, fuck all the people that pay for it, and fuck these companies that keep pumping these shitty mediocre kiddy games. I hope all of you fuckers die. Elden Ring and FromSoftware deserve all the praise and much more. They are single-handedly carrying the entire gaming industry with their state of the art games.\n\n",

Just pure amazing quality in terms of the gameplay, awe-inspiring vistas, and environmental storytelling. There are definitely themes and story elements that are not for everyone. \r\n\r\nThe best thing about Elden Ring is how it onboards people who may have bounced off of Souls games in the past. Namely, me. I hadn't played any Souls games before, played this, and immediately wanted to check out Dark Souls and Bloodborne (please come to PC) because now I understood what I was doing. After playing this and 100% it, I understood the design mindset and wanted to explore the combat and stories that came before and it's been fantastic, where before it was just confusing and frustrating.",

If you can dream it, someone has probably done it, and so can you!

        "review": "Open-world Dark Souls as it is called is the game you'd like to play and return to over and over again, the game feels different though, and in a good way. The game offers a great challenge only if you refuse to use a lot of mechanics offered in-game (Ashen NPCs), magic, shields, status effects, and crafted items, that is you don't really need to research every aspect of the game to beat it but if you do the game rewards you. Bosses are interesting but some 7-8 hit combos make you want to get over with the boss. I haven't played the DLC yet but some of the bosses were quite annoying. I would definitely play it once more to try a different build, using magic, bleed/rot builds. The game offers thousands of hours of fun and that in itself deserves a 9.5/10",

From the character design, to the graphics, to the difficulty of the game, it was overall spectacular. I really enjoyed the uniqueness of each boss and having to learn each of their move sets. The only complaint I have about this game is that it feels too open world for me. What I mean by that is it's hard to know where you are supposed to go at times and if you are doing side quests, it is extremely easy to forget about them. I found that there were a lot of side quests that I would forget about and then not remember where to pick them back up. Outside of the lack of direction in the game, I'd still highly recommend this to anyone.",

To level defensive stats so you can take a few hits.  There is a learning curve and this game does not guide you very well. You will have to rely on reddit and the games wiki. But with a bit of work I am now absolutely hooked. The gameplay is great. Failure can at times be punishing, I recall yesterday when I lost about two hours worth of progress because instead of spending runes on leveling up I just kept questing and died, then I slipped and fell off of a cliff before I could go retrieve the loot off of my corpse. I play in offline mode, so I haven't gotten involved in PVP or Co-Op or anything yet. So consider this a preliminary review.",

However, due to the unreasonable interpretation of the competition rules by the organizers, he was forced to withdraw from the competition. This discriminatory behavior against Tekken players has caused widespread dissatisfaction. It is an insult to every Tekken player and fails to uphold the spirit of fair competition. It also poses potential unfairness and harm to the interests of players from various countries participating in Tekken sports events. Namco Bandai's loss of the spirit of Tekken competition and discrimination has led to a negative review for Tekken 8, ensuring that this shameful act by Namco Bandai and the organizers is remembered in history.\n\n2024年10月6日、タイのTWTで勝者組の16強に進出していた中国の鉄拳選手、陳陳XCCが、試合の理不尽な解釈により主催者側から棄権を強制されました。このような差別的な行為は、鉄拳選手ひとりひとりに対する侮辱であり、公平公正な競技精神を貫くことができず、鉄拳競技に参加する各国の選手ひとりひとりに対する不利益であるとの不満が広がっています。バンダイナムコゲームスは鉄拳の試合精神の喪失と差別を評価し、鉄拳8の不評を与え、バンダイナムコゲームスと主催者側の恥辱行為として歴史に刻まれました。",

This game pissed me off so much because I didn't understand that is was out the box a difficult game.\n\nI have since then completed 100% of the achievements and got through the DLC. The DLC is rough but if you you just want to progress and beat bosses with ease, there are options. Spirit summons, youtube cheese videos.\n\nI enjoy exploring. I love the graphics and sometimes I want the challenge of a boss. However I have completed the game made it enjoyable on my terms and don't care if I don't kill the boss without a summons. I don't get paid to play games, so I take advantage of everything I can find and do in the game to go from point A to B.\n\nI recommend the Base game and the DLC. I looked at the DLC as how can I defeat and cheese the new bosses. Not how do I learn the mechanics so people will know I am a good player. I just don't care, I want to beat the game start to finish. If I can do this and I am not a good player, then spend the money and beat it your way in anyway you see fit.",

You will have basically 0 chance of winning a fight based on reactionary skill alone bc in most cases their attacks are so strong and frequent that you wont survive more than 2 or 3 mistakes, die and restart the battle again... and again... and again... rinse and repeat until you finally win. Its unforgiving, unreasonably hard and honestly monotonous which totally out weighs any satisfaction I might get for winning any battle (having died 43 times to win once!) \n\nIDK might be for you, definitely a hard uninstall for me, my biggest regret is that I didnt request a refund.\n\nYou might say skill issue and id totally agree. Motivation to get better at the game is 0, nuff said.",

Only about 5% of the content in the game is required to beat it, so there's a huge exploration/discovery aspect that makes the game especially satisfying your first time through. Additionally, there's a lot of diversity for builds and the wide breadth of possibilities will leave you wanting to start another save after beating the game. The game presents a difficulty that makes conquering some of the bosses and the game in general very satisfying. And as if the base game wasn't enough, the DLC is a massive add-on that nearly doubles the amount of content. I cannot recommend this game enough.",

I never expected to play this game, let alone purchase it, but I had the opportunity to try the game for myself, thanks to a friend. It was all true. To a new player, the lands between can be a brutal place. It is also the most beautiful, immersive, and awe-inspiring world I've ever explored in a video game. The challenges are worth the rewards. I am not the target demographic for this game, but I'm not alone, either. So many people have fallen in love with Elden Ring because it is a masterpiece. If you have considered playing this game, but you are worried about the difficulty level and the learning curve, I encourage you to try it. While it is challenging, nothing about it is insurmountable. I am not a hardcore player, or an avid Souls fan. I'm not even that good at combat. All you need to enjoy this game is an appetite for adventure.",

The story took longer for me to get into than Dark Souls, but once I did it was just as fun to uncover as in that series. Beautiful world design, challenging and fair boss fights except for Malenia (who lore wise has never lost a battle so I can half forgive it) It's one of the greatest games of all time.",

Even with that, there was no way I could be ready for THIS PIECE OF ART. \n\nThere are many crevices to explore, weapons to collect, spells to cast, armor sets to equip, quests to finish, bosses to kill. This game has literally everything, not to mention that every area feel different and unique. \n\nExcept Caelid. All my homies hate Caelid.\n\nFYI, if you're planning to play with your buddies please download the Seamless COOP mod. It removes a lot of restrictions that are in the base game and makes it more enjoyable. \n\nBurn the Erdtree to the ground, and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.\n\nAhhh, may chaos take the world! \n\nMAY CHAOS! TAKE! THE WORLD!\n\n10000000000000/10\n",

However, due to the unreasonable interpretation of the competition rules by the organizers, he was forced to withdraw from the competition. This discriminatory behavior against Tekken players has caused widespread dissatisfaction. It is an insult to every Tekken player and fails to uphold the spirit of fair competition. It also poses potential unfairness and harm to the interests of players from various countries participating in Tekken sports events. Namco Bandai's loss of the spirit of Tekken competition and discrimination has led to a negative review for Tekken 8, ensuring that this shameful act by Namco Bandai and the organizers is remembered in history.",

It will save your life.You gotta play it or your life will forever be a dreary mire of suck.\" \r\n\r\nIf you want to co-op, stay away. Fromsoft has tried for years to make it clear that multiplayer in their games is mixed, as in you can't co-op without PvP, but people consistently miss this. If you love the unique invasion PvP of Souls games, or even if you're just intrigued by it, probably stay away as well. The implementation of invasions in Elden Ring is the most frustrating it has ever been. Really, anyone trying to multiplayer in this game is going to have a difficult time.\r\n\r\nSouls games--including Elden Ring--are unique in their demand for methodical gameplay. If you need something to fight against until you finally prevail (which some of us really do need), these games are great. They are a long and beautiful solo journey. The world is grim and intricate. The storytelling is... listen, they leave lots of holes for you to fill in. Is it good storytelling? Yes. The method of writing only half the story is a known and respected technique, and Fromsoft uses it very well. \r\n\r\nBut the game IS demanding in its gameplay, and you won't realize how much you have to bash your head against some of the fights for hours until you're well past the refund mark. So, if you don't want to find joy in the defeat of frustration, maybe give Souls games a pass. They won't change your life (unless you really need to beat your head against something until it breaks, which some of us do, and in which case this game is really quite good).",

        "review": "my first experience in the soulslike world. finally i completed the game (cutscene ending), but there are still a few legendary bosses, after 100 hours of play, i’m not yet 100% complete because i got too lost in exploration—haha!\r\n\r\nas a newcomer to the soulslike genre, i entered elden ring with enthusiasm and hope. i thought, \"how hard can a game be?\" oh, how naive i was! with stunning graphics, a spine-chilling soundtrack, and exceptional voice acting, i felt like a hero in a fantasy film... until i was smacked by my first boss\r\n\r\ncombat in elden ring isn’t just a battle of punches; it’s a test of patience and sanity. i often found myself adapting with new strategies—which usually meant i was running away and hiding while screaming, “please, don’t kill me!” when i finally defeated a boss after dozens of attempts, it felt like winning the lottery—what an epic moment!\r\n\r\none of the best aspects of elden ring is the freedom to create your own fighting style and build. you can experiment with various combinations of weapons and abilities based on what you think works best for you. there’s no wrong way to play, making the experience even more personal and enjoyable\r\n\r\ni also discovered that grinding is fun! i spent hours leveling up my character, only to occasionally run into monsters that wanted to tear me apart. however, each mistake i made resulted in hilarious and valuable experiences\r\n\r\nmany say elden ring is easier than dark souls, but for me, it remains a significant challenge as a beginner. i still hope to reach 100%, although i might need to negotiate with a few bosses for a little leniency\r\n\r\nso, if you enjoy open-world games, exhilarating boss fights, and want to experience gameplay filled with laughter and tears (the tears of rage and frustration), elden ring is a must-try. this game has been incredibly memorable for me, and the intriguing, in-depth lore adds to the allure, making every exploration feel more worthwhile. happy adventuring, and may you not get beaten up too much!",

I havent even beaten yet im still on my first game and I havent picked this game up in over a year I genuinly cant find it in me to play it anymore or even be interested in the thought of it and seeing everyone else enjoy it and the DLC is so weird to me? I say definitly play it if you are interested but if you start getting disinterested in it good luck trying to pick it back up.",

It has so many spells, hundreds of weapons choices and AOW to customize your own unique experience to play however you want too, either to challenge yourself or just have fun. This was probably the first game I installed when I switched from console and I couldn't help myself not 100%-ing the game again. Such a well made game, definitely recommend.",

        "review": "Elden Ring is nothing short of a revolutionary triumph in the realm of gaming. FromSoftware has delivered an open-world experience that not only builds on its storied legacy but redefines what players can expect from a fantasy RPG.\n\nThe world of Elden Ring is a breathtaking expanse filled with rich lore, stunning landscapes, and intricate details. From rolling hills to daunting castles, every corner of the Lands Between invites exploration. The verticality of the environment and the seamless transitions between diverse biomes create a sense of wonder that keeps you captivated. Each area feels meticulously crafted, with hidden secrets and breathtaking vistas that reward the curious.\n\nThe combat mechanics are polished and satisfying. Building on the fluidity and intensity of previous titles, Elden Ring introduces a versatile combat system that allows for a range of playstyles. Whether you prefer melee, magic, or a hybrid approach, the customization options are abundant. The satisfaction of landing a perfectly-timed hit against a challenging foe is unparalleled, and the variety of enemies keeps encounters fresh and exhilarating.\n\nThe multiplayer features enhance the experience, allowing players to summon friends for cooperative play or engage in competitive PvP. The ability to share the journey with others, while maintaining the atmospheric solitude that defines the series, strikes a perfect balance. Graphically, Elden Ring is stunning. The art direction is a visual feast, with striking designs for landscapes, enemies, and character models. Coupled with an atmospheric soundtrack and haunting sound design, the game envelops you in its world, making every moment feel impactful.",

And often bosses that at first seem impossible are doable, even for a noob like me. You just need to find the right strategy, die a fair few times finding it, then die a fair few more managing to do it.\n\nA good game after all.",

The story is hard to follow because is broken and sporadic, very little information is given, which makes it difficult to follow a logic path. The controls are designed and thought for consoles, so good luck making the required moves and weapons changes in a PC. Its unfairly hard in order to hide the fact that is boring to hell.

The combat is intense, and the bosses will test your patience, but it’s that classic Souls difficulty that keeps you coming back for more. It might take a bit to get used to the mechanics, but once you do, every victory feels earned and satisfying. If you enjoy tough games with rich lore and plenty of freedom to explore, Elden Ring is a must-play!",

        "review": "Elden Ring is certainly a contender for the best \"Souls\" game. \r\n\r\nThe Open World of the game is massive, and the developer has done a very good job of filling that space with interesting points of interest, treasures, and optional bosses. \r\n\r\nA note on approachability: \r\n\r\nThis game features some of the most difficult bosses ever put in a game (such as the infamous Melania, Blade of Miquella) and yet, at the same time, is also by far the most approachable Souls game so far because of the Open World. If you find yourself having a very hard time against a boss, you can spend some time exploring new areas and dungeons and killing optional bosses, and this will give you the Runes needed to get a few levels which will make the boss you were stuck on easier to kill. Before Elden Ring, the only way to become more powerful in the face of a difficult challenge was to go to a prior zone and repeatedly reset it, killing the chaff mobs that spawn in each time. With Elden Ring, there is very little need to do that, because of the sheer number of points of optional zones and points of interest. Instead of repeatedly resetting a zone, you can explore. It feels so much better.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that the game is \"easy\" -- absolutely not. The bosses are, for the most part, extremely well designed and appropriately difficult. Gamers seeking a challenge will complete Elden Ring feeling very satisfied with the endeavor. \r\n\r\nThe variety of weapons and spells in this game is also incredible, and that combined with the Open World aspect of the game make it highly re-playable. \r\n\r\nBut that gets me to my biggest problem with Souls games in general; the dated and, frankly, boring \"RPG\" systems. It feels very bad to get a new weapon that you would like to try, only to realize that in order to properly give the weapon a go, you will have to fully re-spec your character using a rare and non-farmable resource and then upgrade that weapon using runes and smithing stones. \r\n\r\nIt is this reviewer's sincere opinion that the player stats in this game should be outright removed. It does not add a level of complexity that is actually interesting; all it does is prevent the player from being able to take full advantage of the incredible plethora and variety of weapons available to them. \r\n\r\nI just want to be able to use awesome weapons, FromSoft. Please make a game that lets me use all of your weapons without having to jump through boring hoops.  \r\n\r\nFor this reason I cannot give Elden Ring (or any Souls game) a rating of 5 stars. The dated leveling system really holds these games back for me. \r\n\r\nHowever, that aside, the game is incredible. 4/5 stars.",

        "review": "A downgrade from the Dark Souls series in almost every way except visuals.\n\nMain issues:\n\nEnemy attacks are extremely fast and non-stop, so there's no time to strike back, with only a couple fake out attacks thrown in there so you mess up your dodge timing. That's it. That's the whole formula. Almost every enemy in the game except fodder does this. Spam attacks, a couple huge wind up 1-shot attacks, then back to spam. It's not fun to play against, it's just a barrage of crap in your face with no relief. Is it doable? Sure, with enough time and patience. Is it satisfying? Nope.\n\nSummoning randoms: how does it work? You find summon signs at the little posts dedicated to summoning players, but i've only had signs appear for me once after using the item for it. Trying to summon them in caused an error and they were immediately disconnected. Maybe I'm just unlucky and nobody's online, but I find that pretty hard to believe. Playing with others makes fighting manageable, maybe even fun, but the convoluted and vague summon system just makes it a headache.\n\nPerformance issues! I've gotten significant framerate drops in almost every open area in the game. PC specs are comfortably above recommended, and can run more visually impressive games at high FPS so there's no excuse for the tanking framerate. I've also got some weird audio bugs happening sometimes, enemies jumping through terrain, and janky horse stuff. \n\nCAMERA. Holy smokes, the camera is gotten worse in this one. It doesn't help that some bosses are too big to be fun, but against large enemies the cameraman is halfway up the baddie's arse and I'm trying to figure out which direction I should be swinging in. For example, a dragon boss takes place underground. It charges at me, spewing lava everywhere. I get hit, and the camera decides it's the best time to clip into the boss and show me the ceiling while I'm actively being smashed into the wall. It swings to look at everything EXCEPT me for a solid 3 seconds, and by that time I'm long dead. Fire the cameraman, get a new one.\n\nOk, that's enough complaining. 4/10, if you must play bring a friend.",

Visually stunning no matter if it is effects, the world setting, boss's and their arena's etc. Then the weapons are all very unique and the ashes of war add on so much more to them. The spells in this game all looked majestic. The bosses all felt impactful on the journey to becoming Elden Lord. By this I mean you hear about them a good bit from other bosses or characters throughout your playthrough so you know they are a big deal. I can't say enough good things about this game in one review.\n\n It's a must play if you like souls games. A must play if you like a challenge. Over all it is just a must play game.",

But getting back on track it is, and always will be, an excellent game. I actually bought it when it innitally  came out, obviouslly had some difficultys in different areas, had to respect once or twice, and rage quite for half a year at the aforementioned fire giant. I had a lot of hardships, but hardly beat half the bosses, if that, and that is a rough estimation. Despite everything I hope to beat it on pc at this point in time, and believe in the amazing game. (please forgive spelling errors I was really typing this out before playing, was in liurnia last)",

This game cannot be compared to others so easily, it demands a playthrough (I'd recommend playing blind on your first run through) and it requires nothing but the indomitable human spirit and the will to go on after each boss fight! Once again, I cannot praise this masterpiece anymore than i already have, If you believe this game might be hard, bring some friends along and then go on an adventure of your own and make the world yours. Highly recommend!",
